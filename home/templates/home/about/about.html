    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>Silver Chips Online (SCO) is dedicated to representing, defending,
      informing and entertaining the Blair community.
      SCO publishes all newsworthy stories that pertain to the Blair community as well as seeks letters to the editor.
      SCO provides a forum for student expression and strives to represent Blair's vast diversity in the content of its paper.
    </p><p>
      Silver Chips Online strictly follows its mottos of nullae morae (no delays) and nullae
      rationales (no excuses).  No delays. SCO is accessible to readers at all times.
      SCO staff is always there to report on whatever happens, as it happens. Without
      detracting from writing quality or adherence to journalistic standards, stories
      are written and posted as quickly as possible.   No excuses. Newspapers work
      on deadlines.  If deadlines are not met, chaos ensues.  To avoid chaos and to
      create a good paper, deadlines are absolute.  Stories and other work must be
      turned in on deadlines regardless of circumstances.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      Silver Chips Online was founded by Dan Zytnick during the 1998-1999 school year as an
      online list of Silver Chips print edition stories, though "online only" news and sports
      stories and web-updates became common soon after.
    </p><p>
      Since its inaugural year, Silver Chips Online has greatly expanded its staff and mission.
      In the 2000-2001 school year, under Editor-in-Chief Daina Klimanis, Silver Chips
      Online had six staff members and began writing more of its own stories instead of simply
      posting the latest print edition. Under Editors-in-Chief Joe Howley and Robert Day
      during the 2001-2002 school year, the site received a major redesign and began to
      produce many more "Online Only" stories. In 2002-2003, Silver Chips Online, headed
      by Editors-in-Chief Kevin Chang and Jeanne Yang, added a large number of new
      reporters and the content of the site became dominated by "Online Only" stories.
    </p><p>
      Editors-in-Chief Branden Buehler and KC Constanzo led Silver Chips Online in
      launching a new site design during the 2003-2004 school year. That year, Silver Chips
      Online was given the National Scholastic Press Association (NSPA) Pacemaker award, an
      honor that identified it as one of the three best online high school newspapers in the
      nation. Buehler and Costanzo, along with Managing Editors Cori Cohen and Robin
      Hernandez, attended the NSPA Conference in San Diego, California, that year to receive
      the award. The site was also given the 2004 Marylander Award by the Maryland-DC
      Scholastic Press Association.
    </p><p>
      During the next school year, Silver Chips Online doubled in size to a staff of 45 writers
      and editors. That year brought an expansion of site features, including the College
      section, the Foreign Desk section, the Ask Chips column and numerous site specials,
      such as Homecoming and Election 2004 coverage. Under the leadership of Editors-in-
      Chief, Vivek Chellappa, Allison Elvove, Ely Portillo and Katherine Zhang and Technical
      Director Jeffrey Dunn, the site was once more awarded a Pacemaker.
    </p><p>
      The following year brought another Pacemaker award under Editors-in-Chief
      Christopher Consolino, Jeremy Goodman, Grace Harter and Alex Mazerov and Technical
      Director Erik Li. The site expanded to include a Food section and Back Page, and
      continued to provide excellent coverage of local events â€“ including President Bush's
      2005 visit to Montgomery Blair. The site won the 2006 Marylander award as well.
    </p><p>
      Online Managing Editors Meaghan Mallari and Tasha Prados created an Online
      Spanish Section during the 2006-2007 school year to further diversify the site. In addition to serving
      as the Editors-in-Chief of the Silver Chips Online Spanish Section they wrote the Spanish page for the Print edition. In Spring
      of 2007, Editors-in-Chief Merlyn Deng, Eve Gleichman and Payal Patnaik  introduced MyChips, a new feature designed to e-mail updates to
      5 Silver Chips Online, 2012-2013 subscribers. That same year, Silver Chips Online became a part of Google News and
      attracted attention from local media for its coverage of the controversial color-coded ID
      policy that had been implemented and was again awarded the Marylander award.
    </p><p>
      In the 2007-2008 school year, Editors-in-Chief Priyanka Gokhale, Pia Nargundkar and
      Rachita Sood and Technical Director David Dunn launched a complete site redesign,
      adding a 3-0-1 weekend section and Blair Connection to the website. The site was given
      the Marylander Award that year and the next, under Editors-in-Chief Sophie Schwadron
      and Kiera Zitelman. 2009 also saw the introduction of various specials, such as Blair
      Pair, Obama's First 100 Days and coverage of the March Madness and the Super Bowl.
    </p><p>
      In 2009-2010, Editors-in-Chief Deepa Chellappa and David Tao and Technical Director
      Wylie Conlon redesigned the site in the fall of 2009, building a new logo and stylesheets.
    </p><p>
      In the 2010-2011 school year, with only five senior editors on board, Editor-in-Chief
      Ava Wallace maintained the site and created a Twitter account, jumpstarting the site's
      presence in the social media world. The following year, Editors-in-Chiefs Melodi Anahtar
      and Marjorie Fuchs continued this trend by creating a Facebook page for the site.
    </p><p>
      Brittany Cheng and Langston Taylor served as co-Editor-in-Chiefs during the 2012-2013
      school year. During their tenure, Cheng and Taylor redesigned the front page, incorporated
      live tweeting into SCO's repertoire, added Print Archives to the site via Issuu, and expanded
      the SCO's use of multimedia elements by teaming up with Blair Network Communications to
      produce video pieces. In the process, SCO won the 2013 Columbia Scholastic Press Association
      (CSPA) Gold Crown Award in the Hybrid category.
    </p><p>
      Aanchal Johri and Jack Estrin served as co-Editor-in-Chiefs during the 2013-2014
      school year. During their tenure, Silver Chips Online was the only high school
      newspaper invited to cover the State of Science, Technology, Engineering and
      Mathematics Address. Johri and Photo Staff Editor Emma Howells represented Silver
      Chips Online at the White House for this event.
    </p><p>
      From 2014 to 2017, some of Silver Chips Online's projects included an extensive social media campaign, expanded blog categories, and a
      #Blazers section. With continued coverage of the school and its surrounding area, the
      paper continued to uphold its rank as one of the best in the nation and increase its ability
      to report on all Blair events and other information of interest to the Blair community. Its editors-in-chief included
      Zoe Johnson and Dylan Ahunhodjaev (2014-15), Max Foley-Keene and Eleanor Linafelt (2015-16), and Eleanor Cook
      and Randima Herath (2016-17).
    </p><p>Starting in 2016, Silver Chips Online collaborated with the Montgomery Blair Sysops to completely redevelop
      and redesign its website. The effort was undertaken with an eye on future maintenance and flexibility,
      promoting content visibility and accessibility, and a freshened, modern, streamlined user experience and look-and-feel.
      A team of Sysops, led by Noah Singer ('18) and including Ian Rackow ('19), Mark Jung ('19), Noah Kim ('18), Simon Chervenak ('20),
      and Liam DeVoe ('20), replaced the old PHP website with a completely new, open source, Python/Django platform.
      They worked with editors-in-chief Mehana Daftary and Amy Forbsacka (2017-18) and Nobline Yoo and Rebecca Wessel
      (2018-19), who hope that the new website will help them restructure Silver Chips Online to better serve the Blair community.
