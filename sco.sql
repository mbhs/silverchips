The RNA takes over the cell’s reproduction mechanisms, commandeering our cells into virus-producing factories.	\N	2020-06-02 00:50:00+00	2020-11-24 01:50:39.62077+00	Shashi Arnold	0	t	3	9	\N	\N

33115	College credit from the couch	This year, students not only took AP exams from the comfort of home, but in a fraction of the previous three hour time limit. These limitations extend to restrict the number and type of questions on the test, and even the content covered. While the College Board, the for-profit “non-profit” that has monopolized the standardized testing industry, would like to believe that their blissfully shortened 45-minute AP tests will be enough to demonstrate students’ mastery of a subject, this is simply not the case.	\N	2020-06-04 01:12:01+00	2020-11-24 02:16:09.603586+00	Abby Brier	151	f	3	4	54	\N

33201	Success	Katrina also gave advice on becoming a better artist skill-wise and trying new things. “This might sound cliche, but literally just try it, you have nothing to lose, the worst that could happen is that you could make something and not like it,” she said. If you're considering trying something new during the pandemic, do it!	\N	2020-12-28 23:01:26+00	2020-12-28 23:02:53.130181+00		294	f	3	9	\N	\N
33196	Works of Art	Katrina Warren, a Blair senior, has been an artist since long before quarantine. However, the pandemic has influenced her art. “It's given me more time, but at the same time sometimes you know when you have a really busy schedule it gives you more inspiration to do stuff whereas when you have unlimited time it can be hard to be creative, but overall, it’s been good,” she says.	\N	2020-12-28 22:43:06+00	2020-12-28 22:44:02.445675+00		302	f	3	9	\N	\N
33200	Self Portrait	Katrina is one of many who have felt the lack of motivation during quarantine, despite the extra time. Her advice to overcoming it is: “Try as much as you can to FaceTime other people and talk to your family members a lot, just the more interactions you have with people, the more inspired you’re going to be,” she said.	\N	2020-12-28 23:00:07+00	2020-12-28 23:01:23.873983+00		313	f	3	9	\N	\N
33203	Scarf Up Close	Using knitting to pass the time, “At the beginning of quarantine, I started this vest and did it actually when I was watching movies,” Allegra describes.

33198	Melting Away	This painting is Katrina's most recent work. Her inspiration for this one came from her AP Literature class. “We’re reading a lot about existentialism and how this one author Albert Camus was very strong on just focusing on the simple pleasures of life like a cigarette or a glass of wine or those little luxuries, but if you focus on those things you can see how she’s happy in the moment, but she’s also sorta melting away,” said Katrina.	\N	2020-12-28 22:58:17+00	2020-12-28 22:59:04.846732+00		283	f	3	9	\N	\N

33205	Potholder?	Allegra has found that knitting has benefitted her mental health during quarantine. “It was calming, and it was also something to do with my hands which was nice,” she says. Allegra’s advice for other artists is this: “Just do what you feel like. I didn’t have a specific plan. I said ‘What should I knit?’ and my dad said, ‘A potholder,’ and I was like ‘It's better as a hat.’”	\N	2020-12-28 23:51:38+00	2020-12-28 23:52:25.268796+00		128	f	3	9	\N	\N

33199	Tiny Details	Artists are constantly growing and improving. Katrina explained that her growth has mainly focused on shifting from solely painting pretty pictures to taking on big concepts. “As I’ve grown older I’ve kinda realized there has to be more behind something for it to hold more meaning so that’s kinda what I’ve been trying to do and I think I’m getting somewhat close,” said Katrina.	\N	2020-12-28 22:59:09+00	2020-12-28 22:59:47.284437+00		313	f	3	9	\N	\N

33117	Hoards and hauls	Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many have found themselves struggling to get by. Small businesses are hustling to keep themselves afloat, school districts are scurrying to create successful online learning systems, and medical staffers are working excruciatingly long hours to help those in need.\r\nTo lessen the spread of the virus and its chaos, state governors have urged citizens to stay home by enforcing stringent stay-at-home orders––some states even administering fines for non-essential travel. This has led many Americans to stockpile on everyday items. People are hoarding exorbitant amounts of items—from rolls of toilet paper to cases of water—just so they can be prepared. While this reaction is understandable, stockpiling is doing more harm than good.	\N	2020-06-09 01:22:26+00	2020-11-24 02:25:49.18096+00	Khayla Robinson	155	f	3	4	54	\N

1	Robert is currently a senior enrolled in the Montgomery Blair High School Magnet Program. Son of two Asian parents makes Robert Chinese. If you didn't make the connection, it also makes him Asian. Born on the 25th of February of 1984 means Robert is a Rat according to the Chinese, and a Pisces according to the Zodiac. Someone unknowingly made the egregious mistake of assigning this rat/fish character to the on-line staff of Silver Chips. When he's not misspelling articles for Chips, he's drilling holes at Physics Team, losing arguments for Mock Trial, missing deadlines at Sysop business, sleeping instead of programming on Computer Team, playing cards with the Math Team, or amusing himself with the computers at Robotics Team. Once in a while he'll look away from his computer screen and migrate to the volleyball court and stand around looking like he knows exactly what he's doing. If you happen to get lost enough to be driving down the C&O canal, you might see him strenuously pedaling on his bike, but getting nowhere. You might also encounter him at the local swimming pool, probably in the baby pool scaring all the babies.\n		Page Editor	2002	1	f
2	Joe Howley is a senior at Blair in the Communication Arts Program. He is Editor-in-Chief of the Online division of Chips and shares the Graphics Editorship with the infamous Brandon Proia. He is resigned to being a hopeless computer "geek," and is already an object of much ridicule in the Online division for using a handheld computer. Joe is also, in his spare time, a writer, having entered the Bucconeer Student science Fiction contest for the last three years, placing as a finalist, semifinalist, and winner, in that order. He has had an editorial piece published in the <i>New York Times</i>.  In a past life, he played the cello, and theoretically still does. Currently, he attempts to play the electric bass, with emphasis on the blues. He enjoys A. E. Housman, Terry Pratchett, Shakespeare, and Timothy Zahn, in approximately that order. Joe supports the right to bear arms, but only for bears, because they would look silly on anything else. He will admit to being a Star Trek fan, and is proud to declare himself a devout NPR listener.  This is a really old version of his bio and someone should have told him to write a new one, goshdarnit.		Page Editor	2002	2	f
3	Jeanne Yang is an Asian (yes, that means black-haired brown-eyed) girl in the Maggot (err, the Magnet . . . ) Program at Montgomery Blair High School.  She spends her time doodling her little anime drawings, chatting with friends online, and struggling to complete her homework. If she has any spare time, she spends it bothering her two pets (a.k.a. her brothers), practicing the violin, and doing other forms of procrastination. Jeanne has lived in many places of the Eastern and Southern US. She was born in Alabama on October 6, 1985, and has lived in Texas, North Carolina, New Jersey, and finally moved to Maryland two weeks after her youngest brother was born in 1995.  Yes, do the math, and they are ten years apart. Scary, isn't it? Anyway, she is proud to declare herself a member of the class of '03 (YEAH 'O3!!).  Oh, one more thing. If she isn't found doing one of the above-mentioned items, she is sometimes sighted at one volleyball court or another trying desperately to set with the few fingers she has left that aren't jammed or bruised.		Page Editor	2003	3	f
4	Annie Peirce is a senior in the Communications Arts Program and the public relations manager for Silver Chips. She is also an opinions editor for Silver Chips Online.  She was born on October 25, 1984, in a hospital somewhere in Prince George's County; but doesn't remember many details from that period.  Since then, she has been a soccer- player, a piano player, a dancer, a gymnast, a singer, a writer, and an actor.  Only the last two activities have continued to have considerable relevance in her life.  As a writer Annie hesitantly seeks to publish her own fantasy short stories.  As an actor she kills people, Latin dances, and serves tea with a British accent on Blair's stage.  When she is not doing homework or one of the aforementioned activities, Annie reads, watches too many movies, and makes mix tapes of different genres.  As the director of PR for Silver Chips, Annie is responsible for all the posters hanging on Blair Boulevard and all the Info-Flow announcements. She proudly accepts responsibility for the paper's lack of humility.		Page Editor	2003	4	f
5	Floral is a hard-working senior on Silver Chips. If she could live, breathe, and eat Silver Chips, she probably would. If Silver Chips was a religion, she would be a part of it. If Silver Chips was a utensil, she would eat with it. If Silver Chips was a road, she would live on it. Oh, what would she do without Silver Chips?		Page Editor	2003	5	f

7	Kevin Chang was born on April 28, 1985.  This makes him a bull, and coincidentally, a Taurus. Somehow, he ended up in the Magnet program at Montgomery Blair High School, where he is now a SENIOR!  03!  Yes, he is a geek.  He is often getting questions wrong on homework and failing tests, but when he's not, he'll be getting questions wrong for the 'It's Academic!' team and helping them to lose at competitions instead.  Finally, someone made the mistake of assigning him to <i>Silver Chips Online</i>, where by some strange twist of fate he is Editor-in-Chief this year in addition to being the Technical Editor and one of the Graphics Editors for <i>Silver Chips</i>' print edition.  He spends his free time, waitaminute, he doesn't have any free time.		Page Editor	2003	7	f
8	Jeremy Hoffman serves his second year on <i>Silver Chips Online</i> as the System Administrator.  Following in the footsteps of Robert Day and Joe Howley, he'll be writing the code that makes the online paper work.  Jeremy was born in D.C. and raised in Bethesda.  His activities include Chess and Philosophy Club, and he is delighted to have found others who still play <i>Magic: the Gathering</i>.  He admires the philosophy of Socrates, Locke, and Douglass Adams.  As a magnet senior, Jeremy hopes to work hard, have fun, and maybe even learn something.		Page Editor	2003	8	f
9	Ben Meiselman is a senior in the Communication Arts Program at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland.  He enjoys playing sports, especially baseball.  Ben is seventeen years old, born May 16, 1985.  He has played the trumpet since fourth grade when he began at Pine Crest Elementary School.  He continues to play in the jazz band at Blair with his original teacher, Mr. Kurt Lucas.  Ben is an active member of Habonim Dror, a Jewish labor Zionist youth movement.		Page Editor	2003	9	f

11	Max Brett is a senior at Blair, and is the Online Sports Editor and a staff writer for Silver Chips. His tireless efforts have helped the online section become what it is today. Just last year, he wrote a rap review the Saturday Evening Post called 'positively captivating.' Max wrestles for the school team, and according to his teammates he is 'no good' and 'a setback.' Nonetheless, Max tries his best and last season won the sportsmanship award - - for JV. All kidding aside, Max loves sports (his teams are the Falcons, the Braves and Georgia Tech) loves art (Cy Twombly) and music most of all (Jimi Hendrix, Beethoven). Also to be noted, last year he beat BNC (the bratty little sister of the Blair Media bodies) in a wall-sitting contest.		Page Editor	2002	11	f

This is her second year on paper although she was enrolled in Mr. Mathwin's journalism class both semesters two years ago.  Katie has played field hockey and softball for the past three years.  Her hobbies include music and one day she hopes to become internationally famous through her success as guitar player and vocalist for a chick band which includes her friend and page editor Juliana Stevenson.  Katie is considering pursuing journalism in college, depending on her experience on Silver Chips this year. She currently lives in Kensington, Maryland and commutes monthly to visit her father who is a profesor at Duke university in Durham, North Carolina. During the summer, Katie works at Burgandy Center for Wildlife Studies, a sleep away camp located in Capon Bridge, West Virginia. If she had to pick the ultimate movie of summer 2000, it would be X-men the movie.		Page Editor	2002	13	f

17	Liam Bowen has loved sports, baseball in particular, since he saw Jeff Ballard pitch for the Orioles in the late-80s. When he isn't on the beat, Bowen ties up his daytimes with his misguided and entirely unrealistic dream to play some sort of advanced baseball someday, somewhere. If you see him in the hall this year and he doesn't tell you how Blair is going to win the state baseball championship, count yourself lucky. \n		Page Editor	2002	17	f

24	Co-editor-in-chief Stephen Wertheim is deeply committed to reporting, even when it conflicts with such essential life activities as food consumption, sleep and viewership of Seinfeld reruns.  In addition to getting carried away with writing and playing violin, Stephen thoroughly enjoys visiting and photographing spots around the country, though his perception of the northeast was scarred at an early age when he fell down in the Rockefeller Center ice rink and was bitten brutally by penguins.  Following his smashing theatrical success, "Bacterium & the Bride" (dubbed from French to English and back to French again), Stephen is currently drafting a second motion picture, this one about a cunning death row inmate who orders Chinese for his last meal and stretches out the leftovers over several weeks, delaying his execution.  Among Stephen's unanswered questions are whether there is an afterlife and how Wal-Mart comes up with a price of $39.56 for an electric skillet.  Stephen's future may contain careers in journalism or government, or he may scrap those ideas entirely and move to Wheaton to play duckpin bowling for an indefinite period of time.

The future is now, but she'll worry about that tomorrow.		Page Editor	2003	38	f

In fact, she has so enjoyed her forays in high school journalism that she is thinking about pursuing a career in the field after college.  In addition to writing journalistically, Elizabeth enjoys writing creatively.  She recently won second place in Merlyn's Pen magazine's short story contest.  The winning story will be published in an obscure hardcover book that perhaps a few people will read this fall.  Elizabeth spends time not devoted to the paper working on Silver Quill, her college applications and her social skills. She would like to add, in all modesty, that this volume of the paper (64) is likely the best yet.		Page Editor	2002	43	f
44	Omar Guerrero is will participate this year on Silver Chips for a second year.  Guerrero was born in Managua, Nicaragua on April 20, 1984, the baby of the family, including an older brother and sister.  The family moved to the United States in 1988 to start a new life in Maryland.  As his life went on, Guerrero gained an interest in many things, including basketball, college (Go Maryland) and pro (Go Miami), baseball (Go Yankees), playing alto saxophone, piano, and of course writing.  In the future, one might see Guerrero writing for a newspaper or working in one of many fields in law enforcement.  Guerrero joined Silver Chips last year as a Staff Writer and this year has moved up to become Chips' Senior Page Editor, which basically means that he's a senior AND a page editor (Oh my!)  Feel free to email Mr. Guerrero with any ideas, complaints, "shout-outs" and, for the ladies, phone numbe...I mean, "contact information." (He\nlikes to joke around too, can you tell?)

45	Samantha Henig is proud to be the lone senior on junior staff.  She brings experience, insight and class to the junior staff that otherwise may be absent.  Samantha spent her junior year at a small private school in Manhattan, where she wrote for a paper that was utterly atrocious.  She is glad to be back at Blair, and thrilled to be on the Chips staff.  When she is not working on newspaper, Sam participates in intramural floor hockey, Silver Quill, Silver Quest and recreational soccer and basketball.  She is also an active member of the step team.

47	Kristin Hoven, managing page editor, is a senior eking out her last year in Blair's fun-filled math/science magnet program.  She is an avid quilter and shoemaker, and, despite the persistent rumors, modestly denies (in that cute Aw shucks kinda way) that she is the most amazing and wonderful person EVER.  She is looking for a man who can appreciate her quilting and shoemaking and who will buy her lots of pretty things.  Bald is okay.		Page Editor	2003	47	f
49	Kang-Xing ("Mr. K") Jin is a senior in the Blair magnet program.  His first name is pronounced exactly like it is spelled--"consin," as in the last two syllables of Wisconsin, where he was born.  This year, he is co-managing news editor of Chips. Besides journalism, Kang-Xing's academic interests include computer science and mathematics.  He is a member of the math team and was a member of Blair's first place senior division American Computer Science League team last year.  Outside of school, he enjoys violin, piano and tennis.

51	Irene Liu, along with her trusty buddies Jen and Nick, returns to the Chips staff this year as an Executive Business Director.  She credits her vastly improved communication abilities to the incredible job she held over the summer as an intern at the Smithsonian's Freer and Sackler Galleries of Art.  Working in the Department of Public Affairs and Marketing led her to realize that she, too, could talk to strangers without choking on the phone.  As a senior, Irene is now looking ahead to college and considers Oberlin and UMCP as her top choices.  She really really wants to study music and chemistry and probably talks in her sleep about double-degreeing.  Aside from pursuing her post-secondary education, Irene is still involved in theater, Chinese Club, Silver Quill, tutoring, and of course piano.  She's also proud to add that she just passed another test in karate, so her goal of getting a black belt by graduation might very well be realized.  Her other life ambitions include birdwatching and stargazing until she can't move her neck, meeting the DJs of WGMS, and one day owning the movie and soundtrack to "Shine."		Page Editor	2002	51	f

56	Ben Penn, a senior in the Communication Arts Program, is thrilled to be taking on the role of managing sports editor for Silver Chips.  While holding the position of page editor last year, Ben is proud to say that he was the only person on Silver Chips staff who covered a sports beat all year (girls' soccer, boys' basketball, and baseball).  But of all of Ben's many achievements since the day he was born on December 16, 1983, the one that he takes the most pride in is his critically acclaimed sports column in Chips, titled the Bull Penn.  Ben cannot remember off the top of his head the names of the critics who acclaimed it, but he knows they're out there somewhere.  Ben knows that Silver Chips is a full-time job, but there is nothing he loves more than to come home to his lovely wife, kids, dog and cat, and to sit back on the Lazy-boy with a brewskie in one hand and remote control in the other.  \n\nGetting back to reality, Ben wishes to go to college and study journalism.  If this career fails, he will pursue his goal of growing up to become Eugene, from David E. Kelley's The Practice.		Page Editor	2002	56	f
57	Alex Piazza is a junior page editor for Silver Chips, one of the better newspapers of the world.

Alex enjoys songwriting and his musical influences include everything from Sublime to Bob Dylan to Led Zeppelin to Molotov.  He's ivisted Peru, the place of his family's origin, many times.  Alex has no idea of what he aspires to do, so he'll probably just settle down and be a freelance trash guy.		Page Editor	2003	57	f
58	Jared Sagoff, a Silver Chips Managing News Editor, was born on April 17, 1985. However, a possibly more significant moment occurred when he was selected to the Silver Chips staff for this, his senior year, two springs ago.

Unfortunately, these are mutually exclusive.		Page Editor	2003	58	f

She also loves to listen to music, eat, and sleep, though now that school's started, the whole sleeping concept has yet again become an unfamiliar one.

Three more scholastic years were endured before his unexpected acceptance to the Blair Magnet. After a failed attempt at joining the affiliated "Soccer Team," he languished physically, eventually heeding the call of the Dramatic and Musical arts.

And he wonders why he never has time to do anything.\n\nIzzy is a horrible driver and is proud of it.  Kinda.  Proud of being one of a very, very small population of Japanese people at Blair (fie on thee, "Japanese" Club!)

He's also the producer of "GameTime Montgomery", a half-hour cable television show devoted to Montgomery County's sports.  So why is he here?  In addition to occasionally writing sports stories for SCO, he links SCO's sports stories to the highlight reels that relate to them, so that everyone in the internet community can enjoy a big heaping serving of Sports-Networky goodness.  Exciting?  Not really.  But somebody's gotta do it.		Page Editor	2005	219	f

235	Jessica Yen is a senior in the Math, Science, Computer Science Magnet Program. You will find her most often staring in front of her computer, playing around with Adobe Photoshop or Macromedia Dreamweaver, with coffee in hand. Despite long hours spent in amazement and wonder of the computer and other hours spent wondering why the computer has been infected with yet another virus, she gets her fair share of athletics. Jessica has been taking kung fu for over six years; she cannot wait until she gets on her Double Dagger form. She is also a bench-warmer on Blair's Gymnastics Team.

239	Pratik Bhandari is (now) a 5'6" SENIOR who (still) weighs about 125 pounds. He came from India, which could explain his diminutive stature and lived there for three years before moving to Albany, the capital of New York believe it or not, and finally to Maryland. \n\nOther than work on SCO (haha) and take hour long bus rides to and from school - because of the godforsaken traffic and the fact that he lives in GERMANTOWN!?!?!?! - Pratik also likes to play badminton. That's right, badminton. Pratik is also uber-competitive and slightly annoying which gets him into trouble all the time. However, he uses his charm (yeah, right) and an unlimited arsenal of bad jokes to survive.\n\nSomehow, he has risen to the status of sports editor which basically allows him to act as if he has a really important job while giving him a great excuse for watching the Redskins.\n\nFour years from now, Pratik hopes to be working on a degree in aerospace engineering and having lots of fun at some top-notch college (like MIT or UMCP).\n\nHis perfect day would probably include lots of sports, lots of sleeping and lots of eating (He has a high metabolism, okay?) . Probably not all at the same time though...\n\n              "Save me Jebus!!!!!"\n              -Homer Simpson		Page Editor	2006	239	f

He likes jazz and classical music, but mostly listens to experimental instrumental rock.  His favorite band is King Crimson (1972 - 1974).  He plays guitar, bass, and piano, and is a proud '06 magnet.  Jeremy tries to maintain a detached, Seinfeldian lifestyle and would die before becoming a vegetarian.\n\n<i>"All men dream, but not equally.

259	Luke McQueen, despite being constantly mistook for various celebrities, business moguls, and world leaders/dominators, leads a relatively humble life. He is especially humbled by the world of journalism and, in particular, <i>Silver Chips Online</i>. This is mainly because it's his first year at SCO, but he plans to make short work of that! When it comes to jazzing it up, his weapon of choice is either the piano or trumpet. His other hobbies include ultimate frisbee, movies, and saying the phrase "And that's how it's done" at completely inappropriate times. He is a man of integrity.		Page Editor	2006	259	f

242	Zahra Gordon is 16-year old JUNIOR at Blair who is overwhelmingly proud of being from the Caribbean twin-island nation of Trinidad & Tobago (and she never fails to mention that). She has been living in Maryland for four years. \n\nIf you're ever trying to find Zahra on a weekend, your best bet is to head on down to Hyattsville, MD, where she can be found just about every Saturday (and some Friday nights too) practicing with fellow band members on the only instrument invented in the 20th century; the steel pan. The pan is also the national instrument of Trinidad & Tobago (no, it's not Jamaican though they do play pan in Jamaica and that is not a problem). \n\nMoving on though, Zahra enjoys listening to a variety of music, reading, writing poetry, making lasagna, going for walks, long bus rides, dancing and being creative in general. Zahra is anxious to be a member of <i>Online</i> this year and hopes to do immensely well. \n\n		Page Editor	2006	242	f

From that moment, he was raised in a life of luxury; first as the inspiration for Quizno's "Baby Bob" commercials, and later taking over Lil' Bow Wow's role in the Broadway musical version of "Like Mike."   While not being a senior at Blair and writing for SCO, Mike travels the nation as part of Willie Nelson's entourage, and is the  fill in host of the "Montel" talk show.

250	<p>Erik Li was born on Jan. 10, 1988, and spent the first half-year of his life in the USA before moving to Germany for the next two years of his life.  Interestingly enough, he remembers none of this (he was much too young – i.e. his memory extends only about a year back, if he's lucky), but his parents do seem to have a rather large stash of incriminating photos.</p><p>He has long had a rather unhealthy interest with climbing various objects.  As a child he would climb chairs, tables, laps, couches, etc.  Now, of course, he limits himself to trees, cliffs, roofs and the occasional bleacher.  In addition to climbing, he enjoys wushu, soccer, drawing (although he sucks at it), graphic design, techie stuff (Yes, he's in the Magnet.  No, he's not an uber nerd.  He thinks. ), and good friends.  Hmmm… maybe friends should be first in that list.  Oh well, too lazy to change that now.</p><p>I suppose I should mention that as another charming facet of his personality, he is a lazy bum and an extreme procrastinator.  As in, do-it-in-the-eight-minutes-before-class type procrastinator.  Someday he'll have to work on that.  Although "someday" does have that rather redeeming quality of being somewhere in the far future.</p><p>It should be noted that he gets easily annoyed at times (particularly with his two brothers), and is prone to irrational behavior.</p><p>By the by, running from girls is not irrational.  They have a rather bad tendency to fight dirty and, for some reason, always seem to win any argument.  Someday (see above) he'll have to look into that and figure out why.<p><p>Anyways, he probably has a long list of dislikes hidden around somewhere, but as he lost it (he's always losing things.  Just look at the half-foot paper pile in his backpack), I guess you'll just have to use a guess-n-check method.</p><p><i>Disclaimer:  Erik Li is not responsible for any unwanted side effects caused by the dangerous guess-n-check annoyance list method.

251	Ekta Taneja is a magnet <b>senior</b> with a passion for SCO, books and rugged-looking fighters from all universes and time periods. She's a modest poet with an unappeasable thirst for cinnamon-sprinkled hot chocolate overloaded with whipped cream and richly-flavored pina coladas that come with cute little umbrellas.\n\nEkta aspires to be a spitfire first mate in the 15th century to a certain eccentric pirate with a bird for a last name who is captain to the fastest and blackest ship in the Caribbean. After that, she's considering visiting Drasnia to learn how to talk with her fingers, Middle-Earth to master archery and Florin to learn fencing from the Wizard, all in preparation for her ambitious plans of universal domination. The fun is in the conquest, so once she's universally addressed as Evil Overlady -embellish title to your heart's content-, she'll go on vacation to Saturn, leaving the universe to squabble over her vacated post.\n		Page Editor	2006	251	f

Instead, she wants to be a Red Oak, or a Curling Grass, or, if neither of the above, a pediatrician. \n\nShe's constantly surrounded by a bustle of children or by her childish friends. In the rare moments when she is alone, June likes to paint, play the piano or guzheng or hockey, watch black-and-white films, and talk with her daddy; but she usually can't because there is a mountain of homework to finish. \n\n<i>...speaking of which...</i>		Page Editor	2006	261	f

If you are in the immediate vicinity when this should occur, you are in danger of being awed by his moves.

He is an admitted golf addict who dreams of a vacation in St. Andrews but hangs around the local municipal courses to get his fixes.  His second hobby, playing the stock market, is generally more remunerative but less engrossing than the first.  \n\nHyder is a very busy person. In addition to his formidable course load, he plays on Blair's golf team, plays clarinet in the Marching Band and  serves as Chief Justice of the SGA Review Board.  He also plans to be in this year's spring musical.  He swears that one of these days, the stress will drive him insane.  Of course, there are plenty of people who would say he is that way already.\n\nHyder enjoys the music of Frank Sinatra, Benny Goodman and Dean Martin, although he also loves country and is a self-professed aficionado of classic rock.  A true citizen of the DC metropolitan area, he is a die-hard 'Skins fan and often sports a red Nationals cap.  And in case you were wondering, this color does reflect his(fairly strong) political views, much to the chagrin of just about everyone around him.  Hyder can usually be seen lolling and milling about in clothing he got for free or from yard sales, oblivious to the fact that his garments are about twice his age.\n\nHyder has a first name, but can't remember the last time he or anyone else actually used it.

391	Iliya Smithka will graduate from neither the CAP nor the Magnet Program.  However, she somehow managed to get a decent education.  While representing no particular program during her stint on Silver Chips Online, Iliya was a spectacular staff writer, although she never really mastered the elusive art that is a nut graf (mostly she hung with her peeps Clement and Betsir, and of course her main man Will).\n\nIn other words, Ms. Smithka is absolutely ridiculous and stunningly gorgeous.  [Does that not count as a nut graf?]\n\nIliya enjoys playing for Blair's fabulous field hockey team, playing phantastic phrisbee, reading/writing/rithmetic, sailing the seas and using alliteration (gotcha!).  She also enjoys singing but unfortunately Iliya has very little natural ability in that department.\n\nA Unitarian Universalist and feminista, Iliya often has flashes of profound brilliance, asking, "Why are we here?" "Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?" and "How come Chinese isn't on the food pyramid?"\n\nIn her former lives, Iliya was a gypsy-pirate and a British politician.  She aspires to do many things in this lifetime, among them being accepted into Harvard but not going, learning Italian and/or Arabic and owning a purple pick-up truck.\n\nIn the Bollywood movie musical of Iliya's life, the drama queen and super hero will play herself opposite Drew Lachey (who was absolved of all uckiness from 98 Degrees by playing Mark in Rent on Broadway for two months).\n\nSeriously though, Iliya will most likely major in oceanography, political science or psychology, and pursue a career in any of those wonderful fields.\n\nIn conclusion, Iliya is probably partying like a rockstar, seeing as how she likes to pop, lock and drop it, even while on the Youth and Government trip to Annapolis.  Ay, mami make it roll...		Online Staff Writer	2008	391	f

Instead of working during class, she naps, plays Text Twist, and listens to country music.  Elsi tends to have very tragic experiences involving dead animals and would rather not relive them.

524	The high point of Deepa's life thus far occurred when she waved to Mickey Mouse at a Disney World parade and he blew her a kiss in return. Needless to say, she hates Minnie with a passion.\n\nIn her free time, Deepa can be found chasing after little yellow tennis balls, dancing (Indian-style!), singing (Indian-style!), playing the violin (see a pattern yet?) and eating burritos. She feels that watching Top Chef should be a prerequisite to…everything. \n		Online Editor-in-Chief	2010	524	f

533	Sonalee (suh-NAH-lee) is a chipper Chipper and a would-be magnet junior. She spends a great deal of time playing tennis (Blair is red hot), doodling, reading, quoting famous people, quoting not-so-famous people and lamenting her inability to play the piano. She is also a big fan of the Food Network and Top Chef, and feels strongly that Paula Deen is being unfairly allowed to monopolize daytime cooking television. Her pet peeve is the misspelling of the word "psycho." If you ever need her, you can find her halfway around the world living vicariously through the rest of the Chips staff.

563	Rebecca Guterman loves being on Silver Chips! In what little spare time she has left over, she loves to play the piano, dance really badly, and listen to music. Above all, seeing and talking to friends 24/7 is a must. Even though most of her life has been taken over by school, she also loves watching TV and movies. Anyone who does not like the shows Gilmore Girls, House, and the West Wing should not come near...along with anyone who hates Johnny Depp. Rebecca believes that everyone should visit El Salvador before they die, especially the village Cacahuatal, which is the most awesome place on the face of the planet and should take Spanish, not French, because El Salvador will be a little more fun if you know some of the language. Any questions? Email me at my BILL account because I'm too paranoid to post my personal email. I'm really a very nice, mostly normal person despite this bio and I hope you enjoy reading my stories for Chips!		Print Managing News Editor & Public Relations Director	2010	563	f

She has met Elvis and has literally seen pigs fly.  She single-handedly got Barack Obama elected to the Presidency, pays only $4 for a $5 footlong at Subway, and makes 30-minute meals in only 20 minutes.

783	Hi everyone--my name is Dylan Ahunhodjaev. The first name is Welsh (but I'm not Welsh) and the last name is Uzbek (I'm Uzbek, from Uzbekistan, or at least my dad is). My parents met in the Peace Corps. It's a cute story, remind me to tell it to you sometime.\nA little about me: I'm a Gemini, and I love punk rock music. As a writer, I'd say I gravitate towards stories that are heavy on opinions. So op/eds. But I love any- and everything related to writing/journalism, and I think there's beauty in  any kind of story. I'm looking forward to a great year as your editor-in-chief; I hope I can be a source of guidance not only as a writer and editor but also as a spiritual guru, physical beacon, mental titan, expert sailor and avid band-knower.\n\n"It drops deep as it does in my breath/I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death" - Nas\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brvhmQm9EkQ		Online Editor-in-Chief	2015	783	f
784	Hi, I'm Birhan and I'm one of the news editors. I participate in Blair Theatre and Sankofa :) I am 100% fluent in Amharic. I have my foreigner moments so if I randomly start talking in Amharic, do not be surprised. I am a bookworm. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and/or Maximum Ride series, I will automatically like you. (Although, I still need to finish the Maximum Ride series). Do not worry though, I will still like you even if you are not a fan of those books or even if you are not a bookworm. I am a pretty easy-going person if you approach me, so do not be scared to come up and say "hi" and talk to me.		Staff Writer	2015	784	f

It's not like she can sing anything else.\n<br>\n<p>\nWhen sick with a 101-degree fever, you can find Grace at the piano bench, practicing her pieces with a musical passion. Other than that, what piano? She doesn't play piano, contrary to what her piano teacher says.\n	images/2018/08/01/10195.jpg	Staff Writer	2011	585	f

I could live off of Cosi TBMs and Signature Salads, with the occasional Quattro Formaggio pizza thrown in for variety. I collect vinyl records, mainly of my favorite band, The Beatles. As John and Ringo said, "What was it that first attracted you to me?" "Well, you're very polite then aren't you?"\n	images/2018/08/01/12459.jpg	Online Managing Editor 	2012	643	f

Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams; it learned to breathe fresh air.

973	My name is Terrence Wong. I'm 16 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Silver Spring, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as a staff writer for the Silver Chips Online publication, and I get home every day by 6 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I don't drink. I'm in bed by 1 AM, and make sure I get five hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up with fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.		Staff Writer	2021	973	f

32408	Why people choose to adopt or volunteer for shelters, paired with photos from an adoption event.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A person’s best friend, a childhood companion, a furry friend. Pets are an important part of people’s lives. But where you get them from is just as important. Animal shelters, like the Humane Rescue Alliance, work to provide a temporary home for animals until they get adopted. While animal shelters have many different events, the public adoption events are one of the most popular. By hosting an event in public, the chances of adoption can increase with the increase in visibility.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32397"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Adoption is emphasized by animal advocates over buying from a breeder for several reasons. A common phrase said by animal advocates is “adopt don’t shop.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">HRA volunteer David Martinez said, “I would always say definitely adopt and don’t buy from a breeder.

32651	Blair swim and dive lost 179-191 in a tug-of-war matchup against Poolesville	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The week before divisionals, the Blazers suffered their first defeat of the season, losing 179-191 to the Poolesville Falcons. Blair almost recovered from a significant point deficit to steal the second half of the meet, keeping onlookers anxious and hopeful until the very end of the meet.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Most of our races were close today so that means that during our divisionals it’s going to be a really good meet especially between us, Wooton, and Poolesville.” stated coach Kelley Labriola</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the loss, the girls gave one of their best performances of the year, challenging Poolesville every step of the way. Over the course of the meet, they outplaced the boys in the 200-yard IM, 50 and 100-yard freestyle, and 200-yard freestyle relays.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The first few races set a bleak mood for the boys, as their placements faltered in the face of a speedy Poolesville team. As the meet approached the halfway point, it seemed that the heat inside the swim center would wear down Blair’s swimmers to a swift and definitive defeat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This all changed in the second half of the meet. The Blazers galloped past the Falcons race after race following their five-minute break, quickly regaining the points they had lost in the first half. Consistently claiming top positions in heats, the Blazers became an imminent threat to the unsuspecting Poolesville team.﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32650"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers dominated the Falcons, completely sweeping Poolesville in the boys’ 100-yard backstroke heat. Yet these Herculean pushes took place a few races too late, and were unable to close the score gap completely.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To adapt for the upcoming divisional championships, the Blazers look to use this loss as a reference to re-strategize from. “There are definitely some changes we are going to have to make to the lineup that I have made already based on how well Poolesville did today and what they swam. So, I am going to take a look at that and rearrange our relays and a few of our individual swims.” Labriola reflected.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will compete again on Saturday, Feb. 1. at 7:30 a.m. as they take on the top teams from the season at the division two championship.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32650
32324	The 15-mile Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) was removed from MDOT’s budget	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Oct. 29, Montgomery County officials held a press conference and community town hall to speak out against the recent removal of the Corridor Cities Transitway (CCT) from the Maryland Department of Transportation’s (MDOT) list of priorities. The removal left the program to be funded by the county, causing backlash.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The CCT was planned as a 15-mile Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">between the COMSAT research facility near Clarksburg, Md. and the Shady Grove Metro Station. The bus line was designed to pass through crucial city centers like Downtown CROWN and the Metropolitan Grove Station.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32323"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The proposed plan included dedicated lanes for the BRT to travel on and their own signaling system. The measures were all part of an initiative to make the BRT a faster option for commuters going to congested areas in the upper county.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The transit line has been in development for over 20 years and has gained massive support from local universities like Johns Hopkins, as well as from businesses and politicians. Yet despite the support from the community and county leaders, the latest draft of the </span><a href="http://www.mdot.maryland.gov/newMDOT/Planning/CTP/CTP_20_25/Draft_Documents/MDOT%202020-2025%20Draft%20CTP.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Consolidated Transportation Program</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> shows that CCT has been removed from the Development &amp; Evaluation Program.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This decision by Maryland Governor Larry Hogan leaves Montgomery County to completely fund and take responsibility for the bus transit project. The total cost of CCT is an estimated </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/transportation/state-ends-commitment-to-corridor-cities-transitway/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">$800 million</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">—money that Montgomery County does not have, Montgomery County Delegate Kerill Reznik said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reznik said that the project will not be able to go on without state funding. “[MDOT] wants Montgomery County to pull out the money, but the county does not have the money at this time. So, at the moment, if the state does not pay for it, then CCT is dead,” Reznik said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The purpose of the BRT was to help with traffic congestion. The bus transit system would not only make transportation faster, it would also make it cheaper. According to Resnik,“There are people who cannot afford tolls and cannot afford cars. They’re stuck and this will help them.”  </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The BRT is not the first plan proposed to alleviate traffic on the roads. Earlier this year, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/maryland-plan-to-widen-i-270-first-could-make-traffic-worse-toll-lane-advocates-say/2019/10/11/7796dba6-e495-11e9-b403-f738899982d2_story.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Governor Larry Hogan unveiled a plan</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to widen I-270 and build additional lanes instead of adding public transportation. This plan received backlash from the residents that would’ve been affected, and the plan is currently still at a standstill.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">County leaders believe that following through with CCT will be more efficient than Hogan’s proposal of building more roads. “We don’t believe that building roads will be better for the environment but rather create more traffic,” Reznik said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Most of the BRT’s stops are intended to be in economic development centers where developers are ready to move in and build residential housing, commercial spaces, businesses and other institutions. County Executive Marc Elrich believes that without the CCT, the county will not be able to approve much more development and tens of thousands of potential jobs would vanish, according to </span><a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2019/10/29/montgomery-officials-say-states-transitway-decision-imperils-tech-industry/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Maryland Matters</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Going forward, Montgomery County politicians will continue to hold press conferences and community panels to pressure the Maryland administration into backing the CCT.

33068	An April 24 bill caps the extent to which landlords can raise rent during state of emergency	<p>County Executive Mark Elrich signed the COVID-19 Renter Relief Act on April 24 prohibiting landlords from raising rent more than 2.6 percent during or for the 180 days after Maryland’s state of emergency.&nbsp;</p><p>Councilmember Will Jawando proposed the bill in response to reports from Montgomery County residents that their landlords were dramatically raising rent, in some cases by over 40 percent. “We need to now, more than ever, protect our vulnerable populations,” Jawando said in a council meeting.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33067"></div><p>The bill was co-sponsored by Council President Sidney Katz as well as Councilmembers Nancy Navarro and Craig Rice.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the bill originally called for a complete ban of rent increases, Councilmember Tom Hucker introduced an amendment to allow rent increases of up to 2.6 percent, the County Executive’s recommended annual rent increase based on the rental component of the Consumer Price Index for the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan area. The amendment passed by a 6-3 vote, with Councilmembers Jawando, Rice, and Navarro voting against it.&nbsp;</p><p>The original proposal to completely halt rent increases drew concern. Councilmember Tom Hucker cited lost revenue in the form of taxes, the risk of a lack of a fiscal analysis regarding a ban on rent increases, and the ability of upper-income residents to pay the additional 2.6 percent as some of the reasons why the amendment was necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Other concerns included the fear that landlords would suffer if they were not permitted to increase rent at all. “We need to recognize that building owners also have obligations,” Councilmember Hans Riemer said in a council meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some housing organizations emphasized the need to ensure that landlords would be able to cover necessary maintenance costs. “There are continued expenses on the housing provider's side… and some increased expenses,” Nicola Whiteman, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs at the Apartment and Office Building Association of Metropolitan Washington, said. “You have more people sheltering… but that also means that some utility costs are increasing.”</p><p>The amendment faced criticism from some housing advocates. “We oppose any amendments that would allow for an increase [in rent] during this time,” Matthew Losak, co-founder and executive director of the Montgomery County Renter’s Alliance, said. “Renters, which make up 40 percent of the region’s population, are made vulnerable when rents are increased during this period and their housing becomes unstable.”</p><p>Potential rent increases are a source of stress in the lives of some families who have already been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Rent is a big obligation every month, and with my mom's pay being cut, there needs to be some sort of reassurance that it's not going to go up,” senior Cecelia Dworak, whose mother’s working hours have been cut in half because of the faltering economy, said. “If rent was to go up, that would be pretty detrimental to our family.”</p><p>Throughout negotiations, Jawando ardently maintained that any increase in rent would harm tenants. “Whatever those marginal increases you receive as a property owner from people who could afford them are not going to get those property owners out of the disaster we’re in, but it could devastate the people who are impacted by it,” Jawando said in a council meeting.</p><p>Despite disagreements about the change to allow rent increases, all involved agree that the bill was a necessary measure to protect both renters and landlords. “It's not what I had hoped for, but it's better than not having any particular guideline at all,” Councilmember Navarro said.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the COVID-19 Renter Relief Act, the Montgomery County Council unanimously approved $2 million in emergency funding to provide emergency eviction protection and rental assistance.&nbsp;</p>	33067
33348	John David Washington and Zendaya shine in Netflix’s latest original written and directed by Sam Levinson	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Released on Feb. 5, “Malcolm &amp; Marie” is an inherently risky film. Made in black and white, starring only one actor and one actress, in one location and devoid of special effects, its simplicity is rare in modern Hollywood. Yet, it works. While not perfect, “Malcolm &amp; Marie” offers an interesting look at what makes romantic relationships succeed, and more importantly, what makes them fail.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33347"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Simply put, “Malcolm &amp; Marie” is a feature-length </span><a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">bottle episode</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a television trope where opposing characters are stuck in one location for the entirety of the runtime. The plot focuses on Malcolm (John David Washington, son of Oscar-winner Denzel Washington), an up-and-coming filmmaker and his girlfriend Marie (Zendaya) as they return from the successful premiere of Malcolm’s first big movie. At the premiere, Malcolm mistakenly thanked everyone except Marie. Throughout the film, the pair fight, smoke and eat mac &amp; cheese as they examine their own flaws, pasts and current relationship.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While resembling bottle episodes and stage plays, “Malcolm &amp; Marie” is also reminiscent of a boxing match. Each performer is a fighter, using words to combat one another, with musical interludes breaking up each round. Through this, “Malcolm and Marie” escalates and deescalates conflict. It’s an interesting idea that may offer some realism to the film, but the roller coaster feeling works less well in the second half than in the first. This format eventually tires itself out as the characters sink too deep into the drama, and the film’s simple premise becomes its downfall.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Director and writer Sam Levinson pens a good, but not perfect script. While it focuses primarily on the drama and tension between the two leads, it does a good job bringing out the raw emotion of the characters. For such an intense film, Levinson also adds wonderful moments of levity that help flesh out the leads and their relationship. Levinson also delves into the role of politics in modern filmmaking through Malcolm’s monologues, but not to the point where the film becomes any sort of political statement. It’s slightly confusing for the viewer, as it becomes unclear if the haphazard nature of tossing in the statements is the point of them or not. Levinson choices from behind the camera are also well-done, as he blends close-ups and wide-shot to show the intimacy of their relationship as well as the distance between them</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, the standouts of the film are Washington and Zendaya. In a film as simple as this one, every possible flaw would stand out tremendously, especially when it comes to the acting. However, this isn’t a concern, as the two are phenomenal.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The winner of an entertaining fight is whoever throws the last punch. In “Malcolm &amp; Marie,” the best performer truly is the speaker of the last line. Washington is excellent in every scene. In moments where humor is needed, he brings it effortlessly. His charisma comes through his long-winded monologues while his anger and passion are also palpable when needed.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Simultaneously, Emmy-winner Zendaya continues her domination of the entertainment world with another stunning performance. She showcases her brilliant range, with as much ease acting emotionally unavailable as she is acting emotionally unstable, her deep hurt evident with every line. The chemistry she has with Washington is real and without a doubt what makes this film “work.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yes, “Malcolm &amp; Marie” is a flawed success. A challenging premise, but somehow successful due to the stellar performances by Washington and Zendaya. If you have a Netflix account, spare the time and watch the movie.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">3.5 Stars.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Malcolm &amp; Marie” is rated R for pervasive language and sexual content. It is now available to stream on Netflix.</em></p>	33347
33182	Controversy, criticism, and digital American premier leave the film with a disappointing payout.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOn Sept. 4, Disney digitally released the live action remake “Mulan” to Disney+. Even before the film premiered, it was surrounded by controversy, which caused many people to call for a boycott of the film.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDiscussion about a boycott emerged yet again after its release as consumers realized the lack of Asian representation behind the camera. Despite the all-Asian cast—which created the perception of diversity—none of the directors, screenwriters, or costume designers were of Asian descent.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t“I think that what we're seeing here is some of the growing pains of Hollywood wanting to be inclusive in terms of storytelling, and yet behind the scenes are not able to or wanting to,” Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist who teaches at Biola University’s School of Cinema and Media Arts, told NBC News.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDisney expected Mulan, which had a budget of $200 million, to be a big success in China, but its performance has been lackluster. Kenneth Seat, who teaches East Asian Studies at Blair, feels that the lack of Asian representation in the production team may be a reason for this. “The remake was made to be played in Chinese theaters as well as for American consumption, but on the other hand, it seems that it fell flat in China. Perhaps it would have helped if the director was Chinese next time,” he said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33181"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chinese moviegoers also felt that the movie was not accurate to Chinese culture. According to an article in The New York Times from September, a common complaint was that “the filmmakers were trying too hard to pander to China but did not try hard enough to get their historical facts right. They made Mulan too westernized yet still succumbed to Orientalist stereotypes.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAnother potential cause for the movie’s low ratings in China may be that government authorities banned media outlets from covering the film’s release. According to Reuters, no official reason was given.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tRegarding the movie’s plot itself, many fans were disappointed that Disney made so many changes from the 1998 animated version. According to The Washington Post, Disney decided to make these changes in order to be more accurate to Chinese culture and the oldest known version of the original legend, The Ballad of Mulan.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t“I was disappointed in the plot because I thought that they should have either gone with something that felt more familiar to the original Mulan and had a lot more of the humor and some more familiar characters or they should have got a whole different direction and stuck with the plot of the legend,” junior Kiah Beachler said. “I think they didn't balance it enough and instead of trying to find a middle ground they should have just gone one way or the other.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tJunior Anastasia Matveev agrees that the film’s plot fell short of expectations. “I was sort of disappointed in the weird paths the plot took,” she said. “It just didn't feel like it was following any actual message or concrete ideology. There were plot points that didn't really add to the overall message the movie was trying to convey.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMatveev also appreciated the message of the original film. “I just thought it was nice that it gave Mulan power. It wasn't just for the sake of female empowerment. It wasn't performative, it felt real,” she said. “It felt like a narrative that young girls could watch and a character that they could look up to.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tSophomore Kai Jenkins thought that the new film lacked the charisma of the original. “I think that the Disney magic was taken out of it when they didn't include any singing,” she said. Matveev agrees, as she thinks the new movie didn’t improve upon the old one. “I really like the composition of the original,” she said. “Everything about it. The music, the voice talent, the animation.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tJenkins also thinks that Disney made a bad move by filming the new version.“I think they shouldn't have made the movie because I feel like it was more of an action movie than a Disney movie.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDisney was clearly making an effort to honor The Ballad of Mulan. However, many audience members feel that the company needs to work harder to improve ethnic representation behind the scenes and create more original content. This could very well be a wakeup call for Disney to start telling new stories instead of remaking their existing films to pander to people’s nostalgia.</span></p>	33181
33536	The Broadway musical-turned-movie was not perfect, but was emotionally powerful nonetheless	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33535"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Theater geeks everywhere have been blessed with a cinematic remake of one of the most relevant musicals created in recent years. The film adaptation of “Dear Evan Hansen,” the hit Broadway musical of 2018, was released on Friday, Sep. 24. Fans of the musical have been eagerly awaiting its release, but the musical's transition from Broadway to cinema&nbsp;has opened floodgates of criticism. Though fans of the Broadway musical may be slightly disappointed by this reproduction as it pales in comparison to the original performance, “Dear Evan Hansen” is still an emotional film that brings the best parts of its stage performances to the big screen.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Dear Evan Hansen” follows the story of Evan Hansen (Ben Platt), a high schooler grappling with social anxiety and depression. After high school peer Connor Murphy (Colton Ryan) dies by suicide, Evan lies and claims to have been Connor’s best friend. In the beginning, Evan’s lie helps him form new relationships and gain both confidence and popularity. But lies only last so long, and Evan soon faces the repercussions of deceiving his community.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Numerous critics brought up multiple points of contention regarding the film’s creation even before it was released, the most prominent of which being the casting of Ben Platt as Evan Hansen. Though the Tony-Award winning actor was the first to step into the role on Broadway, many pointed out that Platt was turning 28 this year. How could a fully-grown man play a high schooler on screen? Movie cameras were not as forgiving as the distance and darkness that Broadway theaters provided.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, no one else could have done this role justice. At least not like Platt, a talented actor who performed as Evan Hansen eight times a week for over a year when the musical was still on Broadway. Although brief close-up shots make his make-up and wrinkles painfully obvious, Platt's uncertain stance, awkward gait, the way his lips and cheeks twitch, and the movement in his fingers showcase the depth of his expertise with the role of Evan Hansen. Platt’s grey eyes are particularly captivating as they offer the audience a window into Platt's mind where they can observe his vulnerability, happiness, and fear.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But the most important reason why no one else could have performed this role is definitely Platt’s voice. A glorious vibrato when Hansen is excited, a gentle falsetto when he is calm, cracks you can hear when he is crying -- audiences can’t help but be moved by its subtleties. Ben Platt’s extraordinary vocals are indisputably this movie’s saving grace.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The director, Stephen Chbosky, is no stranger to movies centered around teenage struggles. The author and director of “The Perks of Being a Wallflower”, Chbosky has a knack for picking the perfect shots to most accurately relay the common teenage experience. “Waving Through a Window”, the musical’s opening number, takes place with a pep rally in the background. Excited kids and athletes whizz behind Evan in a swirl of banners and pom-poms. Our protagonist feels lost and unseen in the crowd. This scenario is one that many of us are all too familiar with.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Scenes that are more raw, like Evan shuddering on the floor of the school bathroom or montages that describe memories of Evan’s traumatic summer, demand such emotional responses from the audience that they are almost uncomfortable. Admittedly, some parts of the movie are a bit cliché, but that is only to be expected. It is, after all, a high school drama.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The one aspect of this movie that was right on the money was definitely the casting. Nik Dodani plays Jared Kleinman, Evan Hansen’s best “family friend”, with the perfect amount of sarcasm. Watching Danny Pino as Larry Murphy cry over the death of his son for the first time is heartbreaking. Julianne Moore’s breathtaking performance as Evan’s mother in “So Big/So Small” was another high point of the film.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">And while this movie did have numerous positive aspects, it was not perfect. The plot makes many viewers particularly angry, as many of Evan Hansen’s actions are cruel and border-line sociopathic, making it difficult to root for him throughout the film. However, the movie is about a flawed teenager. He does terrible things, and Evan’s actions are in no way justified by the movie’s creators. Hating this movie for the plot only results from a lack of understanding regarding its creators’ goals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, with all that being said, should you watch it?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yes. There is something in it that every viewer can relate to in some way, and its message promoting the importance of mental health awareness and the dangers of social media are universal. The film is definitely worthy of two hours of your time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3.5/5 Stars</span></p><p><br></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dear Evan Hansen is rated PG-13 for suggestive references, brief strong language, suicide, and thematic material, and is now playing in theaters everywhere.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p>	33535

One Legacy. One Blair," with both the opening and closing speeches addressing the unnecessary divide between the former Wayne Avenue campus and present University Boulevard campus. "The idea was to keep the connection. It didn't matter which campus you went to; it says Montgomery Blair on the front, and that’s what’s important,” Chair of the Alumni Association Mark Levin stated.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The induction ceremony commenced with a quick preamble from Principal Renay Johnson and Levin, and transitioned into a presentation of the Shoop Shoop song from the Blair Drama Club’s production, "Return to the Forbidden Planet."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Association inducted eight new members into the Alumni Association Hall of Fame: Steve Barber, a professional baseball player;&nbsp;Malcolm "Mac" Beasley, a professor and prominent physicist; Carol Mehrling, the first female police chief of Montgomery County; Eliot Pfanstiehl, a music icon; Brian Magid, a Blair sports star; Jacque Crenca Hinman, CEO of Fortune 500 company CH2M Hill; Carlos "Chick" Hernandez, a local sportscaster; and Craig Rice, a member of the Montgomery County Council.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32263"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Spanning politics, sports, science, business, and art, the Association deemed that these newest inductees deserved recognition for being "talented, accomplished and impactful" in their diverse professions. This recognition stemmed from actions such as driving buses for disabled children, entertaining the public, and constructing cultural centers such as Strathmore Hall.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After brief introductions of each inductee, the audience watched a short video consisting of compiled interviews of close friends and family describing the inductee and reasons they were chosen for the Hall of Fame. The videos were compiled by Alan Goldberg from the Blair class of 1961.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If present, the inductee or a family member then gave a speech about Blair’s impact on their lives going forward and accepted the award. These speeches often referred to fond memories of friendship and what Blair as an institution stood for when they were in school.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another notable occurrence that encapsulated the night was the similarity between the various graduation classes despite the number of years separating them. “I think more and more that we do these kinds of things, the generations come together. It was interesting to hear somebody that graduated in the 50s talk about the same environment as the guy who graduated in the 90s did,” Levin said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many alumni reconnected with others who attended Blair and reminisced about their high school years. “it’s very awe-inspiring to see folk all these decades later [who] just feel so passionate still about their time at this school,” said Social Studies resource teacher Rahman Culver, who graduated in 1996.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"It's good to hear the pride. It's good to hear how Blair helped to elevate these people into their careers and the pride they have for their school and the name Montgomery Blair," Johnson said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	32263

The first cops to arrive saw Bomba suffering from gunshot wounds. He was quickly transported to MedStar Washington Hospital, where he died from his injuries.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There was no initial information about a possible suspect, nor was there evidence of people breaking any laws on top of the garage. Bomba was wearing his body camera however </span>﻿<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">it was never activated. The corner of Fenton Street and Ellsworth Drive was shut down, public transportation buses were interrupted on that road and nearby schools were placed on lockdown.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the police department's original press release, Bomba's death was reported as a homicide because there was no evidence to suggest his injury was self-inflicted.

32686	Blair Boys and Girls Swim and Dive took home first and fourth at division two championships	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Give me a B!...” Shouts erupted from the bleachers by the pool. “Give me an L!...” a similar roar filled the warm, energetic air by the pool as Blair swim and dive made their presence known. On Saturday, Feb. 1, the Blazers finished first overall at the swim and dive Division Two Championships as the boys placed first and the girls placed fourth.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The girls diving opened the meet, gaining a definitive lead over the five other teams present as freshman Ruby Borzekowski, junior Elise Kinyanjui, and senior Emily Harris placed first, second, and fourth. “[Diving was] very helpful for our girl’s team as we lacked a little bit of depth that the other teams had. It gave them a boost in confidence to have that lead” explained Coach Kelly Labriola.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32685"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers kicked off swimming with a burst of determination as the boys claimed first in the 200-yard medley relay. “The relay went exactly as I had hoped, to start [swimming] off getting first is always very exciting,” stated Labriola.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As cheering echoed around the interior of the Germantown Indoor Aquatic Center, the Blazers raced back and forth with swimmers from Wootton, Poolesville, Quince Orchard, Damascus, and Northwest, amassing points from consistently high placements on the leaderboard.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Seeded first in relays, the boys secured first place in two out of the three events. This earned them a much-needed lead over the other teams.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The girls consistently outswam their previous times as the meet pushed on. “Just looking at the way our seed times compared with the times we actually did, I think we really did a really good job and put great effort into it,” captain Allie Marney-Bell described.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers’ performance at Divisionals is a good sign for the team as they hope to continue improving towards the conclusion of the season. “I’m a little more excited for states as our boys 400 free relay has a really good chance of getting top three for their side and I feel like our girls are going to swim their best times as we go forward.” reflected Labriola.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32685
31771	Jal speaks on his journey from child soldier to recording artist	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On March 8, Emmanuel Jal visited Blair for the third year in a row to speak to Blazers about his journey toward becoming an artist and peace activist. Blazers crowded the auditorium during fourth period to listen to Jal's extraordinary experiences growing up in Sudan.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the start of the period, Blazers began filling the auditorium. Jal then made his entrance through the aisles of the auditorium singing "We Want Peace," as students held up peace signs in solidarity. Jal explained his efforts to share his story to instill a sense of global awakening.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jal was forced to join the Sudan People's Liberation Army when he was just eight years old, losing the opportunity to receive an education as a child. As a child soldier, Jal watch his own friends die, and he suffered in order to survive, even drinking his own urine to stay hydrated and shooting a crow so he could eat.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31770"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jal performed one his most powerful spoken word pieces, "Forced to Sin." To encourage an interactive environment, Jal used a call-back response with the audience. The piece reflected all of the painful decisions Jal was pressured to make while working to survive as a child soldier. His experiences have encouraged him to speak on appreciating the opportunities an education can provide. "We are all here to get the tools to make our dreams come true," Jal said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Eventually, Jal was able to flee from his war-torn country through the support of aid workers. British foreign aid worker Emma McCune adopted Jal, and even after she was killed in a car accident, he was able to continue his education and begin pursuing a career in music and peace activism. He is now an inspirational recording artist and peace ambassador in Toronto, Canada.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It was not easy for him to find his voice as a unique artist and activist, but he knew that these were the platforms he needed to speak out with. During a more intimate meet-and-greet during sixth period, he told students about what one of his first producers told him. "Becoming you will take time; for now you got to be different people. Your voice will come out eventually," the producer said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers were inspired by Jal's performance and the messages of unity and peace he brought to the table. Senior Lesly Garay-Rodriguez believed Jal expressed a beautiful sentiment on aspiring for our dreams. "He emphasized the importance of not letting obstacles get a hold of you and your dreams and to always achieve what you want to be," Garay-Rodriguez said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This event would not have been possible without the help of international human rights teacher Anne Manuel, Blair principal Renay Johnson and numerous other Blair staff. Manuel has worked closely with Jal to organize this event for the past three years. "Every time he comes to Blair, we get a new perspective of what resilience looks like," Manuel said. Jal hopes to visit again next year and continue sharing his story to the next generation of peace activists.</span></p>	31770
32641	The Warriors beat the Blazers by a score of 45-34	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (10-3) lost to the Sherwood Warriors (11-2) by a score of 45-34 on Tuesday night. This marks their second loss of the season against Sherwood, despite having the home court advantage for this game.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers struggled to score early in the game, as Sherwood jumped out to a 7-0 lead in the first 15 seconds.&nbsp;The Warriors' strong offensive rebounding allowed them to accumulate an overwhelming amount of second chance points. By the end of the first quarter, Blair had only scored six points, four of which were from junior guard Kate Hildebrandt. This led to Blair trailing 11-6.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Second quarter showed improvements by Blair. Shots by freshman guard Natalie Frost as well as Hildebrandt boosted Blair to tie the score at 17-17 with 2:20 left before halftime.A free throw and two-pointer by Sherwood in the last 22 seconds of the quarter left Blair behind at 20-17.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The third quarter was a turning point for Blair. Baskets by junior captain and guard-forward Peyton Martin and senior guard-forward Lucy Martin pulled the Blazers ahead to 21-20, their first lead of the game. Lucy Martin followed with a three-pointer, which motivated the Blazers. “We needed some energy on the court because there was some frustration; getting that energy made it so that we played better as a team and made us a cohesive whole,” Lucy Martin said.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32640"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The lead continued to trade hands throughout the quarter, but hasty passes and hesitant shots allowed Sherwood to outscore the Blazers. Sherwood dominated the fourth quarter with 14 points and limited Blair to six, leading to Blair’s ultimate 45-34 defeat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In spite of the loss, the team showed a visible improvement from their 71-58 loss to the Warriors on Jan. 7. “We actually came back in this one and got ahead. That really did not happen in the previous Sherwood game”, Coach Amy Ferguson said.&nbsp;"But even though we really came out third quarter, Sherwood came back ready in that fourth quarter, which totally changed the momentum. It was mostly just a difference in rebounding performances.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lucy Martin also reflected on the team’s performance. “We also didn’t execute well on offense; 34 points isn’t really a good score for us because we should be scoring more than that. We played good defense and we held them to a pretty low score for them. The defense and the hustle was definitely there tonight,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Wednesday, February 5th against the Walter Johnson Wildcats at 7:15 p.m.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Editor’s Note: Lucy Martin is the photo editor for Silver Chips Print.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32640
32333	The release of the new streaming service shakes the entertainment industry.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With the release of </span><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Disney+</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a new on-demand streaming service created by the Walt Disney Company this last Tuesday, the television industry is set to change forever. With its unbeatable prices, enticing bundle deals and mega conglomerate power, Disney+ is on track to overtake Netflix (currently at 158 million subscribers) as the world's largest subscription streaming service.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As of Wednesday Nov. 13, the first day after the Nov. 12 release, Disney+ has already </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/disney-surpasses-10-million-sign-ups-since-launch.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">surpassed 10 million subscribers</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. It is not only the old Disney Channel charm that makes Disney+ so desirable. In fact, Disney has played its most powerful cards, price and power, very strategically.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The </span><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/how-much-does-disney-plus-cost/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">standard Disney+ plan</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is $6.99 a month and includes 4K HDR content and unlimited streaming. This price point is almost $10 cheaper than Netflix’s $15.99 Premium plan that allows 4K viewing. For the new platform launch, Disney is also </span><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-hulu-espn-bundle?cid=DSS-Search-Google-71700000059463274-&amp;s_kwcid=AL!8468!3!396016611558!b!!g!!%2Bdisney%2B%20%2Bbundle&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAws7uBRAkEiwAMlbZjslj2SF20jF54vJ9UM-uCdDRY3MD-VTAhcizXoPcVRkK4-oJDRCTyxoCRHMQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">offering a bundle </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">of ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu for $12.99 a month. With such a drastic price difference, there is no question which service will look better on your bank statement.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The price and package deals are only the beginning. The way Disney+ has rocked the entertainment industry lies in the content. Disney+ is the first service to repeal all of its original content off of Netflix—and it’s a lot.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since 2013, Netflix has been the biggest pioneer of the streaming world, consolidating everyone’s favorite shows in a one-stop-shop. Now, Disney has pulled all of its million dollar franchises onto its own platform, stripping Netflix from many non-original shows. Disney has produced everything from all the princess movies to Mickey Mouse to Marvel to Star Wars, all of which are now exclusively on Disney+.&nbsp;Netflix is going to need a lot more original hits like “Stranger Things” to dig itself out of this hole.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Leila Faraday is worried about the multiple platforms and competing services. “It makes me upset, because I feel like Netflix was a universal place to have all my shows and movies. Obviously nobody wants to pay seven different fees to watch all their favorite shows, so it would be nice to have one big platform. I have, however, watched a few Marvel and Disney movies,” Faraday says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">So, does Disney+ really live up to its magical expectations? Yes and no. The platform’s format is almost identical to Netflix’s format. The saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it” definitely applies here.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the home page, the banner on the top scrolls through Disney’s arguably most anticipated and successful sagas like High School Musical, the Avengers and Star Wars. Underneath are Disney’s five major franchises: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. A click on any one of these buttons leads to a seemingly endless scroll of movies, shows and documentaries.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32332"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Below the five franchises are the main subcategories found on Disney+. At first glance, the Disney+ platform is well organized with a ‘Recommended For You’ section and an ‘Out of the Vault’ section that holds household animated classics like The Lion King. However, the deeper you scroll, the more you wonder about the necessity of labels like “Feel-Good Sports Movies” and “Best Friends.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Having almost 25 different subcategories, it is almost as if Disney is trying too hard to compare its depth and variety to that of Netflix’s library of movies. Although Disney has produced mega-hits, it is still not at the level of the amount and diversity of content that Netflix has.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Freshman Chelsea Pineda says that Disney+ does not really entice her away from Netflix. “I like watching comedies like “Big Mouth.” I’ve never really watched those shows Disney produced so it hasn’t really affected me,” Pineda says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even with certain downfalls, the mere concept of Disney+ is revolutionary. It is no longer difficult to stream and produce shows in one place. The accessibility of the industry paired with Disney’s monopoly drowns any inkling of competition in a mountain of sparkly blue pixie dust.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32332
33147	The arguments for and against face filters	<h3><strong>PRO</strong></h3><p>They are engaging and fun, and are hardly the root of unrealistic beauty standards.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33145"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Try to imagine what social media would look like with no filters. Instagram would lose the Starburst filter that decorates selfies with colorful lines. Snapchat wouldn’t have the filter that puts your face on a dancing hot dog or on a piece of broccoli.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Without filters, social media would be much less vibrant. They boost the entertainment value of social media and help social media users post pictures that they feel more confident in. Even though some of them make you more conventionally attractive, they are not the cause of society holding those values—and therefore, face filters should not be banned.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Filters make social media more interesting and engaging. Many students, like senior Certitude Lembion, think that social media would not be the same without them. “I don’t think they should necessarily be banned because they are part of the fun of social media,” Lembion said. “If they are banned, then it will make social media a lot less fun for people who just use it as a part of entertainment and enjoyment.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Face filters often make very subtle changes to one’s appearance, whether it's slightly lightening their skin, drawing out their lashes, or slimming down their nose. Many are concerned about the mental health effects of comparing oneself to an even slightly filtered picture as it may enforce unrealistic beauty standards. In response to these claims, however, many social media companies have recently added a new feature that indicates whether or not someone is using a filter, which makes it much harder for people to compare themselves to the people in edited photos.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lembion continued, “[We should be] saying that it’s ok to use filters as long as you disclose it and you make sure that those who look up to you know that this isn’t real life; it’s just for social media.” Even though pictures are being edited, we should be more transparent about when filters are being used instead of banning them outright.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It is unfair to place all of the blame for unfair beauty standards on filters. In the cosmetics and fashion industries, in Hollywood, and in magazine and television advertisements, there is constant pressure to look a certain way: skinny, tan, clear skin, white teeth, big lips, and a small nose. These establishments use heavily edited pictures to advertise their products and profit off of the insecurities that they themselves hammer into consumers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Gelila Isayas agrees that filters are not the main culprit. “If you aren’t content with how you look regarding your face, the blame should not be completely towards filters,” Isayas said. “Nowadays, there’s skin care and makeup for those who wish to enhance or fix their features.” While these unattainable beauty standards should not exist, filters are only a part of this system, and they are not the cause of these insecurities. Removing them won’t fix anything.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">More often, people use filters as a convenient method to hide everyday blemishes. If someone wants to hide their eye bags one morning, they have the option to use a filter and take a quick selfie without having to worry about how they look. Without filters, people would turn towards makeup. Filters, at least, would save time.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“I think banning filters isn’t really the right thing to do,” Lembion said. “Instead we should be educating people and making sure that they know that what’s on social media isn’t exactly real.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Filters should be an option for the people who want them. While filters on social media are far from perfect, they are not the root of the problem. If filters are reworked and regulated to be more inclusive for all people, they would not contribute to unfair beauty standards. Banning them, however, is not the solution.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Considering the current world atmosphere, many people would welcome any excuse for a harmless distraction with open arms. If filters can offer them even just a couple seconds of amusement, then why would we take that away from them? Everyone can use a bit of fun and positivity in their lives.</span></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>CON</strong></h3><p>They have negative impacts on mental health and discriminate against people of color.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33144"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Online class is exhausting. As soon as it ends, all I want to do is scroll through TikTok and watch kids dancing to songs and having fun. I think they look great, but I don’t see past the filters that hide the smallest hint of a pimple, that make their eyes just that much bigger, their cheeks just that much thinner. “Wow,” I think, “They look so much prettier than I do.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I’m not alone—over 1 billion people have downloaded TikTok. When we use the in-app camera to film a short video, a featured “beauty filter” button can be tempting. It makes such tiny changes that the effects are hardly noticeable until you turn it off—but those small tweaks can sink deep into people’s minds, rooting themselves and creating tangible harm. Social media companies should stop offering filters that change the ways our faces look to protect our mental well-being.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">These face-altering filters can lead to serious mental health problems such as low self-esteem. A 2015 study from the International Journal of Eating Disorders found that girls who manipulated photos before sharing them onto social media were significantly more likely to have body image or eating issues. Granted, this study included outside editing as well as filters, but filters are the most convenient route. External editing requires navigating between multiple apps, learning new software, returning to your social media app, and posting. For most people, this is too much effort to put into a single post—making filters the predominant culprit.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Early this year, an analysis from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (AAFPRS) found that the number of plastic surgeries rose by 6 percent between 2018 and 2019. Seventy-two percent of surgeons and practitioners affiliated with AAFPRS reported that they saw patients who wanted procedures in order to look better for selfies. Even if filters were not the direct cause of this statistic, they have contributed to today’s selfie culture.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Filters don’t cause body dysmorphia, but they are known to worsen it. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), more commonly known as body dysmorphia, is a mental illness related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). People with BDD hate a part or parts of their bodies. They develop a conviction that they are hideous and that everyone around them thinks so too. Filters can affirm this misconception.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Stephanie Woodrow, an OCD specialist, says that looking at filtered pictures of ourselves for too long can be damaging. “Our perception of what’s real is being completely altered,” she explained. “If we’re not receiving the message of what’s actually real, then we’re looking at ourselves in the mirror without filters, and we’re seeing nothing but flaws.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For people with body dysmorphia, the thought that they have to change can be so intense that they can lose a sense of what they actually look like. Filters can cause that perception of reality to break down even further.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“You see that filtered version of yourself, and you try your hardest to attain it, but realistically, you can’t,” senior Maya Guise said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Of course, every person who has body dysmorphia has a different experience, and some might not be affected by filters. But for others, filtered faces can become all-consuming and harmful. Social media companies need to realize this and stop offering filters.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So-called “beauty” filters do a few things reliably—they lighten your skin, make your eyes bigger, and make your face thinner. When filters labeled “beauty” change all features into those associated with white people, it can send a message to people of color that they aren’t pretty enough. Guise noted, “A lot of these filters are very eurocentric. They make your nose smaller; they make your skin lighter.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sophomore Bella Graham agrees. “They create an idea that everyone has to be perfect and look a certain type of way,” Graham said. That “certain type of way?” White. Social media should be a place where everyone can feel beautiful, regardless of whether their features happen to match the white ideal. Unfortunately, this is not always the reality.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While some filters openly change how your face looks, some hide their shifting of facial features until the damage is done. While it might seem like someone is just having fun, seemingly inconspicuous filters could be changing a user’s face while they are distracted by the adorable animal or funny joke on top. For example, a filter that puts cute dog ears on your smiling visage might simultaneously ensure that your face stays slim. Even though we know that dogs aren’t the new beauty standard, the tweaks that are made underneath the graphics can still influence our subconscious.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Face filters exacerbate body dysmorphia and perpetuate unrealistic beauty standards. Therefore, social media companies must stop offering them.</span></p>	33146
32870	The U.S. must take a leaf out of other developed countries' books and switch to universal healthcare	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If there's one benefit of coronavirus on the United States' healthcare system, it's that it has exposed the system's flaws. Notably, not everyone has health insurance, and those who aren't covered play a large role in spreading the virus. The U.S. must make the switch to universal healthcare in order to avoid similar situations in the future.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32869"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The United States is the only developed country without universal healthcare. Its system instead consists of a mix of private insurance and public coverage. The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 under President Obama's administration, </span><a href="https://international.commonwealthfund.org/countries/united_states/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">placed</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> shared responsibility on the government, employers and individuals to ensure that everyone has access to high quality and affordable health insurance.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Unfortunately, there are still Americans without health insurance. According to </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-267.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">data</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> collected in 2018 by the U.S. Census Bureau, "8.5 percent of people, or 27.5 million, did not have health insurance at any point during the year." Because doctor's bills are so expensive, many people without coverage wait until a health problem has become extremely serious before going to see a professional.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the case of COVID-19, this has disastrous consequences on the health of the general public. People without health insurance who have been infected by the coronavirus may continue to go out, buy groceries and spread the virus, avoiding testing or going to a doctor or hospital until their symptoms become too big a problem to ignore.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nancy Ross, an intensive care unit (ICU) nurse at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md., says that most of the patients whom she sees for COVID-19 have pre-existing conditions, such as high blood pressure or respiratory disorders, that increase the severity of their cases. Ross states that she often doesn't see these patients until their situation has become dire. One reason for this could be that patients without healthcare are hesitant to come into the hospital even for regular preventative treatments. The easiest way to put an end to this issue is to ensure that all Americans have comprehensive, affordable healthcare.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One option is a single-payer system, in which the government provides healthcare. Many developed countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada and Sweden, use this system. But according to </span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2019/universal-health-coverage-eight-countries" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">The Commonwealth Fund</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a private American organization dedicated to promoting a better healthcare system, their systems differ from those that have been proposed in Congress before.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are two major differences. The first is that in most foreign countries with single-payer systems, patients share part of the cost for most services. The second is that the suggested American plans would give everyone coverage for many services (dental, vision, long-term care, etc.) as opposed to just physician and hospital expenses.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, single-payer plans are extremely expensive for governments, so the United States would have to raise taxes a lot to effectively implement them. The expensiveness of health insurance bars many people from purchasing it in the first place. Thus, it does not make sense to raise taxes and require people to pay more in order to ensure everyone gets it.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Another option is to establish a system of private health care companies for Americans to choose from, like in Switzerland and the Netherlands, where citizens are required to purchase a healthcare plan or else they face a fine. "The Dutch choose between plans offered on a national marketplace, while the Swiss shop on regional marketplaces," wrote The Commonwealth Fund. This option, while still more expensive than not buying any health insurance, gives citizens more freedom in choosing what they want covered and how much they're willing to pay.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For now, however, we must stick together and stay at home as much as possible until instructed otherwise. "It's a devastating virus, and I hope people will remain patient with leaders," Ross says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There is no perfect solution to the healthcare problem, but the coronavirus pandemic has shown us that what we're doing right now isn't working. Switching to universal healthcare will make managing public health crises much easier, and will make doctor's visits a feasible option for everyone even in times where there isn't an outbreak. It's unacceptable that there are people afraid to get tested for COVID-19 because they can't afford to, and universal healthcare presents the most viable solution to the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32869
33538	The addition of free pads in Blair bathrooms is crucial to making menstrual hygiene accessible and helping the community	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33537"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There are a lot of changes that’ve been made at Blair this year. There are the obvious ones, such as the faces obscured behind masks, socially distanced desks, and gargantuan jugs of hand sanitizer in every classroom. However, there is another subtler, yet just as important change -- free pads provided in the bathrooms.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The pads were provided through Farzaneh Nabavian, the Parent Community Coordinator at Blair. The process started with a vision from the administration and some students to provide free and accessible menstrual hygiene for the school.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Throughout quarantine and the start of the school year, different people and organizations in the community grouped together to donate pads to the school. As Nabavian notes, the push to make the vision a reality was made possible through the kindness and hard work of many different people. “The whole thing was a collaborative effort… We actually took that vision and we made it free and available at the school,” Nabavian says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When the school year started, the pads were provided first as a test run. Seeing as the students have been respecting the resources, Nabavian plans to make this a permanent feature in the Blair bathrooms. With over 6,000 pads being donated over quarantine, as well as donations from staff and community members, implementing this change permanently is definitely plausible -- “we don’t think we’re ever going to run out,” Nabavian notes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The implementation of free pads in the bathrooms was also thanks to recent pushes in legislation and student advocacy. Across MCPS, different student advocacy groups have pushed Montgomery County and Maryland legislators to pass laws that would require schools to provide free or easily-accessible menstrual hygiene products in bathrooms for students.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the past few years, this legislation has been a key part of campaigns for those running for Student Member of the Board (SMOB). The current SMOB, Hana O’Looney, recently successfully pushed for legislation that would require MCPS schools to provide free menstrual hygiene products for students, </span><a href="https://www.capitalgazette.com/politics/ac-cn-menstrual-products-elfreth-20210211-20210212-5uylgup3qzab7nfkkyspc2n25q-story.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">citing that the issue is directly connected to quality of education</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. “It only follows logic that when menstruating students don’t have access to pads or tampons, we are going to miss class. The issue of access to menstrual hygiene products in schools is a clear issue of access to education,” O’Looney said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At Blair, the Young Democrats Club has worked in previous years to lobby and write to Maryland officials in positions of power for similar legislation. Sophomore Marie Spirtas, the current president of Young Democrats Club, emphasizes the added importance of having easy access to menstrual hygiene products in school while in a pandemic. “Especially now due to COVID, I don’t think we need extra people in the nurse’s office just to get pads and tampons,” Spirtas says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Spirtas also mentions that the main opposition to this kind of legislation is the fear that the products will be misused, and that this would ultimately lead to a lot of expenses piling up. However, as of right now, students have been respecting the provided products and resources, and a lot of students feel that the addition is purely beneficial.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Fiona Vicary, one of the co-presidents of the Girl Up club at Blair, views the change as crucial and long overdue. “Public restrooms have [menstrual hygiene products], so I definitely think it should have happened a while ago,” Vicary says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Furthermore, on a personal level for a lot of people with periods, not having a menstrual hygiene product when you need it is never a simple matter. As freshman Nikhita Bhatt puts it, being unable to access a pad or tampon easily in public can cause immediate panic and stress. “When [my friends and classmates] don’t have a pad, it’s like a big deal,” Bhatt says. Having free pads in the Blair bathrooms helps alleviate this stress and work toward eliminating this common problem.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Vicary also notes that having accessible menstrual hygiene products is key toward pushing for more gender equity. She, along with the rest of Girl Up, aim to promote fundraising to continue the efforts that are being made. “It’s something we can do for our school, which is awesome,” Vicary says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">That said, it’s important to note that while this is definitely a step forward, the discussion around menstrual hygiene (as well as just menstrual-related topics in general) is still filled with stigma. Many people with periods are uncomfortable with talking about it, and while this is partly a matter of personal privacy, it is also partially caused by the negative light society and the community sheds on periods.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For example, many people with periods feel the need to hide their pads and tampons when they have to change them at school. While some cite that they simply prefer to keep the matter private, others feel ashamed or scared at the thought of others knowing that they are on their period.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In fact, this isn’t just the case with students -- the discomfort surrounding menstruation is so widespread that there is a name for it: period stigma.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-period-stigma-5116231" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to an article from Verywell Mind</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, period stigma is “a broad term for the discrimination faced by people who menstruate.” In many different cultures, periods are viewed as shameful and taboo, and can lead to lowered self-esteem and confidence.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Period stigma manifests in many different ways. This can be something outright, like jokes about Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) or cultural exclusion of people who are menstruating. However, a lack of free or affordable menstrual hygiene products also contributes to the stigma and perpetuates the culture of pretending periods simply don’t exist.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Along with the shame surrounding menstruation, there is also the added economic hindrance of paying large amounts of money for pads and tampons. </span><a href="https://gritdaily.com/for-some-women-the-cost-of-menstruation-is-period-poverty/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to an article from Grit Daily</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, people with periods spend an average of $60 per year on menstrual hygiene products. Since pads and tampons are necessities for people with periods, companies can increase their prices and still guarantee that people will continue to purchase them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Because of this, menstrual hygiene products are often considered luxury items due to their high cost, and many countries impose a sales tax on these products (</span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tampon-tax-4774993" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">colloquially termed the “tampon tax”</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">). However, these high costs place heavy burdens on low-income families and only exacerbate wealth disparities. This makes it even more important for menstrual hygiene products to be provided at schools for free.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Over the past few decades, society has come a long way in empowering women and encouraging them to make their voices heard. That said, the stigma surrounding menstruation remains a constant presence in our lives. And while it may seem small, Blair’s addition of pads to the bathrooms is a crucial step in reducing period stigma and making the discussion around menstruation more inclusive and less stigmatized.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Note from Ms. Nabavian: Please don’t place other menstrual hygiene products in the bathrooms. This is a safety concern, as the products need to be closely monitored and controlled by the school.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p>	33537
32329	Blazers put dedication into their fall outfits	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the weather grows colder, it becomes more of a necessity to bundle up. Students like senior Emma Celine Bardeson and junior Rosie Thrills take “bundling up” to a whole new level. They take inspiration from the fall weather, Instagram fashion accounts and their peers to incorporate new styles into their everyday outfits.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Having an eye for fashion doesn't come naturally but is learned through observation and practice. According to Bardeson, fashion is all about taking inspiration from the people around you. “I always thought about clothes being something that you just wore, like a one-and-done thing. Then I started seeing a lot of people would dress stylishly, and I started having an eye for it,” Bardeson says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32327"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As Thrills puts it, “art never comes easily,” one must put time and effort into finding the right style. Both Bardeson and Thrills find that the most important part of fashion is to feel comfortable and empowered in what they are wearing. They use fashion as an outlet to express their art form. “When you look good, you feel good. Your clothing should express yourself and make yourself feel confident,” notes Thrills.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Putting outfits together requires endless hours in clothing stores, looking through the clothing and trying on multiple pieces that may or may not match. It’s valuable to have a unique style and an idea of how to represent that through your clothing. “I think it's important to be authentic to yourself. You can have people that you admire and like their style. But with everything you do, it should be unique to what you like,” Bardeson comments.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ever since Thrills was little, she has attended to sewing and creating her own outfits, “after my mom taught me how to sew when I was younger, I’ve been sewing outfits for myself ever since,” Thrills explains. She takes inspiration off of sewing Instagram accounts and outfits she sees around her. “If I see a piece of clothing I like, I always go home and try to recreate it in my own way,” Thrills says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Thrills isn't the only one that creates her outfits from scratch. Bardeson picked up sewing shortly after Thrills introduced it to her. Ever since then, the most common place to find Bardeson is in the fashion room at Blair. “I try to sew as much as possible,” says Bardeson. “Now that I think about it, I actually made the top I’m wearing right now,” Bardeson explains as she points to her lacy white tank top.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Thrills found her own style through Instagram fashion accounts, her fashionable friends and thrift shopping. “Everything thrifted is my thing. When I was little I would spend tons of time in the thrift store with my mom and eventually I found my own taste in clothes,” Thrills says. As for Bardeson, she took her inspiration from fashion prediction articles to stay ahead of upcoming fashion trends. “I read a lot about fashion predictions because I want to be able to use those for my own inspiration for the future,” Bardeson says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Now that it's Autumn, Bardeson is working on incorporating more Fall-themed colors in her outfits. “In the past I’ve never liked colors like orange and fall colors, but this year I'm doing something different and trying to incorporate them in my outfits more often,” Bardeson says. The fall weather also calls for warmer clothing. Luckily for Thrills, dressing for the cold is her favorite style. She enjoys layering pieces on top of each other. “You have to wear a lot more layers like turtlenecks and leggings under your pants. Tight pieces over long sleeved shirts can be styled really well as well,” Thrills explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Bardeson also plays around with layering her clothing. “I want to work more with prints and patterns. Layering something patterned with a solid color looks really nice in my opinion,” Bardeson says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Autumn brings new ideas, inspiration and new clothing designs to fashion. For Blair students, it also brings a new perspective on what outfits they put together.&nbsp;</span></p>	32327
33074	At today's Board meeting, MCPS moved to an optional pass/fail grading system due to the impact of COVID-19 on schools	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS will allow high schoolers to choose how their second semester grades appear on their transcript, the Board of Education declared in a 7-1 vote today. Students can opt for their transcript to reflect a “pass” or one letter grade higher than what they received in the third quarter. A COVID-19 marker will also be added to all transcripts for the second semester.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The decision follows the county’s April 19 move to a pass/incomplete grading scale for the fourth quarter. The county has not yet announced the grade calculation procedure for students who earn an “incomplete” for the fourth marking period, but they are determining what credit recovery options will be available, including summer learning.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though MCPS schools will not reopen for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year, the semester will end as scheduled with seniors released on May 22 and all students released on June 15.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS’ original options for second semester grades included universal pass/incomplete, using the third marking period letter grade, reporting one letter grade higher than the third quarter grade, and allowing students to choose between a pass/incomplete and their third quarter grade.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Board members saw the chosen option as a balance between the latter two. “I genuinely do think [offering choice] is the compromise,” Nate Tinbite, the Student Member of the Board, said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">All grade calculations are currently predicated on the assumption that a student passes the fourth quarter. To do so, a student must meet at least two of the following guidelines, which MCPS released on May 3: assignment completion, understanding of concepts/skills, consistent engagement, and the teacher’s professional judgement.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Board’s decision factored in staff, student, and parent feedback, as well as a consideration of known inequities in student access to technology and parental assistance. Board members had received thousands of emails from stakeholders prior to the meeting, with Tinbite alone receiving over 6,500 messages from students.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many BOE members said a system allowing for choice would provide a more equitable evaluation of student performance during unprecedented times. “The combination of giving students the choice between the pass and the grade… was sort of an amendment to the best of two options,” Rebecca Smondrowski (District 2) said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Attesting to his preference for choice, Tinbite expressed concerns about how colleges would view a student with a pass on their transcript instead of a letter grade. “Most colleges filter through their applications on a regional basis,” he said. Tinbite added that if MCPS forced students to report a “pass” while students from neighboring counties had letter grades, colleges may “unconsciously favor” students with grades. Under the choice system, college-bound MCPS students can choose to report a letter grade.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The one dissenting member, Judith Docca (District 1), cited reservations about increasing the burden on teachers. “I don’t want teachers to have extra duties in determining, ‘Oh, this student [gets] a pass; this student [gets] a grade,’” Docca said. She instead supported a system in which every MCPS student would receive a final semester grade one letter higher than what they earned in the third quarter.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Other board members believed that Docca’s preferred system would give students grades that they did not necessarily earn. “I could not see myself supporting [one letter higher than from the third quarter],” Jeanette Dixon (At-Large) said. “I thought it was, in some ways, grade inflation.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Prior to the decision, Board President Shebra Evans (District 4) requested that the MCPS Office of Shared Accountability conduct a comparative analysis following the meeting to make Board members aware of any unforeseen outcomes that may negatively impact students.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maria Navarro, MCPS Chief Academic Officer, also presented recommendations to the Board for elementary and middle school final grades. For students in grades 2-5, Navarro suggested that a student’s final grade be the average of their grades in the first three marking periods. The BOE unanimously approved Navarro’s recommendation. The Board also instructed Superintendent Jack Smith to develop guidelines for middle school that would yield a final grade equal to or higher than a student’s average from the first three quarters.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Final grades for classes providing high school credit that are offered in middle school will be calculated in the same way as all other high school courses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">No changes were suggested for kindergarten and the first grade, as Navarro said that current grading metrics only evaluate proficiency for advancing into the next grade.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition to the grading system, the school board discussed other relevant programs. Between March 16, when schools closed, and May 8, MCPS has distributed 1.7 million meals, 80,000 Chromebooks to students and staff members, and 6,000 personal WiFi networks, according to Deputy Superintendent Monifa McKnight.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Board also unanimously approved a course on LGBTQ+ studies, which will pilot at 10 MCPS high schools. Tinbite said that this pilot course is one of the first in the country.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Prayag Gordy and Sarah Schiffgens contributed reporting.</em></p>	33073
31502	A wide variety of students joined intramural soccer in its second year at Blair	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students rush into Allie Coyle's class, hurriedly taking their seats, chairs squeaking against the floor as they prepare for class. They know if they are absent they won't be able play in their intramural soccer game at lunch. The daily lunch games are incentives for many students to go to class and are something to look forward to in the morning. Intramural soccer is for all skill levels and has different levels of competition for students who are looking to have fun and play serious.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The league is run by Coyle, a science teacher and assistant boys soccer coach, and Rita Boulé, Blair's athletics director. They supervise the games, organize information meetings and recruit players. Employees from Rec-Zone also help out with the league by refereeing the games. Coyle loves managing the league because she gets to know the kids better and sees a spike in her class attendance when the season starts. "I definitely saw a big spike in attendance. It also gives me a chance to get to know the kids in a different way and I think that's really strong," Coyle says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31501"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is the second year Blair has held an intramural soccer league. The league consists of 15 teams with nine players on each. Seven to eight teams each play a ten to 15 minute game in the gymnasium during lunch. The players are mostly students from the ESOL program, but there are other teams and students that are involved, giving the league a large variety of students. Most of the kids already know how to play soccer and many of them are on the soccer team at Blair. "Junior Gael Sullivan is another player in the league from the varsity soccer team who really enjoyed the pace of the games and the competition. "The competition is fun. Everyone is there to win but also have fun. The quick pace of the games is exhilarating and the atmosphere from the crowd really makes for a fun time," Sullivan said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The games even gather crowds during lunch, giving the league a more intense atmosphere. Junior Hector Cruz Santos likes having the crowd even if he gets heckled. "I enjoyed the presence of the crowd a lot. It was funny when they would make fun of a players mistakes. One time I missed an easy goal and got laughed at but it was all fun and games," Santos says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After the regular season, there were single elimination playoffs. Santos' team only lost one game in the regular season and went on to win the championship for period five lunch. He attributes most of their success to their ability to work together. "I think we won all the games including the finals because of teamwork. When we played as a team we looked good and were able to win a lot of games," Santos says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The games got very competitive at times, but for the most part they are just for fun. The solid competition intensifies the games and encourages players to try harder. More information can be provided by Coyle or Boulé about the next season of intramural soccer. Players will be working on their game to prepare for next fall where they will compete to win the intramural soccer championship.</span></p>	31501
32389	A close examination of humanity's best creation	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If you haven't been sleeping under a rock, you've heard the legend of the Popeyes chicken sandwich. When it first came into existence, the world devolved into chaos. Well not really, but it was a big deal. Lines were through the door, and people were rioting just to get a taste. It's funny, really, that a fast-food place that offers such a simple product caused both a nationwide crisis, but also ignited a marketing war between giant chain restaurants.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All this online chatter piqued my interest. So, once the sandwich was back in stock, I grabbed myself a couple of sandwiches. And I can only say one thing: I'm sorry for all of those vegetarians and vegans out there. I mean, I admire your commitment to doing what you do, but you will be missing out. Sorry.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32388"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Let me tell you about this sandwich using assorted terms that I have heard on Food Network. It is very balanced in its flavors. It is salty and savory, but neither of those flavors overpowers the other. The dish is quite moist. Sorry if that word makes you uncomfortable, but it really is moist, which gives it a great mouthfeel.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Those folks at Popeyes give out a very good, solid chunk of meat. The meatiness really serves as a reminder that this is a chicken sandwich, and not a sandwich with some chicken in it. The sandwich is slathered with mayonnaise. Full disclosure, I adore the delightful, eggy condiment, but even if I didn't like it, this dish greatly benefited from it being included. The creaminess gives the taste buds another flavor to focus on, one which plays well off of the crunchy texture and savory flavor of the chicken. By including pickles, the trifecta of wonderful tastes is completed. Yay.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Now I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the </span><a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/man-fatally-stabbed-popeyes-chicken-sandwich-police-say-oxon-hill-prince-georges-county-maryland/29697779#" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">fatal stabbing</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that took place in Oxon Hill, Md. This was of course a tragedy, and I would never ever suggest that anyone kill anybody else over something so trivial and temporary. So if you are reading this, please do not kill or injure anyone over a sandwich. Yes it is good, no it is not worth dying over. I see this sandwich as a way for us as a people to unite behind an amazing thing, and not harm each other or bring each other down. Let us celebrate humanity's ultimate achievement together. Let's all join together to love that chicken from Popeyes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Up until this point, I have been singing the praises of the Popeyes chicken sandwich. But, my dear reader, the Chick-fil-a sandwich will make do. It's fine. It's edible. Quite tasty, actually. But it cannot and does not hold a candle to the masterpiece which is the Popeyes chicken sandwich. Da Vinci is rolling in his grave, wishing that he had been the one to invent this modern-day Mona Lisa. Ladies and Gentlemen, get yourself some of this.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Don't be on the wrong side of history, the side that never believed in the little chicken sandwich that could. I love you, Popeyes' chicken sandwich.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32388
32768	The future of senior activities is unknown right now	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The status of Blair seniors' end-of-year activities, including prom, the last day of school and graduation, is largely unknown because of the </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/publicinfo/community/school-year-2019-2020/coronavirus-update-20200313.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">closure</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of all Maryland public schools for two weeks due to COVID-19. As of March 13, all three are scheduled to continue as intended, but developments in Montgomery County or state policy regarding the coronavirus could change the plans, Principal Renay Johnson said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The junior and senior prom is currently scheduled for Saturday, May 16. The senior class' graduation ceremony is scheduled to be held on Monday, June 1 at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As part of a series of actions to limit the spread of COVID-19, Gov. Larry Hogan announced on March 12 that mass gatherings of more than 250 people are banned statewide. If Maryland's state of emergency is not lifted by the end of the school year, prom and graduation will not proceed as planned.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Plans for graduation also depend on the status of UMBC's campus. "We have a June 1 graduation. We've already contracted with the venue. UMBC closed, so if they don't reopen and they don't let us on campus, then [it will be canceled]," Johnson said. Although Blair has not developed a contingency plan in case of a cancellation, Johnson intends to hold the ceremony on an alternate date. "Every parent waits 13 years to see their youngster graduate, so ideally, we would do it in July if we needed to," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Right now, the seniors' last day of school, scheduled for May 22, is not projected to change regardless of the COVID-19 closure. In past years, despite many snow days, seniors have always ended school during the second-to-last week of May. "In my experience, the seniors' last day has never changed. One year, with Snowmageddon, we were out forever, and the seniors still got out on May 25," Johnson said, referring to the 2010 </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/02/04/ten-years-later-enormity-snowmaggedon-is-still-difficult-comprehend/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">storm</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> that forced Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) to close schools for well over a week.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Spring break is also scheduled to occur as planned. Although the state has recommended that public schools use the break to make up days from the two-week closure, MCPS Superintendent Jack Smith has not made any plans to follow through with the suggestion. "According to MCPS, they have not, and at this time don't plan to, take away our spring break days," Johsnon said. "That's for a number of reasons, one of which is that a lot of parents are still traveling."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Johnson and other Blair administrators are continually looking to the county and state for developments. In the meantime, Johnson urged students to exercise precautionary behavior. "During this really scary time, just have some restraint," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">UPDATE (3/16/20, 7:50 p.m.): In a press conference on March 16, Maryland State School Superintendent Karen Salmon announced that school closures may last beyond the initial two-week period, as per new Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance. The CDC </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/considerations-for-school-closure.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">said</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> a longer closure of eight to 20 weeks will have a higher impact on the effort to decrease the spread of COVID-19. Cheryl Bost, president of the Maryland State Education Association, Maryland's primary teachers' union, said closing schools for the rest of the year is "on the table." </span>“The most important thing right now is to follow the guidance of public health officials to limit and ultimately stop the spread of this virus,” she <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-school-shutdown-20200316-d2a7vfpw2rc7bbmrk5rhjubque-story.html" target="_blank">said</a>. Right now, it is unclear how the potential for a longer closure will affect the year-end schedule at Blair and around MCPS.</p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is a fluid story and updates will be added when available.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p>	32767
31947	The top three picks are locked in but the rest of the lottery is undecided	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This year's draft is one of the most top heavy in recent years with three potential superstars projected to go in the top five picks. After these top picks, many question marks remain. There are many prospects who potential but were riddled with injuries and didn't see the floor much in college, meaning they are unlikely to go in the lottery. Here are my predictions for the top 10 picks of the 2019 NBA draft.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1. Zion Williamson, New Orleans </strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Williamson is the clear number one pick in this draft. He had the most hype around him coming out of high school, but there were questions on whether or not he could compete at the collegiate level. Luckily for Duke, he showed that he can dominate the collegiate level and use his elite athleticism to put up big numbers against just about anyone.Williamson averaged 22 points, 9 rebounds and 2 assists per game and although he had a few injury problems during the season, he was able to come back and perform at his best in March. Zion is the perfect fit for the Pelicans seeing that Anthony Davis will likely be traded this offseason.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: Lebron James</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31946"></div><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2. Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Morant is the top point guard in this draft and is exactly who the Grizzlies need to reboot their team's success. He has elite court vision, a good shot and is able to score off the dribble well. There were many questions about how good Morant really was heading into March Madness because of the competition he had been playing all season. However, Morant proved everyone wrong when he tallied a 17 point triple double along with 16 assists against a well rounded Marquette team in the first round. This game shot his draft stock all the way to a top 3 pick. As Mike Conley gets older, Memphis' need for a point guard becomes more urgent and Morant is just the player to fill that role. </span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: Russell Westbrook</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">3. RJ Barrett, New York Knicks</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">RJ Barrett was another top prospect coming out of high school, and helped Zion Williamson and Duke dominate the college game all season. Although RJ was in the shadow of Zion for most of the season he showed he could step up when Williamson got hurt. Barrett has elite size and athleticism, great ball handling and court vision for his size, and has shown he can score the ball with ease. Although the Knicks would have preferred to pick Williamson, RJ is the next best thing.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: Ben Simmons</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">4.&nbsp;Deandre Hunter, LA Lakers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hunter is a great two way player who can lockdown elite scorers, and when he gets hot, nobody can stop this 6'7" forward. Hunter played his best game in the NCAA Championship scoring 27 points and carrying the Cavaliers to their first title. Hunter would also be able to take some pressure of Lebron with his shot making and his defense, making him a solid pick for the Lakers.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: Otto Porter Jr.</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">5. Jarrett Culver, Cleveland Cavaliers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Culver made a huge improvement during his two year at Texas Tech. He went from a role player to their number one option, and leading them to the NCAA Championship. Culver averaged 18 points per game and also showed that he can guard elite players and effect a game on the defensive end just as much as the offensive end. He is the perfect fit for the Cavaliers who are in a rebuild phase and need a go to scorer in their lineup.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: Jimmy Butler</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">6. Cam Reddish, Phoenix Suns</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Reddish was the third option for a dominant Duke team, but still showed flashes of elite play. Although he was inconsistent throughout the season, Reddish is a lethal shooter and has lots of potential with a perfect build for an NBA wing player.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: Paul George</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">7. Darius Garland, Chicago Bulls</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Bulls are in desperate need of a scoring point guard, and Garland looks like he could be their guy. Garland played just five games at Vanderbilt before a season ending knee injury which killed his chances at being a top 5 pick. However, in his short college career, Garland played like an elite point guard showing off great ball control, the ability to create off the dribble, and NBA range shooting.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: Damian Lillard</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">8. Sekou Doumbouya, Atlanta Hawks</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Doumbouya is built on mostly potential. Playing in France's top league he showed huge improvements in his all around offensive skills and his defense. Given time and the right circumstances he could turn into a very good NBA player.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: Giannis Antetokounmpo</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">9. Coby White, Washington Wizards</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With John Wall likely to miss most of the 2019-20 season and the Wizards in the middle of a rebuild, a score first point guard could be a good pick for them. Coby White is a fast pass score first guard who thrives in transition and is developing into a good playmaker.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: John Wall</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31948"></div><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">10. Jaxson Hayes, Atlanta Hawks</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hayes is a freak of nature with insane athleticism making him a great rim protector and defensive big. His basketball skills are still developing, but with his body and athleticism his potential to be an elite big is through the roof.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Player Comparison: DeAndre Jordan</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31946
33271	Former Blazer Tom Brown inducted into the Montgomery County Sports Hall of Fame.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Before Tom Brown was a two-time Super Bowl champion and a Major League Baseball player––and one of less than 70 people to have ever played both professional football and baseball––he was a Blazer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brown, one of this year’s inductees into the Montgomery County Sports Hall of Fame, played football, baseball, and basketball for Blair before graduating in 1958.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33270"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Tom Brown’s son, Brad Brown, says that his father was competitive from an early age. “Growing up [in] Silver Spring, [he] came from a very athletic background,” he says. “My dad always [tells me] he played [sports] with kids that were two or three years older than him because that’s what his older brother Richard was.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At Blair, Brown was a gifted athlete and excelled at the three sports he played year-round. In particular, Brown’s talent in football led to interest from colleges. However, Brown insisted on playing baseball at the next level. “My dad loved baseball [more] than any other sport,” Brad Brown says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When Brown visited the University of Maryland in 1958, he leveled with head football coach Tom Nugent. “[My dad] said ‘Listen, I want to play baseball too,’” Brad Brown says, “and the coach [went] ‘no… we want you to focus on one sport.’” That’s when Tom Brown’s father stepped in and told Nugent it was either allow him to play both or they would look at other schools. Nugent realized he didn’t have a choice; he agreed to let Brown play both football and baseball on the condition that he earn a starting position on the baseball team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During his time at Maryland, Brown enjoyed success on the gridiron and the diamond; he earned All-American and All-Conference honors playing both football and baseball. In his senior season in 1963, Brown sported an impressive .449 batting average, earning him an offer to play for the Washington Senators right out of college. That same year, Brown was drafted 28th overall in the NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers. “My dad had to make that decision of ‘do I go football or baseball?’” Brad Brown says. “He obviously figured that he would have a much longer career in baseball, so he chose baseball.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brown signed a minor league contract in February of 1963. He ended up making the major league team in April, but Brad Brown explains that it wasn’t just athletic skill that led him to get called up.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(23, 43, 77); background-color: rgb(244, 245, 247);">”</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He’s down there in the minor league system and he’s doing real well,” he says, “but it was Fidel Castro that had a huge impact on my dad’s career… The Senators’ first baseman was Cuban and [he went] back to Cuba after the baseball season,” he explains. “The guy got stuck down there and he couldn’t get out. They needed a first baseman… so they go, ‘let's call up Tom Brown.’”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After a year playing at the major league level and a couple of years floating around in the Senators’ minor league system, Vince Lombardi––the legendary football coach and the namesake of the Super Bowl trophy––persuaded Brown to make the switch to football and play for the Green Bay Packers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Under Lombardi, Brown won the first two Super Bowls in NFL history in 1967 and 1968. In the 1968 offseason, Lombardi left Green Bay to become the coach and general manager of Washington’s football franchise and brought Brown with him. Brown would only end up playing a single game with Washington before suffering a season-ending injury and retiring at the end of the season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brown is the only athlete in history to have played for both Washington’s baseball and football franchises.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After retiring, Brown left a mark off the field as well. He created a youth sports camp in Salisbury called Tom Brown’s Rookie League. “My dad wanted to teach kids the fundamentals of baseball, basketball, and football,” Brad Brown says. “He had an impact on these kids. They came from all different backgrounds––married [parents], divorced [parents], white, Black, Catholic. It didn’t matter to my dad. If you wanted to come out and play sports, my dad would love to have you.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brad Brown describes the attitude his dad brought to coaching. “I remember when we were playing youth football and there was a penalty, the referees would go talk to the coaches, [but] my dad [would say]... ‘go talk to my players and let them decide what they want to do.’” Brown continued to coach and oversee the camp for 40 years until he retired in 2015.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In his pursuits off the field, Brown was humble and made a point of passing along his sports wisdom to the next generation.“When he was coaching, he never wanted anyone to say ‘Oh, that’s Tom Brown over there,’” Brad Brown says. “[It] was about the kids.”</span></p>	33270

33014	Giannis Antetokounmpo wins his second consecutive MVP and the Lakers win their 17th NBA Finals in one-of-a-kind NBA season	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After the COVID-19 pandemic brought the NBA season to a halt for nearly four months, the top 22 of 30 teams returned to play at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Fla, otherwise known as "the bubble". After each team played eight regular season games that would be added on top of their original record, the playoff bracket was set.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Here is a quick reaction to the regular season all-NBA honors. I will preface the award reactions by saying it's hard to leave playoff performances to the side, but I will do my best.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All-NBA First Team:</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">James Harden, Houston Rockets</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Giannis Antetekounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (MVP)</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although I predicted Giannis would win back in </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/slightly-too-early-nba-award-predictions-32449/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">December</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, LeBron should have won the MVP. He was the best player on the best team in the league this year. LeBron elevates the Lakers and he truly makes every single player better.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a Wizards fan, I wish I would've seen Bradley Beal on the first team. As an NBA fan, I wish I would've seen him on literally any of the three all-NBA teams. Beal ended second to James Harden in points per game with 30.5 points per game. Granted, he opted out from the bubble and the Wizards were mediocre at best this year.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA All-Rookie First Team:</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies (ROTY)</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kendrick Nunn, Miami Heat</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Eric Paschall, Golden State Warriors</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Zion Williamson, New Orleans Pelicans</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Brandon Clarke, Memphis Grizzlies</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ja Morant was the no-brainer rookie of the year. Morant towered over other rookies in player efficiency rating (PER) and total win shares (tWS). In addition, Memphis had one of the youngest and most inexperienced teams in the league, yet their 2019 second-overall draft pick led them to 9th place in a very competitive Western conference.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kendrick Nunn exploded onto the scene, winning Rookie of the Month in November, December and January, but I would take his teammate Tyler Herro in the second guard spot. A case could be made for Washington's Rui Hachimura replacing Paschall, as Hachimura was the second best scorer on his team, but Paschall had a statistically stronger season.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA All-Defensive First Team:</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Marcus Smart, Boston Celtics</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Giannis Antetekounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks (DPOY)</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With Giannis leading the league in defensive win shares, this win makes sense. I'm glad to see Marcus Smart earn his second consecutive all-defensive first team honors. Honestly, Patrick Beverley or Kyle Lowry could have possibly been more deserving of the second guard spot over Ben Simmons.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">6th Man of the Year: Montrezl Harrell, Los Angeles Clippers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although Lou Williams is the all-time classic sixth man, Harrell has proved himself as one of the best big men in the league, all from outside the starting five. Sometimes I wonder why he doesn't just start over Ivica Zubac. OKC's Dennis Schroder would have also been a fair winner behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Most Improved Player: Brandon Ingram, New Orleans Pelicans</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The race for MIP is always a tough one. In my December prediction, I thought that Charlotte's Devonte' Graham was the clear frontrunner for MIP. I still think his progression from his rookie year to his sophomore year was one of a kind. Miami's Bam Adebayo saw a huge increase in his role in the team. That being said, Brandon Ingram saw an increase in volume after coming to a young New Orleans team. He stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the park.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From James Harden's series-winning block against Oklahoma City, to the Nuggets erasing two consecutive 3-1 deficits, to Duncan Robinson hitting three after three after three, the bubble playoffs were quite the journey. Now, for the reaction of these playoffs.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Conference Quarterfinals</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Boston defeats Philadelphia (4-0)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - With Ben Simmons missing the series and a very young, talented Boston team, this came as no surprise.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Miami defeats Indiana (4-0)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - This was the start of an unexpected NBA Finals Trip for Miami, sweeping the higher-seeded Pacers. Coming into the postseason, T.J. Warren averaged 34.8 points in the last five games of the regular season, but he lit a fire in Jimmy Butler after they got into a shoving match in game 2. Jimmy Butler carried that for the rest of the playoffs.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Milwaukee defeats Orlando (4-1)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - After Orlando's impressive Game 1 win, Milwaukee swept Nikola Vucevic (28 points per game) and the Magic, but looked shaky doing so.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Toronto defeats Brooklyn (4-0)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - Brooklyn was really just a weak team making the playoffs due to their weak conference. That aside, Toronto did more this year than anyone expected.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Denver defeats Utah (4-3) </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">- Donovan Mitchell (36.3 points per game) and Utah won three of the first four games, one of which they won by nearly 30 points. Miraculously, on the back of fantastic performances from Nikola Jokic, Denver won the last three games in order to win the series.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Houston defeats Oklahoma City (4-3)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - This tumultuous series went back and forth, down to the last second. Harden did what Harden does, average about 30 points per game, and Oklahoma City flexed their depth with six players in double figures. Ultimately, Harden's series-winning block sent them to the conference semifinals.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">L.A. Clippers defeat Dallas (4-2)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - Luka Doncic showed why he deserved his All-NBA First Team honors, averaging 31 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 8.7 assists. I wasn't very impressed with Dallas' performance, but they were facing one of the best playoff performers (Kawhi Leonard) and a pretty experienced team in the Clippers.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">L.A. Lakers defeat Portland (4-1)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - Damian Lillard is a playoff demon, there's no denying that, but it's fair to say he slightly underperformed in this series. That being said, LeBron averaged a triple-double and Anthony Davis' defense was able to stunt Jusuf Nurkic's production.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Conference Semifinals</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Boston defeats Toronto (4-3)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - This series showed that Toronto is a force to be reckoned with next year, especially if they can resign Serge Ibaka and Fred VanVleet. Pascal Siakam put out pretty weak performances though, while Boston's young core kept eating and eating.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Miami defeats Milwaukee (4-1)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - Giannis folded. As the league MVP and the leader of your team, there is no planet in which you can sit out of an elimination game. That being said, Milwaukee did win game 4 without him, but if he was able to play, he should have. Miami, though, had a great series and showed off their numerous scoring options.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Denver defeats the L.A. Clippers (4-3)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - Another 3-1 comeback for the Nuggets! Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic proved to the entire league that they are a dangerous team. Clippers stars Paul George and Kawhi Leonard combined for 58 points in Game 6, but the Nuggets simply had a better game. In Game 7, Leonard and George folded under pressure, combining for just 24 points, while Denver's Murray dropped 40.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">L.A. Lakers defeat Houston (4-1)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - After another game 1 loss, the Lakers got in their groove, led by LeBron James who averaged 25.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 2.0 steals and 1.8 blocks. I'm not sure why Houston didn't transition out of their small ball lineup as they faced one of the strongest big man units in the league. As a result, the Lakers ate on the boards and dominated inside.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Conference Finals</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Miami defeats Boston (4-2)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - I know I sound like a broken record, but once again, Miami kept spreading the ball with six players scoring in double figures. I will say, I am thoroughly impressed with Marcus Smart's offensive performance in this series, and him being an extra offensive weapon on Boston is scary.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">L.A. Lakers defeat Denver (4-1)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - We all knew Denver's success would come to an end when they had to face the Lakers. I'm sure fatigue was a factor, as Denver played 14 games before this series (as opposed to L.A.'s 10 games played). To balance Paul Millsap's underwhelming performance, Michael Porter Jr.'s production saw a jump, which is promising for Denver's future.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NBA Finals</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">L.A. Lakers defeat Miami (4-2)</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> - After a somewhat-boring Game 1 and 2, I thought this would be an easy sweep for the Lakers. Thankfully, Miami got in their groove and gave the Lakers a challenge. Game 5 was one of the best Finals games I have watched in my lifetime, from LeBron dropping 40 to Jimmy Butler sitting just 48 seconds all game. I'm excited to see how this young Miami team can keep progressing and, hopefully, keep up the success. Of course, we can't talk about the Finals without talking about LeBron's stellar performance all series, as well as the veterans on the team showing out, such as Rajon Rondo dropping 19 in game 6.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All in all, this NBA season has been unique, to say the least. The league hopes to play a full 82-game regular season with a full postseason and spectators for the 2020-21 season. As it stands, we may not see any NBA basketball until the new year, as </span><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29946010/best-guess-start-next-season-not-2021" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Adam Silver announced in September</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33013
32978	A SCO guide on alleviating aches and pains from sitting in front of a screen all day	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As online school goes into full swing, students and teachers are suffering the health consequences of sitting in front of a screen all day. Complaints of eyes straining, backs hurting, and feeling sore all around are more common than ever. Thus, it’s crucial that everyone takes the time to protect our bodies and minds. Just doing a few exercises and stretches can go a long way, and they can help with both physical pain and mental stress.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Protecting your eyes</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Staring at a screen for a long period causes eye fatigue, eye strain, and a plethora of other problems. </span><a href="https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/computer-vision-syndrome#1" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to </a><a href="https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/computer-vision-syndrome#1" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">WebMD</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, doctors now have a name for this: Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">CVS is caused by a lack of eye movement: when you stare at a screen for a long time, your eyes don’t blink as much, leading to dryness and itchiness. Your eyes tend to follow the same movements constantly (i.e. staring at a teacher’s white board during math class), causing strain on the eye muscles. CVS also leads to headaches, fatigue/exhaustion, and dizziness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One way to give your eyes a break is to follow the 20-20-20 rule, which has been recommended by the </span><a href="https://www.aoa.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">American Optometric Association</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. “For every 20 minutes you spend looking at a digital device or computer screen, you should look at something else that is 20 feet away for a period of 20 seconds,” experts from </span><a href="https://www.nvisioncenters.com/education/20-20-20-rule/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">NVISION Centers write</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are also simpler eye exercises you can do: tracing a figure eight using your eyes, moving your thumb back and forth while focusing on it, or just closing your eyes and applying pressure with your palms.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What about the device itself? Lately, more and more people have invested in blue light glasses, which have lenses that block harmful blue light that come from screens. However, blue light glasses might not be as helpful as they sound. </span><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/do-blue-light-glasses-work#summary" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to an article by Medical News Today</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, we shouldn’t be relying on blue light glasses too much. “Eye doctors suggest that eye fatigue, headaches, and poor sleep may be associated with computer vision syndrome instead of blue light exposure,” Dr. Jessica Caporuscio writes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There isn’t just one single cure for CVS. Alleviating eye strain requires a lifestyle change and making good habits of following these exercises daily. Next time you have a long day of online school ahead of you, try following the 20-20-20 rule a few times or doing a few eye exercises during and in between classes!&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32977"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Protecting your body</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sitting at a desk all day is bound to leave us cramped and sore, and good posture is key here. </span><a href="https://www.scoi.com/services/physical-therapy/importance-good-posture" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to Frank J.

32427	Junior Jordan McAuliff took a stand and slept on a boat for the week to show her commitment to the climate movement.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During the week of Dec. 2, junior Jordan McAuliff left the heat and comfort of her home to spend four nights sleeping on a boat. As a member of the Sunrise Movement,which is led by youth to promote action to combat the climate crisis, McAuliff has been involved in the emerging youth climate movement for a long time and wanted to show her commitment to demanding change.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32420"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“I both wanted to raise awareness about the climate crisis and then also demonstrate my own commitment to doing something about it through an act of personal sacrifice,” McAuliff said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff chose to stay in a boat all week to emphasize how quickly the oceans are rising and the adverse effects the rising ocean levels have had on the environment and world population. On the side of the boat, McAuliff had hung a sign with information about major hurricanes that had occurred recently and another sign that read, “SOS."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32421"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Hurricanes are really important examples of the kind of natural disasters that the climate crisis is making worse. Communities are being really decimated and that's partially an effect of those rising waters. The flooding that comes as a result of that is going to get worse and worse as the ice melts and as the ocean gets warmer,” McAuliff said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The boat has personal symbolism, as well. McAuliff says, “My dad lived on a boat growing up. He became a lifeguard and he really taught me that the people who need help the most are the people who go too far out and that’s symbolic to me of where the world is at now with the climate crisis, where we’re not going to be able to go back and there's not going to be anyone to rescue us.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32422"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From below-freezing weather to homework by lantern light, McAuliff experienced challenges throughout the week. She originally parked the boat in Blair’s parking lot, but was eventually asked to move. McAuliff had to search for a place to legally park the boat that wouldn’t cause disturbance and was close enough to Blair so she could walk to school. The boat was parked in the Woodmoor neighborhood for most of the week.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The boat had no source of heat or insulation, so McAuliff had to find clothing to wear that would keep her warm throughout the night. When McAuliff reached out to Patagonia and told them about the boat, Patagonia sent her high tech gear to keep warm. During the night, McAuliff had to wake up almost every three hours because people were taking shifts staying with her for safety.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32423"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff is glad to have received positive feedback and has seen a lot of support for her actions in the past week. “It was a really good tool to get people engaged who maybe had been interested but hadn’t been involved before. People were really willing to take a step up and take a shift watching over me or lend me stuff. It was an important organizing tool for people around me in the community to see an opportunity to get involved,” said McAuliff.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While McAuliff says she doesn’t plan on sleeping on a boat any time again in the near future, she still has a vision for the climate movement. “There's definitely a time and place for individual action, but the more important thing that we need is communal action. This individual action by me was a call of action to the rest of the community saying join me so that we can organize in the future and we can do this as a large group and really disrupt society in order to demand action.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32424"></div><p><br></p>	32420
32457	The recommended budget includes an increase of $1.2 million from last year	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Dec. 18, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) Superintendent Jack Smith hosted a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5wr2RswVhI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">community</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> forum to present his latest recommendation for the 2021 fiscal year operating budget. The proposed $2.8 billion budget includes a $121,119,258 increase from last year's budget.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The biggest fraction of the increase in the budget comes from an addition of nearly $6.9 million in professional salaries and wages. The majority of the increase is funded through local grants from the county. Last year, county funds totaled $1.7 billion. If the new budget passes through, county funds are expected to rise to $1.8 billion.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In a portion of the conversation moderated by Blair junior Hunter Walterman, Smith discussed why students should care about the operating budget. "As you walk through the halls of your high school with about 3,200 other students every day, the money in that operating budget creates that experience that you have,” he said. “Whether it's in the arts, in the sciences, in languages, in athletics, while you're at school, every single part of your experience is in that operating budget."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/departments/budget/fy2021/FY2021_RecommendedBudget_Complete_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">budget</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, which will be in effect from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, reflects MCPS' top priorities, including expanding access and opportunity for all, creating a safe learning environment and recruiting qualified staff to maintain a competitive edge. According to Deputy Superintendent of Schools Monifa McKnight, the county's goal is to prepare all students to thrive in the future. "'All' is a keyword in this equation. MCPS has a long history of achievement for many of its students, but not all. Data continues to show disparities in academic outcomes for our students of color and students in poverty," McKnight said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32456"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The expected rise in budget is a result of the school system's rapidly increasing student body. Over the past 11 years, MCPS' student population has increased by 25,000. Just this year, the student population rose by 2,600. MCPS' budget per student has also been increasing. In fiscal year 2019, the cost per student was $15,067; in 2020, it rose to $15,435; this year's proposed budget allocates $15,809 per student.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The budget also allocates resources for three new regional International Baccalaureate centers, a specialized team to recruit qualified teachers, an equity and innovation fund, more security staff and a new after-school supervision structure to keep students safe after classes are over. In addition, the plan puts in $14.2 million to open up approximately 82 positions for psychologists, social workers, instructional support teams for English language learners, special education and the extension of prekindergarten programs.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith also hopes to see an expansion of high-school programs. "We're going to expand our aviation program. We're going to expand our computer science program. The Seneca Valley [career readiness] programs will provide many, many more seats for students across the upper part of the county," he said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To make up for the $1.2 million increase, the budget includes a reduction of $5 million for the Employee Benefits Plan. According to Smith's proposal, "in the past three fiscal years, medical and prescription drug claims have continued to increase at a much lower rate than previously anticipated [and] subsidies for employees also have increased, resulting in additional revenue generated in the fund."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Going forward, the Board of Education will host work sessions and public hearings to finalize their recommendation for the 2021 operating budget, which will go through Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich and the County Council. In June, the Board will adopt the official operating budget.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32455

32588	The Blazers fall to the Panthers by a score of 45-39	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (9-2) lost to the Paint Branch Panthers (9-1) in a tough game on Friday night. The Panthers put on an incredible showing offensively and the Blazers were unable to catch up.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Tensions were high as the Panthers started the game by winning the tip-off and scoring seven points within the first 39 seconds. Unstable and caught off guard, the Blazers struggled to make baskets and keep control of the ball during their possessions. Paint Branch made 15 successful steals and pushed Blair to 25 turnovers in the entire game. Blair could not compensate, as their defense could only pull-off nine steals and 18 turnovers.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32587"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the game progressed, Paint Branch continued to make baskets while Blair stayed hot on their heels and maintained their high spirits. While on the bench, junior forward Elise Haverland could be heard loudly cheering her teammates on throughout the entire game. “I think that [spirit] is a really big component of the game. If the entire gym is silent and we’re losing, then everybody is going to be down... If you have somebody from the bench being like, ‘Yeah go! You got it,’ it gives you that much more confidence,” Haverland said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Freshman guard Amelia Martin led the team in aggressive defense with three deflections and pushed Paint Branch to five turnovers over the course of the game. With a two-pointer and subsequent three-pointer by junior guard Kate Hildebrandt, Blair managed to close the score gap to 43-39 by the seventh minute of the fourth quarter. However, lack of offensive success ultimately led to Blair’s defeat. The Panthers made an impressive amount of three-pointers, while Blazers struggled to make lay-ups and lost the ball numerous times as a result of hasty passes. The night ended with a 45-39 defeat for Blair.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite their loss, Blazers acknowledged that the game was fun due to the aggression that both sides put in. Freshman guard Natalie Frost suffered a painful fall at the end of the third quarter, but she returned to the court with even more determination in the fourth quarter. Paint Branch also pushed Hildebrandt to the ground on various occasions. The Panthers were equally passionate, keeping fierce possession of the ball no matter what position they were in. “I think [aggression] impacts the game a lot. Then, everyone is going for the ball -- diving for the ball -- and it makes the refs second guess their calls; it makes it more fun. It’s definitely a good game when it’s aggressive,” Hildebrandt said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game on Tuesday, January 28th against the Sherwood Warriors at 7:15 p.m.&nbsp;</em></p>	32587
33517	Blair remains undefeated after a commanding victory over Northwood	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers (3-0) dominated the Northwood Gladiators (0-3) in the famed “Battle of the Boulevard” matchup with a crushing 30-0 score. Northwood attempted to compete, but Blair’s electric first-half offensive performance and powerful defensive play made it impossible for the Gladiators to stay in the game. Blair now moves to first place in the Montgomery County 4A North Region.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers started off with a bang, scoring a touchdown early on in the first quarter. The domination continued in the second quarter as Blair reached the end zone three more times, twice through the air and once on the ground in drives that were as methodical as they were explosive. The Gladiators relied heavily on their rushing attack, which the Blair defense promptly stuffed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Right as the first half was ending, junior running back Tariq Taylor gained big yards, putting the Blazers at the 40-yard line. Then, junior quarterback Kendell Anderson scrambled his way through the Gladiator’s defensive line, getting the Blazers a first down. Anderson followed up his run by completing a touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Jamal Worrell. Taylor described how seeing his teammates play well lights a fire in him. “After seeing Kendell put on that show, it’s hard not to get pumped up,” Taylor said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Anderson, who started off the second quarter with another touchdown pass, felt especially excited to have such an excellent performance during one of the most important sporting events for the Blair community. “This is my second time doing the ‘Battle of the Boulevard.’ They robbed us last year from playing it, so this year was like a big comeback and it felt really good,” Anderson said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the second half, the Blazers started off with a significant punt return getting them to the 50-yard line. Senior running back Andy Merrill got in a 10-yard run getting the Blazer’s to the 40. Merill immediately followed with a 20-yard run, which was negated by an offside penalty.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Northwood’s defense started to show some fire in the second half, getting their first stop on the Blazers and forcing them to punt. The offense fumbled and recovered, but the Blair defense followed up by getting a tackle in the endzone for a safety.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The game ended relatively quietly in the 4th quarter with both team’s defenses getting good stops. Blair’s defense felt like ending the game in style, sacking the Gladiator’s QB for a loss on one of their last possessions. Senior defensive tackle Antonio Gonzalez credited the show that the Blazers put on today to the team's hard work and the electric crowd. “The stomping, the screaming, we feed off the crowd’s energy, and you see that in our game,” Antonio Gonzalez said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Head Coach Samual Nosoff was also pleased with the defense’s performance. “Our guys on defense, combined with our defensive plan, we’re tough to beat. We make tackles, [and] when we send linebackers on blitzes they’re hard to stop. We’re just an overall sound defense,” Nosoff said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nosoff added that there are always things the team can improve, but those minor flaws aren’t the team’s primary concerns as they look towards the next game. “It’s all about just gameplanning for Paint Branch and exploiting their weaknesses,” Nosoff said. The Blazers will keep that in mind as they play their next away game on Friday, Sept. 24, against the undefeated Paint Branch Panthers at 7:00 pm.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33514
32888	Montgomery County residents stay home while celebrating and minimal increase in new cases within county	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On July 6, Maryland’s daily number of new cases spiked at 540 new cases, an increase of 190 compared to July 1. In the U.S., there has been an increase in new COVID-19 cases since the Fourth of July weekend in at least 40 states. This year, most families celebrated at home instead of following typical Fourth of July tradition.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the nationwide trend of rising pandemic cases, Montgomery County’s daily new case numbers have remained steady at an average of 45 new cases per day since the start of July.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Leading up to Fourth of July celebrations, officials across the nation warned against crowded events like watching fireworks or going to the beach. In her </span><a href="https://youtu.be/pIRZkZY9fSc" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">news conference on June 25</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser asked D.C. residents to stay home during celebrations on Independence Day. “Our strong recommendation is that D.C. residents celebrate the Fourth of July at home or near their home in small gatherings,” Bowser announced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite warnings from officials to stay home and avoid crowded public spaces, many Americans continued celebrating as usual, leading to the rise in national case numbers. While some beaches closed their gates, many remained open to crowd sizes that appeared no different from previous non-pandemic years.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazer Lydia Chan celebrated this Fourth of July at the beach in South Carolina, and noticed that it appeared to look the same as usual years, with high turnout and large crowds in spite of public safety recommendations.&nbsp;﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32887"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chan wore a mask and adhered to social distancing regulations, but noticed that many of the other beachgoers did not. The lack of preventative measures taken worried her. “If I don’t get the coronavirus I’d be lucky,” Chan said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">South Carolina was one of the states that saw an increase in COVID-19 cases after the Fourth of July weekend. In comparison, Maryland has been on a steady decline in new COVID-19 cases since June. Regulations issued by state officials have helped keep case numbers in check within the state.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One action Montgomery County took was cancelling public fireworks displays. On June 24, Dr. Earl Stoddard, Director of Montgomery County’s Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, </span><a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org/montgomery-county-cancels-fourth-of-july-fireworks-displays/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">announced at a media briefing</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that all annual fireworks celebrations would be cancelled. "The Fourth of July is coming up, there will be no public fireworks displays," Stoddard said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This year, Blazers who usually celebrated the Fourth of July with fireworks turned to other forms of celebration. With older siblings coming home from college due to COVID-19 shutdowns, many Blazers celebrated with family gatherings and at-home events.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazer sophomore Katya Shepherd Johnson spent the weekend playing tennis and celebrating at home with her family. “We just played tennis and made burgers and hot dogs on the back porch, no party or celebration stuff or anything,” Shepherd Johnson said. Many other Blazers did the same: staying home with at most a big family dinner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Stoddard also said in his announcement that Montgomery County residents were prohibited from using fireworks privately, in order to prevent accidents or neighborhood gatherings that might lead to increases in COVID-19 cases.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, some Blazers noted that they heard sporadic fireworks going off in their communities throughout the Fourth of July weekend. Blazer sophomore Agata Czaja remarked that there were a large number of communities with private fireworks throughout the weekend. "There were so many [fireworks] in people's neighborhoods actually, like until 1 or 2 a.m.," Czaja said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the moment, these private gatherings have not affected Montgomery County case numbers drastically. While most of the U.S. celebrated with public fireworks and events over the Fourth of July weekend, most Montgomery County citizens and Blazers followed protocol and celebrated at home, keeping COVID-19 under control.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32887
32009	Maryland state legislators didn't have a fiscal plan in mind when they passed the new education act.\r\n.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gov. Larry Hogan addressed county legislators' concerns about funding for Maryland's education plan in his closing speech at the Maryland Association of Counties on Aug. 15. "I know that county leaders have had meetings over the past few days about the major school funding storm that is gathering on the horizon," he said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On May 25, the General Assembly passed The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, an act that implements many of the Kirwan Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education's recommendations for the state. These recommendations propose several funding initiatives to improve Maryland's public education system.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The initiatives include a teacher salary incentive grant program, funding for mental health services coordinators, concentration of poverty grants, special education grants and others. However, the Commission's recommendations require nearly $4 billion per year, which is why Hogan chose not to sign the bill although he did allow it to become law so it went into effect as planned on June 1, 2019. His fiscal concerns have now resurfaced among county officials.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hogan told county leaders that the State General Assembly had hastily rushed through the plan before considering the consequences. "[The legislators] took this action without any regard to funding formulas and with absolutely no plan whatsoever for how any… counties or the state taxpayers could possibly be able to pay for any of it," he said.﻿</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">An analysis by the Maryland Department of Budget and Management showed that implementing all of the Commission's recommendations would cause a fiscal shortfall of $18.7 billion for the state. "The Department estimate[d] Maryland households would each be forced to pay an additional $6,200 more in taxes over the next five years," Hogan's administration said in a press release.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32003"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The bill mandates that $355 million be used to implement the recommendations in fiscal year (FY) 2021, and calls for $370 million in FY 2022. It's possible that up to $130 million more will be used in FY 2022, contingent on revenue made available by implementing the recommendations.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cheryl Bost, President of the Maryland State Education Association, and other Maryland educators were in favor of the bill being passed. "The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future will support teachers with better pay, create more career pathways for our students, and bring high-quality education to every school in every zip code," Bost said. She didn't deny the lack of funding, though.

But the question of how the state plans to fund this new education proposal remains a mystery.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32003
32535	The Blazers (20-2) beat Clarksburg (7-6) 42-24 on Teacher Appreciation Night	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Originally anticipated to be the closest meet of the month, the Blazers' (20-2) wrestling match against the Clarksburg Coyotes (7-6) on Wednesday night was ultimately a sweeping 42-24 win for Blair. The Blazers led in score throughout the full meet, showcasing their unparalleled mental strength built on demanding conditioning in the training room.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Prior to the matches, the team celebrated Teacher Appreciation Night, where each wrestler nominated their favorite teacher and wrote them a grateful letter. Over 30 teachers were present, sharing a collective moment of appreciation with the student athletes. English teacher Carly Moore, nominated by junior Tito Lozano, was surprised to be nominated as a first-year teacher. "It was unexpected but gratifying to have a student feel they got something out of my class and connected with me as a teacher," Moore said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The meet kicked off in the 195-pound weight class, with senior and team captain Elias Chen securing an early lead, 4-0. Sophomore Aaron Vernon from the junior varsity team filled in a gap in the varsity lineup for the 285-pound weight class. Senior and team captain Mervin Mancia pinned his opponent during the second period in the 220-pound weight class, bringing the Blazers up 10-3. Despite a tough fight, female team member and freshman Marryam Funyas was pinned in the first period.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the 120-pound weight class, senior Sideeg Abdulla pinned his opponent within the first minute of the match, boosting the score 16-9. The quick pin also boosted his confidence after matching against two state-ranked wrestlers earlier in the season. "I saw an opportunity when he shot too far out, so I sprawled, moved to the side and did a near side cradle," Abdulla said. "It felt pretty good because it was my first home win of the season."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior and team captain Brian McCaw scored 5 team points in the 113-pound weight due to a technical fall. In the 126-pound weight class, senior Aidan Rogers emerged victorious with more individual points, advancing the score 24-9 in Blair's favor. Sophomore Nikolai Tochilin resisted throughout his match but was ultimately pinned by Clarksburg in the 132-pound weight class.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32529"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the 145-pound weight class, spirits soared as senior Nimesh Fonseka pinned his opponent with 16 seconds left in the match, increasing Blair's lead 30-15. "The guy was really strong and he ankle picked me in the beginning but I worked back up quickly," Fonseka said. "I threw him on the ground and I think he just gave up."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sophomore Junior Kim held out throughout his match, but his opponent scored more individual match points in the 138-pound weight class. In the 152-pound weight class, freshman Nelson Manzoeto scored more individual points over his opponents and brought Blair up 33-18.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the 160-pound weight class, senior Jason Kaplan and his opponent each had a takedown, ending with a tie. Although his opponent was strong, Kaplan won the match during overtime due to mental strength. "We work really hard in that room every single day just so we can be confident in those circumstances," he says. "It came down to the mental side of things and I just wanted it more." His match secured Blair's team win for the night, the score now 36-18 in favor of the Blazers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the 170-pound weight class, senior Shalom Ayivi was pinned by his opponent, but sophomore Izu Nweke ended the meet on a high note for Blair, pinning his opponent and finalizing the score 42-24. "It made me feel happy because people came out to support me and I was able to put on a show for them," Nweke said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Head coach Tim Grover was impressed by the huge win, especially because the match with Clarksburg is tight every year. "The past five years it's been a one- or two-point difference in the team score," he said. "That was going to be one of the toughest matches of the month, so we should be able to string together more wins in January."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Kaplan noted that just getting out on the mat is a celebration on its own. "Just going out there and being able to beat someone up for six minutes is the celebration," he said. "The work is done every day in the room, so it's great to get a chance and showcase what we've done."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Grover and the team captains were enthusiastic about what this meet means for the future. "We're really looking toward those regional ranking, county rankings and state rankings," Chen said. "This was just a check off the box as we look toward to big teams like Damascus and Springbrook."</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home meet on Tuesday, Jan. 14 against Northwood at 6:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32529
32349	How Blazers are celebrating this Thanksgiving season	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thanksgiving dinner brings to mind a steaming turkey sitting atop a warm table, complemented by oh-so-juicy cranberries, mashed potatoes with too much gravy and brown stuffing. But wait! Where's the chicken? The lamb? The injera? The paella? These are just a few of the culinary styles that have found their place in our fellow Blazers’ annual family Thanksgiving traditions.﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32348"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair hosts students of all backgrounds who bring unique delicacies and family traditions to their own Thanksgiving season. Junior Issac Seleshi, like many students, celebrates Thanksgiving with a festive meal that has come to include injera, a traditional Ethiopian bread. Seleshi is not alone in bringing ethnic food into the traditional Thanksgiving palate. Sophomore John Rivera, who comes from a Hispanic background, gets a mix of both American and Hispanic tastes at the Thanksgiving table. "Our family has a mix of American classics and Hispanic food," Rivera says. "We make rice and tortillas."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In keeping with the spirit of turkey pardoning, the classic Thanksgiving poultry is literally starting to make an escape from holiday tables. Junior Soella Asikoye's family started saying no to the turkey after realizing that other meats are juicier. "We tried turkey for so long, but it's just so dry," Asikoye says. "So we try chicken or lamb. Each year we try to cook with different meat."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Apart from the feast that accompanies this holiday, Thanksgiving is also a time for students to take a break from school and relax. Junior Sabontu Hassen uses this time to get together with her family. "We cook traditional foods and then we spend time with the family going shopping," Hassen says. Similarly, Asikoye's Thanksgiving week is, in one word, relaxing. "We have a few family members over and my mom would throw a holiday party," Asikoye says. "We cook food, sit down and eat, listen to holiday music, watch a movie and then go out with her friends."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While some Blazers buy turkeys, why buy a turkey when you can hunt one? Freshman Sarela Lanza's family brings in some action this holiday season. Her parents are from Bolivia and Spain, where it is a tradition for families to hunt turkeys. "In our countries, both Bolivia and Spain, we usually go out to shoot turkeys," Lanza says. "After we catch some, we give them to another family and they would clean the turkey and feather it."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While maintaining the traditional turkey dish, Lanza's multicultural family stuffs the turkey with their own Bolivian spin. They add cuñape, a soft and creamy </span><a href="https://www.boliviabella.com/cunape-cheese-bread-balls.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Bolivian cheese ball</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, along with paella, a rich Spanish rice-and-shrimp dish, to the dinner table. "Whenever someone gets married, a new tradition comes into the family," Lanza says. "It's really great how it all comes together."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blazers may have different backgrounds and traditions, but what unifies us during these festive times is the thread of gratitude that goes through each and every one of us. So, go out and enjoy this Thanksgiving season in your own way. But no matter how you celebrate, remember to reflect upon the people and events in your life that you are thankful for. Happy Thanksgiving!</span></p>	32348
32671	Step aside Ratatouille, dishes from the Lunar Year of the Rat are coming through	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Traditional dishes bring families close, and shared culture brings them even closer. Among the lights, parades and performances, the smell of sweet and savory home-cooked foods wafts through the Lunar New Year festivities. Just as Chinese parents brought these </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/magnet-foundation-opens-arms-for-end-of-semester-teacher-luncheon-32628/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">dishes to the staff luncheon</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> at Blair, scroll through these recipes to introduce the same Asian delights into your own household.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Dumplings</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Eating dumplings is the Chinese New Year staple, especially in Northern China. "We always eat dumplings because of the meaning of best wishes for the New Year. The pronunciation of dumpling means change, like a transition from old to new," says Ling Liu, mother of junior Christopher Tong.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/how-to-make-chinese-dumplings" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Full recipe and directions</a></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Families usually prepare dumplings together, dividing up the many steps: rolling out the dumplings wrappers, folding in the filling, and cooking the finished product. Some dumplings have a hidden coin inside to bless the family member with wealth and prosperity.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jasmine Tea</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Zhen Yuan, mother of junior Yichi Zhang, explains the importance of tea during the staff luncheon. "Chinese people don't drink Chinese tea because they are thirsty—it's a lifestyle. We visit relatives, teachers and friends, and we just have tea and chat together. It's a necessary part of Chinese [New Year]," Yuan says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32668"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Chinese drink a variety of tea, ranging from fruit teas to other flower teas such as chrysanthemum. These teas are brewed without any other ingredients such as honey or sugar. "Originally, we drink plain tea as it is. We have other things to serve with the tea, like tea desserts like roasted peanuts, which mean longevity in Chinese culture," Yuan says. Rather than bring luck to the drinker, tea represents familial togetherness.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Spring Rolls</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lunar New Year also signifies the beginning of spring, so spring rolls are frequently present at the table alongside other traditional dishes. "On the day of Start of Spring, people wrap lettuce in crusts and make spring rolls. People eat them separately to pray for good health. This is called "biting spring" and gradually becomes daily food," Bin Chen, mother of junior Christina Chen, says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32669"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A popular saying in China relates spring rolls to gold bars (黄金万两 -huang-jin wang-liang) due to the food's deep golden color when fried, which represents wealth and prosperity.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/chinese-spring-roll/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Full recipe and directions</a></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fish</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"Fish (鱼 - yu) in Chinese sounds like 'rich', or that you have more than enough," Liu says. Due to this double meaning, eating fish on New Year's Eve represents a lucky symbol for the future.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32667"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"When we cook the fish, we don't chop off the tail or head, we cook the whole fish and present it on the table," Yuan says. In various areas in China, the tail and head should be saved until after the new year begins in hopes of having surplus for the entire year.</span></p><p><a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-braised-fish-hongshao-yu-2/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Full recipe and directions.</a></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ddukguk - Rice Cake Soup&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to China's parades, foods and customs, other countries in East Asia have developed unique Lunar New Year traditions, including food special to their nations. In Korea, Lunar New Year, called Seollal (설날), goes hand in hand with a common dish called ddeokguk. This dish is a rice cake soup, where slices of white rice cake are topped with sliced egg, meat and roasted seaweed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/tteokguk" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Full recipe and directions.</a></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32666"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Tradition says that eating ddeokguk marks another year, allowing every person to age one year. Sophomore John Kim explains the aging process, "My parents say 'If you don't eat your ddukguk, you won't get older, John.' In Korea, when you're born, you start out as one year old, and on New Year you gain another year."</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Bánh Chưng and Bánh Tét - Sticky Rice Cakes&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Vietnamese Blazers celebrate Lunar New Year, called Tet, with dishes consisting of sticky rice, green peas and pork wrapped in banana leaves. Junior Nick Bach explains the difference between the two sticky rice dishes served in Vietnam. "People in the north [of Vietnam] usually eat Bánh Chưng during New Year, while people in the south eat Bánh Tét," Bach says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32670"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Bánh Chưng and Bánh Tét are similar in ingredients, but the latter is a modified version of the former in its round shape. "The circular [rice cake] represents the moon, and the square represents the ground or Earth," Bach says.</span></p><p><a href="https://danangcuisine.com/recipes/recipe-banh-chung-vietnamese-square-sticky-rice-cake/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Full recipe and directions.</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While these dishes signify wealth, luck, and age, they ultimately bestow good fortune and love onto each family member. "[Lunar] New Year is the most important holiday for Asian people, somewhat like Thanksgiving with the meaning of family reunion and changing to the next year for best wishes and staying healthy, rich, all the good wishes for family," says Liu.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Editor's Note: Christina Chen is a photographer for Silver Chips Print.</em></p>	32666

33056	During COVID-19, the orchestra live-streams its concerts to viewers for free	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the National Philharmonic decided to live stream all concerts to viewers watching from home for the entirety of the 2020-2021 season. Every other Sunday starting from Oct. 25, the renowned orchestra will play at the Strathmore Music Center, while their performances are broadcasted for free to Youtube, Vimeo, Facebook, and the National Philharmonic website.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33055"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Unlike many other professional orchestras who have had to cancel their 2020-2021 season (including the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/13/923236139/new-york-philharmonic-cancels-its-entire-2020-21-season-due-to-coronavirus" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">New York Philharmonic</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><a href="https://cso.org/pages/alert/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Chicago Symphony Orchestras</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">), the National Philharmonic is working under social distancing regulations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The season started on Sunday, Oct. 25 with a celebration of a few of Beethoven’s earlier works. The performance, named the “Beethoven @ 250 Birthday Bash,” marked Beethoven’s 250th birthday. Led by conductor Piotr Gajewski, the National Philharmonic delivered a remarkable performance that astounded the audience even through a computer screen.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The program started with </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Romance for Violin and Orchestra No. 1 in G Major, Op. 40</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, one of Beethoven’s first claims to fame in music composition. The piece was performed by soloist Nurit Bar-Josef, concertmaster of the National Symphony Orchestra, who is known for her passionate work as one of the U.S.’s youngest concertmasters. She performed the piece with a solid and well-rounded style, never too overbearing in her passion. In places where she could have been more intense, she didn’t go overboard, instead slightly hinting at it while keeping her movements and passion under control.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Romance for Violin and Orchestra No. 2 in F Major, Op. 50 </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">followed, performed by Jonathan Carney, concertmaster of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Romance in F Major </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">is well known for being one of the hardest Beethoven romances to play — the soloist must channel their own intensity and freedom into the piece, but stay strictly in coordination with the rest of the orchestra to achieve the full effect that Beethoven intended.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Carney played the romance with overwhelming passion, which could be heard in his playing and seen in his movements as well. Still, he was able to carefully flow in and out of tempo, never seeming to be uncoordinated with the rest of the orchestra. His performance conveyed a sense of confidence, and a feeling of reassurement that is only achieved with decades of practice.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Before finishing the program with Beethoven’s </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Symphony No. 1 in C Major, Op. 21</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Gajewski took a moment to explain the genius of the piece. He walked the audience through the opening to each movement, showing how Beethoven broke each of the previously established rules for symphony composition. “Beethoven would go on to re-invent the symphony form with almost every new attempt… but it all began with this -- Symphony No. 1,” Gajewski concluded, tying up his explanation before leading the orchestra in an impressive finale.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gajewski’s explanations about </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Symphony No. 1</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> allowed the audience to enjoy the individuality of Beethoven’s compositions, and kindled a special connection between conductor, orchestra and audience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The orchestra itself maintained social distancing, with only a few members from each instrumental section performing in the concert. Still, they managed to bring some artistic flair to the performance, which could be seen and felt even through the screen. Performers wore custom sparkled National Philharmonic masks, and each music stand was adorned with a bouquet of bright flowers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout the entirety of the livestream, viewers showered the Youtube live chat with praise, remarking on the soloists’ performances and thanking performers for persevering during these tough times. Viewers felt as if they were part of the orchestra themselves, seeing performers up close through the numerous camera angles, which added to the intimacy of the performance.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite not being able to perform in person, the National Philharmonic has managed to continue their tradition of delivering top-notch concerts, and will indubitably continue to do so throughout the rest of the season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The National Philharmonic’s next performance will be on Sunday, Nov. 22 at 2 p.m. The 2020-2021 season information can be found at </em><a href="https://nationalphilharmonic.org/season/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>https://nationalphilharmonic.org/season/</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </em></p>	33055
32302	After several controversial calls in the 2019 World Series, support for robot umpires has risen	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The historic 2019 World Series saw a lot of drama. It was the first series ever where the away team won every single game, and the Washington Nationals' first championship. One of the most memorable parts of the series, though, was the umpires' officiating.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32301"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout the series, the umpires made calls that influenced the game's outcome, and could have changed the series champion. The balls and strikes were the main concerns, since the umpires' strike zones had many fluctuations and inconsistencies. The tendency for human error makes a clear case for the league to seriously consider robotic umpires.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The biggest problem with the umpires' officiating in the World Series was the lack of consistency. During the bottom of the 7th inning in Game 5, the Nationals trailed 4-1 behind the Houston Astros. Ryan Zimmerman came to the plate, worked to a full count then watched a pitch just outside the strike zone for a walk. This gave Victor Robles a man on first base with two outs and a chance to shorten the deficit. Robles had a full count and watched a pitch that seemed further out of the strike zone than the Zimmerman's pitch, but it was called strike three and ended the inning. The outcome of the game could have been very different if the tying run was brought to the plate with a chance to shorten the lead.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though umpires can't be perfect, the inconsistency in calls is frustrating. To have two pitches in the exact same spot but receive different calls is mind-boggling to players, managers and fans everywhere. Consistency of strike calls is the major appeal of robotic umpires.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although robotic umpires seem like a necessity after seeing the calls made in the World Series, the change will take away a human element of the game. "Yes, we're complaining about umpires and bad calls right now, but without them we'll never get to see teams' managers throw absurd tantrums after getting ejected in a meaningless regular season game in July," Blair junior Luke Treanor says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair junior Jackson Plank agrees that human umpires would help players to build relationships and reputations with umpires. Players like Anthony Rendon and Jose Altuve have good reputations for not arguing with umpires, while players like Bryce Harper are almost famous for their rage with umpires. "Sometimes players are able to establish good relationships with umpires and it helps them get favorable calls. A robotic umpire might be better overall for this because it will not have bias, but as a player it is nice to get a little advantage," Plank says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the summer of 2019, the robot umpire was </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/07/10/baseballs-robot-umpires-are-here-you-might-not-even-notice-difference/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">tested in the Atlantic League</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, but it wasn't fully robotic. There was a human umpire behind the plate, wearing an Apple AirPod, connected to an iPhone in his back pocket. The Bluetooth and iPhone connected to a software that made judgment on balls and strikes. These decisions were transmitted to the umpire, who would make the call based on the software's judgement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The robot umpire seemed to be pretty successful, as the Automated Ball-Strike System (ABS) could make calls based on a strike zone for each player. While the ABS could do that, there was a glitch with bounced pitches crossing the plate, but the human umpire could overrule those by changing the call. Treanor echoed a similar stance. "If the robots malfunction or something, who is going to be there to make the calls? The worst thing the MLB could do would be getting rid of human umpires entirely," Treanor says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is impossible that robots can take over umpires' job, because there are some things that a robot cannot judge, like running outside the base path. But, they will mostly be used for an automated strike zone. "What’s being proposed is mostly just automated strike zones, which I think is a good idea, but umpires have to do much more throughout the course of a game besides calling balls and strikes," Plank said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Robotic umpires have become a serious possibility that may appear in the coming years, but there remains a need for a human umpire to fill in the mistakes and shortcomings of the robots.</span></p>	32301
32645	The expanded playoff could include six or more teams	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since the creation of the College Football Playoff (CFP) in 2014, the National Championship has become more interesting and exciting for fans. While the new format is great, it can be improved by expanding the playoff to six, or even eight teams.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The selection process over the years has caused a lot of uproar and disagreement from fans. So far, the committee has always picked teams from the Power Five (P5) conferences (Big Ten, Atlantic Coastal Conference, Big 12, PAC-12, Southeastern Conference) and Notre Dame, which is considered a P5 school.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The committee hasn't even ranked a non-P5 school higher than eighth in all of the final CFP rankings. That one eighth-seeded team was the 12-1 University of Central Florida team in 2018, with their only loss being by eight points to LSU in the Fiesta Bowl. Clearly, they were a strong enough team to give other P5 teams some competition in the playoffs.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The six team format would include the top two seeds receiving a first round bye, then matchups between the third and sixth seeds and fourth and fifth seeds. The six teams would most likely include P5 conference champions and at least one non-P5 team. Of course, there would be an exception if a conference champion has a few losses or had a flawed regular season.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But, some fans would disagree with this because they believe that the non-P5 team is not worthy, due to the lacking strength of their schedule boosting their record. This is where eight teams would come into play. The eight teams would be the P5 conference champions, the best non-P5 team (chosen by committee) and a wild-card team from each of the P5 and non-P5, chosen by the committee.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The eight-team playoff would be just like the four-team, but with an additional round and more teams, and possibly a reseeding system. In addition, the eight-team format would be able to fill out what is known as the New Years' Six (Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Peach Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Cotton Bowl), with the first six games being those six, and of course the final is the championship.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only will increasing the number of competing teams make for better playoff games, but it will also boost motivation among teams to make the playoffs. In addition, having a guaranteed spot to make the playoffs will really push the non-P5 teams to compete on a national stage for a national title, knowing that they won't just end up in a regular bowl game.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32644"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even without the snubbing of non-P5 teams, there have been several top programs with talented teams that were snubbed from the CFP. In 2014, a one-loss team in TCU that was ranked third going into championship weekend was snubbed. In 2015, Stanford was ranked seventh, although having just one loss in a year that there was just one unbeaten team. With Notre Dame, they always have superior schedule strength, but always seem to get left out, with the exception of 2018.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While it would make the season longer, the regular season can be shortened to make up for that. Take away one of the non-conference games that will likely be a non-contest and make up for it with a week of potentially exciting games.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Expanding the College Football Playoff will boost ratings for the television networks, it will motivate teams, it will bring happiness to more fans, it will include non-P5 teams and it will provide a greater opportunity to see upsets and truly narrow it down to the two best teams. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32644
33568	Blazers learn more about Hispanic and Latinx cultures through fun activities all month long.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It's 7:45 a.m on Sept. 15, and a sea of students streams through Blair's hallways on their way to class. While most students wear muted t-shirts and hoodies, dozens of students are wearing flags around their shoulders, and others still don vibrant soccer jerseys. This is the first day of Hispanic Heritage Month, where Blair celebrates the contributions of its Hispanic and Latinx communities to the school and the United States.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hispanic Heritage Month, which lasts from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, originated in 1968 under the directive of President Lyndon Johnson, and in 1988, it was expanded from a week to a month by President Ronald Reagan.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This month includes the independence days of several Central American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua on Sept. 15; Mexico on Sept. 16 and Chile on Sept 18. Students and staff learn about the variety of foods, clothing and values. This is especially important at Blair since </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/regulatoryaccountability/glance/currentyear/schools/04757.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">33.7 percent</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> of the Blazers are Hispanic or Latinx.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">ESOL teacher Michael Herlihy believes that this month gives the students a sense of acknowledgement. "I think the kids feel recognized for who they are. The school does it throughout the year, so it's not like they only feel recognized during this month, but I think it is still important that they feel recognized," Herlihy says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Spanish teacher Dianette Coombs further explains why it is so important to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. "Blair is a microcosm of the community. So we must recognize the cultures that are represented in Blair . . . We need to talk about the distinct ethnic groups that live here: the Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, etc. We must share … their culture [and] food," Coombs explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Geo Rivera says that the significance of recognizing Hispanic Heritage Month is more than celebrating individuals. "When we share our stories, we are more accepting, and we are eliminating ignorance, which is where most of hate is rooted, so I think we would be doing everyone a disservice by staying quiet," Rivera says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair offers a variety of activities and events in honor of this month. Previous events included a lunchtime mariachi concert (Sept. 15) and an indoor soccer tournament (Sept. 21-Present).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One main celebration at Blair is Voces Unidas, which is Blair's Hispanic Heritage Month show. There are singers, dancers, and actors who perform cultural pieces. The show's focus is to celebrate the contributions of the Hispanic and Latinx countries around the world and to Blair.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">That said, despite the abundance of activities, students feel that the Hispanic Heritage Month Committee (HHM) needs to improve on their advertising of these events and celebrations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Originally, the calendar was only found on Principal Renay Johnson's Twitter page, so many students were unaware of these events. Senior Xiomara Deodanes wasn't aware about the celebrations until her ESOL teacher told her to look at the calendar on Johnson's Twitter page. "In the beginning, I didn't know about the events during lunch," Deodanes says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nevertheless, this celebration is a step forward for Blair in honoring its Hispanic and Latinx communities. Rivera notes that Blair only recently started celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. "We didn't have anything for this month up until three years ago," Rivera says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Assistant Principal Adriana Burgos-Ojeda says that the momentum for this month continues to grow. "Before, I used to have to reach out to our media outlets, and now people are coming to me, recommending activities and asking what is going on. So it's now part of the natural dialogue," Burgos-Ojeda explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the upcoming weeks, there will be art and music-related events. A Frida Kahlo exhibit will be on display in the media center from Oct. 12 to Oct. 15. Latin music is played in the courtyard every Wednesday, and Voces Unidas will be on Oct. 23. Events are still being added and can all be found in the </span><a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAEp0DHbUZw/oxsIHgFvOkPJffe2ES3aPg/view?utm_content=DAEp0DHbUZw&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=sharebutton#1" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">calendar</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Burgos-Ojeda and the HHM welcome suggestions for future activities and celebrations. "We are just extremely open to what anyone wants to do. Any student or staff member that comes up with an idea and wants to deliver is welcome and encouraged to do so," Burgos-Ojeda says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With such a large and involved Latinx community here at Blair, there’s no doubt that student and staff input will help Hispanic Heritage Month continue to improve each year.&nbsp;</span></p>	33567
32829	Will our dramatic lifestyle changes have a prolonged influence on the world’s climate?	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our daily lives. Authorities implemented strict lockdowns protocols throughout China and India, leaving streets deserted. In Italy, the government is upholding the harshest travel restrictions since World War II. Worldwide, social distancing protocols are leaving flights on hold and keeping visits to tourist attractions </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/dc-during-quarantine-32788/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">sparse</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One silver lining in this dark situation seems to be the positive environmental impact of the travel bans. According to China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment, emissions fell </span><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coronavirus-has-temporarily-reduced-chinas-co2-emissions-by-a-quarter" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">25 percent</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in January and the proportion of days with “good quality air” was up </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200326-covid-19-the-impact-of-coronavirus-on-the-environment" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">11.4 percent</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in comparison to the same duration of the previous year. In Italy, Spain and the UK, satellite images show that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions are becoming less prominent. But is this shift sustainable?</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32828"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If people maintain their lifestyle changes after lockdowns are lifted, they could help keep emissions low. Social experiments suggest that this is possible. A </span><a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaad73" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">2018 study</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> at Zurich University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland revealed that when people were unable to drive, the amount of time they spent driving decreased when they got their cars back. A 2001 study at Kyoto University in Japan had similar results: when a major road closed, people switched to public transportation, and when the road reopened, drivers continued to choose public transportation on multiple occasions.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We can hope that quarantine introduces similar habits. Traveling less and cutting down on waste are both lifestyle changes that we should continue even after the pandemic ends. But the reality is that people will resume their commutes to work. Those who are cancelling vacations now are simply planning to take them later. Frequent flying is a large contributor to the carbon footprint, so carbon emissions could just as easily return.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The global financial crisis of 2008 mirrors the environmental consequences of such decisions and behaviors. Back then, carbon dioxide emissions fell by </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/16/how-covid-19-could-impact-climate-crisis" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">1.4</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> percent, only to rise by </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/16/how-covid-19-could-impact-climate-crisis" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">5.9</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> percent and reach an all-time high in 2010. However, the coronavirus crisis could pose greater harm on the environment because it is hindering the global community’s ability to counter the effects of climate change.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2020 was supposed to be a pivotal year for climate change efforts. The United Nations’ annual climate summit was supposed to take place in November, but has since been postponed to 2021. Leading up to the summit, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">196 countries planned to release their plans to meet the emission reduction goals set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. Other international efforts relating to biodiversity and oceans are also stalled. The need to act on climate is urgent, but the inability to do so at this time makes matters more dire.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Overall, it’s unclear what the long-term environmental effects of isolation will be. One big factor is how long the pandemic lasts. Nonetheless, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">history shows us that both positive and negative outcomes could become a reality. The circumstances are in no way ideal, but </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">making a positive long-term impact on the climate could be the silver lining we need.&nbsp;</span></p>	32828
33301	The controversy around recording Zoom lessons.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As schools settle into a routine of online classes, the requirement for teachers to record lessons has caused controversy among teachers, parents, and students over privacy rights.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCPS has given teachers two options for supplying instruction to students who missed class. The first option is for teachers to record Zoom classes and keep them available to students for 72 hours with password encryption. The second is for teachers to record instructional content outside of class and supply that material to students.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe county informed teachers that when recording live classes, they should try to capture the lesson material while minimizing the display of students to the greatest extent possible, thus both protecting student privacy and increasing the accessibility of class content.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are some good reasons to be recording video conferences,” Linnette Attai, the author of two books discussing the protection of student data privacy, says. She notes the importance for students with accessibility accommodations, students who missed class, and students who want to review lessons to be able to access class recordings.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAttai, however, believes that there should also be guidelines for these recordings. “When the recordings happen, they need to be done with really careful consideration for not only why they are being recorded, but how they are being protected, how they are being stored, and how students are able to access the recordings,” she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMCPS has attempted to address these privacy concerns, stating that recordings are automatically deleted after 72 hours and are only accessible to students enrolled in the class through an MCPS login.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tJunior Edwige Ghembesalu echoes privacy concerns but prefers the videos to be permanently available. “If the 72 hours system wasn’t there, I definitely would review a bunch of them before a test,” she says. “But since they’re gone after 72 hours, I don’t think I’ll be using [the Zoom recordings]."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFor junior Ethan Shoham, recorded sessions are not an issue because only students in the class can access them. “Sharing a recording with the class doesn’t violate a student’s privacy. Presumably, the class can see the student anyways,” Shoham says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn the interest of increasing student privacy, MCPS guidelines give parents and guardians the option to opt their child out of participating in Zoom classes while it is being recorded through a form found on ParentVue. In practice, many Blair teachers allow students to self-select but prefer that their students turn on their camera due to the difficulty of effectively teaching without student feedback. One such teacher is John Kaluta, a technology teacher at Blair. “It really makes me more comfortable if I see everybody’s face,” he says. “If I have gallery view on and I’m looking, I can see people nod their head, for instance, which would make it a little, teeny bit more like the classroom.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe main difference between students opting out by choice and parents filling out the official form is that with the former, teachers can still call on students to participate while the class is being recorded.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWhile teachers may prefer students to have their cameras on, the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of student education records across the country. However, the interpretation of whether a class recording is a part of a student’s education record remains up to the school district.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMaryland has three laws addressing student privacy: the 2015 Student Data Privacy Act, the 2017 Student and Workforce Data Linkage—Extension of Time Limit, and the 2018 Student Data Governance.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAccording to a 2019 study by Student Privacy Matters, these three laws often do not address specific metrics like transparency, oversight, and enforcement, which the study used to evaluate the comprehensiveness of statewide student privacy protection. This study, in which lower ranks mean more comprehensive laws, ranked Maryland as No. 31 out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C. based on seven privacy-related categories.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33300"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brad Shear, an MCPS parent and attorney who has worked numerous privacy cases, opted his children out of participating or turning on their cameras during Zoom classes this fall because he believes that students’ homes should remain private. Shear brings up instances in other districts where students were suspended because of their home environments. “Kids are getting suspended and being threatened with arrest based upon things that the teachers take a look at inside of the student’s homes,” he says. According to Shear, in one case, a 12-year-old Black student with ADHD was suspended for a week and now has a mark on his permanent record because he was holding a toy gun.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOn a more local scale, some students, like freshman Alex Feingold-Black, think that recording Zoom sessions inhibits student participation. “When teachers record Zoom classes, the classes do become a lot more awkward and silent because no one wants to share,” he says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAccording to Leigh Tinsley, an English teacher at Blair, recording Zoom sessions can also be distracting for students and teachers. “Being on camera is just a hard thing for people to deal with and the adolescent age group is very critical of how you [look] on camera,” she says. Tinsley furthers that the added layer of self-consciousness when a Zoom session is being recorded decreases students’ desire to answer questions or contribute to class discussion.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tTinsley also believes that recording Zoom classes is an unnecessary step. “We are already doing what we need to do to make sure those kids can access the material, and I don’t think any teacher––if we know what is going on with the student––would be unwilling to help that child gain access to the material,” she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe controversy comes down to balancing the best way to teach students while maintaining privacy. MCPS has offered various provisions to ensure student privacy, including a 72-hour limit for accessing recordings, password encryption, opt-out forms, the choice to turn cameras off, and two recording options for teachers. As the school year progresses, Attai believes MCPS and the community will continue to revise these policies to further protect students while providing an engaging learning environment. “We just need to give the time and space for everyone to put their creative energies to that problem,” she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tVirtual zoom backgrounds are one potential solution to student privacy issues. The feature attempts to replace the user’s background and protect student privacy while on camera. However, they are not without controversy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMCPS banned the use of virtual backgrounds this summer, citing an effort to maintain technological equity among students. The county provided tens of thousands of Chromebooks to students for use during virtual learning.These devices do not have the required processing power for virtual backgrounds, so only students using devices not supplied by the school system would be able to access this feature.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMCPS cited concerns about inappropriate content being displayed on student backgrounds. Peter Cevenini, the Associate Superintendent of Technology and Innovation, said during the Board of Education’s business meeting on Aug. 25 that MCPS has worked to “balance safety and security” with community needs. For this reason, in addition to restrictions on virtual Zoom backgrounds, students are required to have their real names on their displays. “The system also prohibits students from changing their usernames to avoid ‘anonymous use,’” according to an article in the Bethesda Beat.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tTechnological limitations also make keeping a stable image of the speaker superimposed over the background difficult, which can be districting for teachers and students.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBrad Shear, an MCPS parent and attorney who has worked numerous privacy cases, testified before the Board of Education about virtual backgrounds during their business meeting on Oct. 6. In an interview with Silver Chips, Shear explained why he believes the MCPS’ decision to restrict virtual backgrounds for students but not teachers is unfair. “Montgomery County is blocking students from being able to use a digital background. However, on the flip side they are allowing teachers to use the digital background,” Shear says. “That is discriminatory against the students, and it’s basically saying to students that they are second class citizens in Montgomery County when they are actually the customers.”</span></p>	33300
32465	A stack of cash is neither a show of thoughtfulness nor a spirited effort	<p><em>Click </em><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/con-economically-and-ecologically-holiday-gifting-is-nothing-to-celebrate-32467/" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em> to read the opposing argument, "CON: Economically and ecologically, holiday gifting is nothing to celebrate."</em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Imagine watching a bubbly toddler waking up on Christmas morning, running down to the Christmas tree to open their presents. The wide-eyed enamored child’s excitement turns to tears when all they see is an envelope filled with bills. Face it: gift giving is an irreplaceable tradition; it is a universal way to show interest, appreciation, and gratitude.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32464"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yes, gift giving is stressful. It can be hard to know exactly what someone wants. But that is precisely the challenge. Finding the perfect gift for friends and family shows how well you know them and tells them that you take the time to truly listen when they’re talking. The warm feeling that you get when you see a smile on the face of someone you’ve given a gift to makes all the holiday stress worth it. Senior Liang Lin mentions that a gift shows a deeper appreciation. “I prefer a tangible item because it shows that there was some thought put into it,” Lin says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gift smart. Holiday gifting is becoming increasingly expensive because people spend extravagant amounts of money on items that they think the recipients desire.&nbsp;But, if you don’t know the person well, these efforts are usually wasted. These are the people for which a gift card or a box of chocolates is the best present.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Furthermore, an expensive gift may carry a negative connotation. Making large purchases does not necessarily translate to more thought and effort, unless the pricey gift is something the giftee really desires. The best presents can often be pleasant memories or personalized creations; planning a quick trip, curating a homemade video, putting together a photo book, or an art project all show time and effort, while other gifts can occasionally feel as though money was mindlessly thrown towards them.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Secret Santa is becoming increasingly difficult because people cannot anticipate what their selected recipient desires. But that’s no reason to stop gifting. Wish lists are the easy way out, but this exchange is actually the perfect opportunity to gift the unexpected. If people are always given exactly what they want or need, it confines their interests. Holiday season is the time to surprise a friend with something they personally wouldn’t pick out.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Money is an impersonal gift, and everyone knows it’s a shortcut. Of course, the money is important, but there is no sentimental value. Furthermore, as junior Shariar Vaez-Ghaemi puts it, money usually flows into people’s savings. “I prefer a gift, because it’s something that I can cherish now. When I get money, I probably save it,” Vaez-Ghaemi says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The only flaw with the gifting process is that it is not environmentally friendly. Endless rolls of wrapping paper, excess packaging, and the use of non-recyclable materials makes the holidays one of the most wasteful times of the year. Gifting clearly has benefits, but the wrapping doesn’t. Being conscious of how a gift is packaged has a tremendously positive ecological </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/top-picks-for-sustainable-holiday-gifting-32370/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">impact</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gift giving simply cannot be replaced with cash. It’s a fundamental part of the holidays that brings joy to all. That being said, it’s important to gift efficiently, rather than splurging on something that the recipient will neither use nor appreciate.&nbsp;</span></p>	32464
31646	The small restaurant combines fresh flavors with a homey atmosphere	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Tucked under a red awning on Carroll Avenue in Takoma Park, Cielo Rojo doesn't seem extraordinary from the outside. However, upon entering, it's bustling with people, even on an otherwise quiet Sunday afternoon. With everyone from families to people dining alone, the restaurant is becoming a popular spot in Old Town Takoma. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Opened by Maryland native Carolina McCandless and her husband David Perez in January, Cielo Rojo, which translates to Red Sky, is named for the couple's love of sunsets and a mariachi song of the same name. McCandless and Perez, who met in San Francisco and moved back to Maryland last year, were inspired by traditional Mexican and Californian flavors when creating their restaurant. Before finding a permanent spot in Takoma Park, Cielo Rojo was a pop-up in several spots around the area, such as the now-closed Capital City Confectionary. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cielo Rojo’s Mexican influence is evident from the moment you step inside. The restaurant is small, with a short bar that faces the open kitchen, a few tables covered in traditional </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">talavera</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> tiles and an ordering counter tucked in a corner. The small interior, resembling a home kitchen, makes for a welcoming atmosphere that puts you at ease as soon as you walk in. The upbeat mariachi music, colorful tapestries and rustic carts and shelves add to the homey mood. Your eyes will definitely be drawn to the vibrant photographs of Mexico scattered across the walls.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cielo Rojo's take on the classic chips-and-guacamole combo is sure to please those looking for a&nbsp;traditional appetizer. The guacamole is smooth and fresh, and the slight dryness of the accompanying </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">tostadas</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> —&nbsp;a nice change from traditional tortilla chips at other Mexican restaurants — is offset by their freshness and satisfying crunch. The small portion of guacamole is the perfect size for a starter and ensures that you have room left for the enticing entrees that come your way not much later. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31643"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The tacos, served a la carte and with a variety of </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">guisado</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> options, are small but delicious. The </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">nopales</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> taco is refreshing and tangy. The finely-diced tomatoes and cashew cream that top the taco add a dash of sweetness, while the chopped onions bring some slight spice into the mix, creating the perfect combination of flavors. The highlight of the dish is the tortilla itself —&nbsp;following the theme of other ethically-sourced food at Cielo Rojo, it is made from organic, tender heirloom corn from Oaxaca.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31644"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The drunken mushroom quesadillas are perfect for someone looking for a richer option reminiscent of comfort food. The soft, meaty mushrooms and warm, stringy Oaxaca and&nbsp;Chihuahua cheeses create a deep flavor that contrasts with the chewy tortilla. The crunchy, scattered sunflower seeds and spicy salsa add an interesting touch, bringing together a mix of surprising textures. The bright yellow color of the tortillas and cilantro garnish are the crowning touch of the quesadillas.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31645"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Like the food, the small details at Cielo Rojo deserve incredibly high praise. The variety of options at the restaurant, from </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">papas con rajas</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to salads with locally-sourced greens, makes it worth a visit for everyone, vegetarians and vegans included. The cheerful waitstaff put a smile on your face and the artful porcelain tableware is both practical and aesthetic. Cielo Rojo is the perfect spot for anyone looking for top-notch Mexican food in a cozy setting.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cielo Rojo is located at 7056 Carroll Ave. and is open Tuesday through Sunday for lunch and dinner.

33287	Como la pandemia ha agravado los problemas económicos de la comunidad de Langley Park.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tSiguiendo meses de calma económica debido a COVID-19, ha habido un gran aumento en las tasas de desplazamiento en la comunidad de Langley Park, MD; exacerbando el riesgo de gentrificación en el área.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33286"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Localizada dentro de el Capital Beltway, la comunidad de Langley Park se puede caracterizar por su vivienda de bajos ingresos y su demográfica consiste primariamente de hispanohablantes. Consistente con la tendencia que está sucediendo en todo el país, la pandemia COVID-19 ha demostrado ser un desafío adicional para la comunidad latinx, específicamente para grupos demográficos que son en su mayoría indocumentados.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLa comunidad de Langley Park se ve afectada por ambos factores, con 70 por ciento de sus residentes viviendo sin papeles y una gran parte de esa población hablando solamente español, de acuerdo a CASA Maryland, una organización que aboga por la comunidad indocumentada local. El impacto de COVID-19 en comunidades indocumentadas se debe en gran parte al tipo de trabajo que ocupan los individuos. Como una mayoría de trabajadores sin documentos están empleados en trabajos de salario mínimo con pocas protecciones, ese grupo es el que sufre más cuando hay un cismo económico, como COVID-19, que resulta en un aumento de tasas de desempleo.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAún antes de la pandemia, los residentes de Langley Park estaban afectados por una tasa alta de desempleo-- casi 36 por ciento más alta que el promedio nacional de acuerdo con un estudio de AreaVibes, un programa que examina las características y comodidades de un área. Con el COVID-19, esas tasas han surgido todavía más. Como consecuencia de este aumento, las tasas de desplazamiento también han subido vertiginosamente. Aunque el estado de Maryland ha dispersado $30 millones para prevenir evacuaciones a resultado de COVID-19, estos recursos no son muy accesibles para la gran mayoría de los residentes de Langley Park debido a su estado legal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLa zona de Langley Park se ha considerado por décadas como un lugar valioso con el potencial de ser desarrollada para maximizar capital urbana. De acuerdo a Bridget Broullire, una representante del Departamento de Planificación para el condado de Montgomery, Langley Park tiene comodidades atractivas. “Su proximidad a College Park y su infraestructura urbana son factores que hacen que Langley Park sea muy valioso'', dijo Broullire en un correo electrónico. Cuando hay muchas desplazadas de una área, es más fácil para los desarrolladores comprar espacios grandes donde pueden construir vivienda más cara.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHace unos años, había unos cambios hechos a la zonificación en el centro de Langley Park que, según Broullire, “se dedicaron a proporcionar más densidad, altura y flexibilidad al área”. Estos cambios a las políticas de zonificación facilitan la remodelación porque establecen la posibilidad de desarrollar el área más para cumplir con el potencial restablecido de las empresas y la vivienda.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLa amenaza inminente de desarrollo tiene implicaciones amplias para residentes de Langley Park, especialmente para los individuos que no tienen los recursos financieros para retroceder el impacto que la gentrificación tendría. Cuando una área se re-urbaniza, los precios de alquiler también aumentan para acomodar el nuevo valor de la propiedad. Más de tres cuartos de los residentes de Langley Park alquilan su vivienda e incluso pequeños aumentos de alquiler pueden tener un impacto trágico a los inquilinos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tSimilarmente, muchos de los negocios que existen en Langley Park también dependen en niveles estables de alquiler porque rentan su espacio. Restaurantes independientes estarán en riesgo de perder la capacidad de permanecer en Langley Park si su situación de alquiler cambia. Las empresas independientes en el área son pilares de la comunidad local y elementos esenciales a la cultura de Langley Park.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tComo una gran parte de trabajadores indocumentados, según el Centro de Estudios Migratorios, trabajan en “infraestructura crítica y esencial” (como servicios de salud, infraestructura, fabricación, alimentos, seguridad y otras necesidades de todos los estadounidenses), hay todavía muchas personas en Langley Park que se quedan sin trabajo. De acuerdo al gobernador de Maryland, Larry Hogan, las empresas de todo el estado tardarán en volver a abrir para evitar agravando la pandemia de COVID.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tPor el bien de la estabilidad financiera de Langley Park, esperamos que la pandemia se resuelva lo más rápido posible porque lo más tiempo que continúan estas tasas altas de desempleo, lo más que la comunidad estará plagada con desalojos forzosos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAfortunadamente para los residentes de Langley Park, “cualquier acción de desarrollo que podría pasar necesitaría pasar el boceto, un plan preliminar y los permisos, que es un proceso de varios años”, según Broullire. Si la re-urbanización es una posibilidad para Langley Park, esto será en un futuro distante.</span></p>	33286
31769	BlairHacks is entirely planned and run by students	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From 6:30 p.m. on Friday, March 15, to 9 p.m. on Saturday, members of the Blair Engineers' Guild hosted BlairHacks, a student-organized overnight hackathon for high school students. The event provided free food, drinks, hardware and swag for participants and was open to students with any level of coding experience. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">BlairHacks was founded two years ago by alumni from the class of 2018. This year, the four student organizers were sophomores Anika Dasgupta, Rajit Mukhopadhyay, Ethan Oh and Sujay Swain. The competition is intended to encourage students to view computer science from a more practical perspective. "For anybody who might not find computer science interesting, or doesn't like how it's taught in schools, this is a different way you can look at it," Swain said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31768"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the hackathon, students had 24 hours to plan, develop and present their novel ideas. Past projects include a biometric system, an easy way of implementing browser extensions and an original app. The hackathon also taught students to work in a team environment, problem-solve and get things done in a time crunch.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For students with no previous coding experience, BlairHacks ran workshops throughout the event to teach attendees how to use tools, such as Python, Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Professional and students mentors were also available to help students. The </span><a href="https://bh3.devpost.com/submissions" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">winners of the hackathon</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> received prizes such as bluetooth headphones and one-year subscriptions to Wolfram|Alpha Pro.</span></p>	31768
32443	The Blazers win 68-44 against the Titans	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair boys' varsity basketball team (3-1) won against the Einstein Titans (0-3) by a score of 68-44 in their second home game of the season on Friday night.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Within thirty seconds of the tip-off, junior guard Roman Cannuscio made a field goal starting off with 2-0. Towards the middle of the first quarter, the Titans started to catch up, but the Blazers played strong. Throughout the first quarter, junior guard Alfred Roy Worrell, junior center Tommy Waltz-Chesnaye and junior guard Jacob Briggs took successful shots at the hoop. By the end of the first quarter, however, Blair was only leading the game by a score of 21-18.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the second quarter, the Titans had a chance to mount a comeback. Two minutes and thirty seconds in, an Einstein player made a three-pointer, briefly putting the Titans in the lead with a score of 25-23. The second quarter ended with a close gap between the teams, 35-33.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout the third quarter, the Titans struggled to keep up with the Blazers. Worrell, senior forward Bakarr Bangura, junior guard Michael Ayala, senior guard Liam Olagbaju and Waltz-Chesnaye all made crucial shots, keeping Blair in the lead. The gap between the teams furthered, as the third quarter ended with a score of 52-40.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The last quarter was halted throughout with many timeouts called by the coaches. For the last two and a half minutes of the game, the Blazers successfully prevented the Titans from scoring. The game ended with an Einstein player taking the ball out of bounds. The game was over, and the boys came out with a 68-44 victory.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32442"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers learned from their last lost to Thomas Stone. Junior guard Khalif Welch thought that the team was more unified than the previous home game. "I feel like we were more together than the last game against Thomas Stone," Welch said. "We were dismantled. Now we are getting in our footing now. We know our defense. We are more knowledgeable." Coach Damon Pigrom still thought that there were some areas to improve on. "In the first half, we played undisciplined which kind of catered to Einstein's style of play," Pigrom said. "We have to pay attention to detail more."</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Monday, Jan. 6 against the Quince Orchard Cougars at 7:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32442

31945	A professional guide to not hearing things you don't want to hear	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Why am I up at 10:30 pm on a Sunday night? Is it to study for my AP Calculus test in two days? To prepare a French oral presentation that I have not started working on? To do the twenty other assignments I have to finish before the end of my senior year in ten days? To write this article that should have been written three days ago?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The answer to all of this, as you might expect, is a harsh and resounding no.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I am dead tired but awake late on Sunday night, so that I can watch the newest episode of Game of Thrones as soon as it comes out, not because I want to but so that nobody spoils it for me tomorrow. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31944"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For those of you who are prevented from watching the newest movie or TV episode by a freak car accident, case of measles, or category 5 hurricane (this is the extent of excusable options, anything beyond this and you are just lazy, what kind of person can't find any time to sit on a couch or in a theater for 1-3 hours most likely of a school night?), here are some helpful tips for avoiding spoilers:</span></p><ol><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Delete social media.</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;"> You know what is going on there, you know you won't be able to avoid tidbits of information in the comments. You can't have everything in life and so if you are going to make the choice to watch whatever it is at your own pace, you're going to have to give up selfies and Tasty videos until then. This might not be enough though, and if not you can…</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Get rid of anything connected to the internet.</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Can you trust that your friend won't call your phone and accidentally spoil that new movie for you when you least expect it? Can you trust that an innocuous google search will not come up with an article about the ending of that new show? No. you can't. Get rid of it. To really be sure that you safe though…</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Buy a pair of noise canceling headphones.</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;"> You've done what you can about your interactions online but it is statistically proven that </span><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-be-fooled-by-fake-stats-9f5f7d827d2b" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">over 60% of spoilers</a><span style="background-color: transparent;"> actually come out of interpersonal conversations. You can't control others, so you must make yourself less susceptible to this type of spoiler attack. These headphones will be your forcefield to block all incoming spoilers, but for them to be truly effective you must keep them on at all times day and night. However, once you start making it obvious externally that you are trying to avoid hearing the endings to things, people will get more aggressive in their attacks and you will need to take some extra steps…</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Stay at home in your room.</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;"> It's not that hard to do. There's a bed in there, maybe even a chair. You'll have to sneak out to the bathroom because you never know who might be home and you'll probably only be safe enough to go down to the kitchen after everyone goes to sleep. Maybe with all this newfound time you might be able to just watch the show. But if every squeak of the floorboards causes your heart to drop and every time you doorknob turns you break out into a sweat it may be time to take the next step…﻿</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Find a nice cabin in the middle of the woods.</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Go off the grid. You're basically surrounded by enemy spies now, all people who know information you don't who would do anything in their power to RUIN that movie for you. Trust no one. Tell no one where you are. Leave no trace. Only you can prevent forest fires. Anyway, this might not be enough because the woods in America are known to be filled with murderers and people who enjoy ruining things for others, so you might need to go even farther…</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">Travel to a country in which that show or movie does not exist. </strong><span style="background-color: transparent;">North Korea is a really nice option. China is good but not as great. It's a sacrifice you have to make for your own greater good. You might be able to find a job in a small steel mill or maybe a rice farm and even if you get sent to a work camp at least you can be sure that no one there will be able to make your life any worse by telling you spoilers. At end the end of the day though, and this might be a little extreme but don't balk, there's really only one way to prevent from having something spoiled for you…</span></li><li><strong style="background-color: transparent;">WATCH THE EPISODE/MOVIE!</strong><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Don't be that person that makes everyone around them censor themselves. If everyone else did it, you really don't have an excuse. If this is really not possible, if you were in a coma for the past ten years and are just trying to catch up on pop culture now, here are some things you can do...</span></li><li><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Suck it up.</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> It's not that big a deal.

32163	The Blazers move up to 4-3 after close win	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Oct. 19, the Blazers' varsity football team (4-3) defeated the Kennedy Cavaliers (2-5) by a score of 14-13 after being shut out in their last three games. This win keeps Blair at fourth place in the Montgomery County 4A North division and helps the Blazers remain in playoff contention.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the first quarter, Kennedy scooped a fumble from junior quarterback Khalif Welch, giving them good field position to score an early touchdown. A missed extra point would keep it a 6-0 lead for the Cavs. Blair came right back with a long run from senior running back Chris Watkins, which would lead to a rushing touchdown from Welch, giving the Blazers a 7-6 lead. Just a play later, Kennedy would take the lead right back and score on a 78-yard run. After a few scoreless possessions, junior defensive back Braxton Peck would lay a thunderous hit on a Kennedy ball carrier, forcing a fumble, which was recovered by senior defensive back Alex Zokouri. Zokouri returned the fumble for a touchdown, giving Blair a one point lead going into the half.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After a sloppy second half, with little offense and several penalties, Kennedy got the ball with 1:50 remaining in the game and a chance to win. A long pass put the Cavs inside the five-yard line with 30 seconds left, but with no timeouts. With the clock running, Kennedy ran the ball, which was stopped by the Blazers. The clock continued to run, and with enough time for one play, the Cavaliers' running back was stopped once again at the goal line. Junior defensive lineman Jaden Jackson forced the ball out, which would be recovered by junior defensive end Victor Clarke in the end zone for a touchback with zeros on the clock. Jackson knew the team fought too hard to lose at that point in the game. "I was just thinking we had come too far to lose now. I had enough trust in my team to recover the ball because I knew they felt the same way," Jackson said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32162"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Following three losses, it's refreshing for the team to finally get back in the win column. "I feel like I'm on Cloud 9 right now, this is the best feeling in the world right now," head coach Samual Nosoff said. Although the win feels good, the Blazers need to keep working hard to keep a potential playoff spot. "It feels good you know, but never be complacent, as they say, gotta keep working, come back out against Northwood next week, hopefully get a dub, do the same against Damascus and go into the playoffs with a winning streak," Welch said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers play their next game in the Battle of the Boulevard against the Northwood Gladiators on Oct. 25 at 6:30 p.m. at Northwood.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32162
32098	Two players transferred from Blair to new schools this summer	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Over the summer, the Blair boys' varsity basketball team lost two players. Junior guard Roman Cannuscio transferred to Woodrow Wilson High School (WWHS) and senior guard Andres Jones transferred to Albert Einstein High School (AEHS).</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In an </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1mmgOyBNen/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Instagram post on Aug. 25</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Cannuscio announced his transfer to WWHS due to basketball and family reasons. "For those who don't know, my family and I have decided that I will be moving to D.C. for basketball as well as family reasons, and attending Wilson H.S.," Cannuscio wrote in the post.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32097"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a senior, Jones was not satisfied with coming off of the bench, and believed he needed a bigger role at Blair. He transferred to AEHS to pursue better opportunities for his basketball career. "Einstein was just a better situation for me because I had a better connection with Coach Taylor and I knew he would help me with my goal of playing college basketball," Jones said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jones and Cannuscio's departures will have an impact on the team as both players had important roles. Jones was the team's sixth man, and Cannuscio was an all-around offensive threat. "They will definitely be missed because both of them provided things that are needed to win games and be a good basketball team," junior guard Michael Ayala said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite this setback, the team aims to keep moving forward. "We can not dwell on them, we have to keep moving forward and it's a next-man-up mentality for our team," Ayala said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although the two players won't be with the team this year, Jones and Cannuscio have faith that the Blazers can go far in the state playoffs. "I believe Blair will be state contenders, they have all of the pieces they need to win," Cannuscio said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After having a 4-6 record at the Capitol Hoops Summer League at DeMatha, the Blazers had some good competition to face in the summer. The Blazers also went 2-1 at the University of Maryland Team Camp. "I thought we had a good summer. We showed that we are talented and when we play together as a unit, we can compete with the better teams in the area," head coach Damon Pigrom said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The team thinks that they could do well this year with hard work and teamwork. "I think we’re one of the best teams in the county, we just have to believe in ourselves, play as a team and work hard," senior forward Abu-Bakarr Bangura said. Junior guard Alfred Worrell echoed the sentiment. "No one can mess with us. We are going to be underdogs and I love it," he said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Basketball player transfers were common in the DMV area this summer. </span><a href="https://www.dmvelite.com/news_article/show/1038970" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to DMVElite</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Jordan Hawkins (from Gaithersburg H.S.) transferred to DeMatha Catholic High School, Ryan Cornish (from Richard Montgomery H.S.) transferred to Sidwell Friends School, Elijah Wood (from Bethesda-Chevy Chase H.S.) transferred to Lincoln Academy and the list goes on.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Coaches of the Blair boys' varsity basketball team did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the transfer situation.</em></p><p><em>Update (10/16/19): Roman Cannuscio has transferred back to Montgomery Blair High School after just seven weeks at WWHS.

While there, he started coaching football, baseball and basketball at St. Joseph's Home for Boys, an orphanage located in Washington, D.C.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Wootten later transferred to the University of Maryland (UMD), where he graduated with a history and physical education degree in 1956. While at UMD, Wootten became the junior varsity coach for the basketball and football teams at St. John's College High School.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In 1956, Wootten was hired as a history teacher and became the head coach of the varsity basketball team at DeMatha, while also coaching football and baseball. He began exclusively coaching basketball starting with the team’s 1969 season.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Under Wootten, DeMatha won five national championships, 33 Washington Catholic Athletic Conference (WCAC) championships and 22 Washington D.C. championships. Wootten was also the first coach at any level to win 1,200 games. During Wootten's time at DeMatha, he coached several NBA and college basketball players such as Hall of Fame forward Adrian Dantley, Danny Ferry and many others.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">By the time Wootten retired in 2002, he had 1,274 wins, giving him the second-highest number of wins for a high school basketball coach of all time. Wootten led his team to two undefeated seasons. His worst season resulted in a 17-11 record, just one of his four 10-loss seasons.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Wootten was one of the founders of the McDonald's All-American Game, which has named the National Player of the Year award after him.

32365	What Blair students envision doing if they had more time	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When daylight savings time ended on Nov. 3, many students breathed a sigh of relief at getting an extra hour to catch up on sleep or finish homework. Other than that one special day of the year, there are only 24 hours in a day. But what would it be like to have an extra hour? What would Blazers do with that time?</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32364"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Some students would choose to sleep during their extra hour. Teenagers are known to be sleep-deprived, and students at Blair are no exception, which is why some would choose to spend their extra time sleeping. "I stay up late doing homework, so it'd be nice to catch up on some sleep," sophomore Leah Byler says. Schoolwork and other responsibilities are a priority for other Blair students. Those students would spend their extra hour catching up on homework and studying. "I would definitely use it to do extra work because I always like to be ahead," sophomore Camille Wyatt said. Wyatt found that doing schoolwork would make her less stressed as she would have the peace of mind that she would do well in her classes. "When you're ahead, you have less stress and that's a really big factor in my education. I learn better when I'm less stressed," Wyatt explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blazers put a lot of worth into productivity and spending every hour of the day getting something done. Students see actively finishing a task as more valuable than getting enough sleep, which is why many would not put sleep at the same level of importance as schoolwork or other responsibilities. "I would probably spend that time either doing homework or watching Netflix because those are things that I think I need to spend more time on. I will push myself to do that instead of actually sleeping," sophomore Tharindi Jayatilake says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But not all Blazers give in to this cycle of doing continuous work. Some would choose to spend their time relaxing and taking a break from everyday life. "Every hour of our day is spent doing something important or something related to school or something related to work. We don't get a lot of time to ourselves," junior Avi Kedia says. While students do understand the importance of schoolwork, some would choose to spend their extra hour doing something to destress from daily life. "I wouldn't put my extra hour into homework necessarily, I just want to relax," sophomore Anika Darbari says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Other Blazers would spend their extra time on social media or streaming sites. "I'd stay up and just go on Instagram or watch YouTube," freshman Nathan Hillman says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair students could choose to do many different things with their extra time, from doing homework to catching up on a TV series to looking at social media to sleeping. While it would be nice to dream about having an extra hour in the day, in the end, everybody still has the same 24 hours in the day as always. But getting that extra hour from daylight savings was a welcome break, and students have enjoyed spending that time doing whatever they thought was most important to them.</span></p>	32364
32196	The Blazers' overtime goal secured the victory	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair boys' soccer team (7-6) defeated the Paint Branch Panthers (1-11-1) in overtime by a score of 3-2 on Oct. 26. They will face Northwood (6-8) in the 4A North Region II championship on Oct. 29 at 7:15 p.m.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After 27 minutes passed in the first half, the Blazers struck first with a goal from sophomore forward Alexander Hernandez on a cross from sophomore defender Joao Gonzalez. The rest of the first half went scoreless, as Blair held the ball in their half most of the time. In the beginning of the second half, the Panthers would score, as senior goalkeeper Brennan Moore couldn't control the shot, tying the game up at 1-1. Just four minutes later, the Blazers would take the lead back after senior forward Natinael Tesfaw's shot was blocked but then rebounded and scored by senior defender Silas Reitsma. But, again, the Panthers would score a goal off a corner kick, knotting the teams back up at 2-2 with 20 minutes remaining in the second half. In the final 15 minutes of the game, Blair saw a few opportunities to win the game, but could not capitalize. Eventually, the game would go to overtime, as neither team could break the tie. The Blazers took just five minutes to score, as Tesfaw was able to sneak past the defender and finish, winning the game for the Blazers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The game-winning goal by Tesfaw secured the victory, and secured a regional championship berth for the Blazers. "It feels great, especially it being playoffs, our emotions are really high, obviously it's win or go home and I can barely describe how it feels to score and everyone running towards you, it feels amazing," Tesfaw said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32195"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair's defense was solid throughout the game. "The backline was absolutely solid. The goals were caused by silly mistakes off corners, but they couldn't make an effort on goal," junior defender Liben Schmidt said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers look to keep going in the playoffs on their road to the state championship. "We must humble ourselves because this will be a very emotional game and Northwood is looking to beat us," Schmidt said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers play their next playoff game at home against the Northwood Gladiators for the 4A North Region II championship on Oct. 29 at 7:15 p.m. The Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) Boys' Soccer Class 4A playoff bracket can be found </em><a href="https://mpssaa.countysports.zone/?bracket=1227" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>here.</em></a></p>	32195
32058	The Blazers won 2-1 in an exciting game filled with offensive opportunities.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair Blazers (4-1) dominated the field with a 2-1 victory over the Col. Zadok Magruder Colonels (0-4) on Sept. 13. Blair began putting on the pressure offensively early in the first half. Juniors Sophia Kim and Nieve Barry and sophomore Marlee Ginyard took several shots that either went wide or were saved by the Colonels’ goalie. Senior captains Janie Pitner and Rachel Dey both had goals from the edge of the 18-yard box, only for Magruder to respond with a goal of its own when Blair’s defense couldn’t get back in time. The Blazers led 2-1 at the end of the first half. Blair had many goal-scoring opportunities in the second half, but most of their shots missed high and wide. Magruder goalkeeper and captain Zena Baryoun also made lots of impressive saves, helping to keep the second half scoreless. Dey seemed content with the team's performance, and happy as well as a little surprised with her goal. "I didn't mean for [the ball] to go there, but I'm happy it did," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32057"></div><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Thursday, Sept. 26 against the Paint Branch Panthers at 7:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32057
31967	The rom-com ode to The Beatles is nothing special.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Thousands of teenage girls have dreamed about being a part of The Beatles since the group’s inception in 1960. </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yesterday</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> certainly tries to fulfill that fantasy on the big screen. However, a few too many cringey jokes, forced accidents and out-of-place celebrity appearances leave the movie falling a bit flat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The movie starts by introducing troubled musician Jack Malik (Himesh Patel), whose only fans are his mum, his three friends and his classmate-turned-manager Ellie (Lily James). On the night Jack is about to give up his singing career, the whole world’s power goes off for 12 seconds. During this time of total darkness, Jack gets hit by a bus and knocked out.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When he wakes up, he finds it strange that none of his friends remember The Beatles anymore. Confirmed by a Google search, Jack realizes that after the power outage, all traces of The Beatles, among other famous objects</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">,</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> have been wiped from people’s memories.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Seizing this fantastic opportunity, Jack starts to perform all of the songs by The Beatles and dubs them as his own songwriting. He starts by playing at local cafes and slowly gains traction. He goes on to start for Ed Sheeran’s tour and move to LA to generate success and fame.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yet, as Jack is moving up in fame, his deteriorating relationship with his long unfound crush, Ellie, and his lie-infused life, start to weigh him down. Now, Jack is left to navigate through these conflicting factors that fame brings.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The movie features classics such as “Yesterday,” “Let it Be,” “Back in the USSR” and “I Want To Hold Your Hand”. Although many potential viewers will be The Beatles fans, this movie does not seem to bring the nostalgia into the theater.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31966"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many other elements of the movie makes it a little off-putting. The humor, although intended to be cringey, often moves away from eye-rolling into plain old confusion. The humor also seems to milk Jack’s “ugly” appearance and facial expressions a little too much.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The plot also seems to be forced and fake at times. The power outage and crash that the whole story is hinged on are not fleshed out enough, leaving viewers painfully aware of the fakeness of it all. The event seemed strange and out of place, making it obvious that it was only for the advancement of the plot. The only excuse for the major accident was a mumble about an old superstition.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many parts of the movie almost seem to degrade The Beatles. The film tries too hard to compact all of The Beatles’ hard work and success into one overnight viral Internet story, belittling all of the hard work and struggles the Beatles had to overcome to produce these top hits. The celebrity appearances from Ed Sheeran and James Corden are an effort to make the 1960s rock band relatable to Generation Z, but only serve to bring The Beatles down to a level of generic pop music and scripted talk show hosts.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The relationship between Ellie and Jack was endearing, awkward, cute and the best part about the movie. It was like any other modern rom-com relationship, plus a little bit more. Ellie’s character helped to show Jack’s humble nature and develop one of the only conflicts in the plot.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If you are looking for a fun, modern rom-com with a dash of fun and songs by The Beatles on the side, this is the movie for you. Even if the movie is a little disappointing to a diehard Beatles fan, nobody can deny singing along to some of the world’s greatest hits. Just don’t be expected to be moved to tears or amazed. In fact, you will probably forget </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yesterday</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> tomorrow.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yesterday is rated PG-13 for suggestive content and language and is now Playing at Regal Cinemas Rockville Center 13, ArcLight Cinemas and Rio Cinemas 18.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31966
33169	Even with the mediocre opening weekend of Mulan’s live-action, Disney plans to launch a remake of The Little Mermaid next year.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the wake of live-action Mulan’s less than stellar opening weekend on Sept. 11 at the box office, </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2020/09/20/disney-mulan-2020-china-box-office-flop/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">raking in $20 million less than analyst predictions</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, old Disney fanatics and new fans alike are all asking one question: should Disney stop making live-action remakes of their animated classics?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Following the backlash concerning Mulan lead actress Liu YiFei’s </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49373276" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">comments of support</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for the Hong Kong police, the controversial live action remake became available for streaming on Disney+ on Sept. 4 and hit mainland China theaters a week later. Besides the controversy surrounding Liu, </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2020/09/20/disney-mulan-2020-china-box-office-flop/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">critics berated</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> the movie for poor character development, plot holes, and historical inaccuracy. The disappointing debut was accredited to piracy and early bad reviews.The live action remake also had substantial differences from its animated counterpart, mainly cutting out Mushu and the iconic song lineup in order to make the film more “historically realistic, </span><a href="https://dailybruin.com/2020/02/28/recent-rewinds-live-action-mulan-sacrifices-mushu-and-music-for-cultural-accuracy-realism" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">'' according to the Daily Bruin</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Disney’s history with remakes dates back to 1994 with “</span><a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/1994s-the-jungle-book-the-forgotten-first-disney-live-action-remake" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">The Jungle Book</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">” during the </span><a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/nine-eras-disney-animation" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Disney Renaissance Era.</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Since then, Disney remade some of its most famous animations from its </span><a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/nine-eras-disney-animation" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Silver and Renaissance Age</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> with considerable success.

These remakes ushered in the Second Disney Renaissance (2010 - Present), giving them the capital to make new movies such as “Moana (2016)” and “Frozen (2013).”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior David Diouf agrees that animated remakes bring in a sizable chunk of profit for Disney. “These movies bring in a heavy amount of revenue, because they mostly feature A-list celebrities. So the way I see it, there is a big financial incentive,” Diouf says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33168"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although the latest live-action movie “Mulan” did not live up to its promises, people are divided about whether or not Disney should keep remaking their animated movies. Diouf believes that remaking animated movies will eventually get old. “I feel as though Disney’s power lies in the fact that they create these unique stories that transcend generations. Remaking old movies can only bring them so far,” Diouf says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Critics agree with that idea, noting that Disney remakes aren’t good because they don’t have to be. “They all have the same problem: a robotic devotion to the animated film that came before it. Because of this, they’re less like movies and more like concerts, except you’re going to an arena to see a cover band, and they’re not even that good,” </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450999/disney-remakes-live-action-plus-animation" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">ScreenCrush’s John Speigel writes.&nbsp;</a></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Aileen Qi, on the other hand, believes that Disney remakes can spur on feminism for younger generations. “Personally, I don’t think the live-action remakes are bad. My favorites would be Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast, as they put an emphasis on female empowerment, which I think is a good thing,” Qi stated.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whether or not you believe live-action remakes are Disney’s perfect formula, Disney just released a multitude of future live-action remakes from </span><a href="https://collider.com/upcoming-live-action-disney-movies-release-dates/#the-little-mermaid" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Peter Pan to Snow White</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.

32578	Hello there, fellow Good Place Geeks, and welcome to episode 3 of the Goodcast!	<p>Hello there, fellow Good Place Geeks, and welcome to episode 3 of the Goodcast! We're Vivian and Shifra, and we're here to tell you all about Chapter 50 of the Good Place on NBC, titled "Mondays, Am I Right?" If you're new to the show, be sure to check out episode 1, where we give you a recap of all the seasons so far, and if you didn't catch chapter 49, head over to episode 2 for our summary and analysis. As always, there will be some spoilers. If you're fine with that, sit back and relax!&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32577"></div><p><strong>Full transcript:</strong></p><p>The Bad Place demons haven’t tortured in weeks, and they're invited to a special meeting, where Michael announces that he and Shawn are planning to work together and redesign the Bad Place. Instead of physical torture, humans take psychological tests targeted toward their worst traits on Earth until they pass with a full score and proceed to the Good Place. As Michael walks them through this new mode of psychological torture with Tahani as a sample subject, Vicky shows up on the scene and instantly succeeds at replicating the experiment that Michael envisions. Plagued by his own insecurity and distrust for Vicky, he kicks her off the team. However, Janet and Michael convince him that even though Vicky might be too good at helping him achieve his current goal, he'll still have a purpose afterward. Michael convinces Vicky to rejoin the team by staging her fake takeover of the project, ultimately giving her full creative control.</p><p>Then comes my favorite part of the entire episode: Vicky and Michael stage a coup with laughably bad acting so that Michael can give the project to Vicky without suspicion. Vicky almost leads Michael into a West Side Story dance battle, but Michael runs out of the room and cuts off the scene because he's too embarrassed. The bad acting works, because the other architects are convinced, but I'm still very sad that we didn't get to see the dance battle.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Eleanor and Chidi start reading the files of everyone in the universe to find the first 1,000 people suitable for the project, but they become insecure of whether they're really "good" enough for each other. Eleanor fears Chidi will disapprove of her selfish actions on Earth, but Chidi reassures her that he loves her and appreciates her growth, especially in the conditions that she grew up in. However, Chidi becomes insecure that Eleanor might eventually get bored of him.&nbsp;</p><p>And then is my favorite part of the episode, where Jason tricks Chidi into giving himself advice. When Chidi reveals to Jason that he feels he and Eleanor are too different for her to truly enjoy his company for eternity, Jason pretends to be hurt by the idea that he might be too boring for Janet. Chidi later finds Jason and comforts him. In the words of Chidi, "The relationship you've built is wonderful. She knows you and loves you, and that's all that matters." Within seconds, Jason bursts into laughter and explains that Chidi already knew the truth about his relationship with Eleanor; he just needs to tell himself what he just told Jason. Personally, I live for the moments when Jason's wisdom shines through— it's a delightful complement to his usual gags.</p><p>At the end of the episode, the squad is seen 1.28 Jeremy Bearimy's into the future, where their new system is off to a great start. Then, Michael tells the four that they've made it to the Good Place by saving all of humanity, and they ride off in a golden hot air balloon.</p><p>At the risk of being sappy for a second, I think this episode showed us two very important things. First, everybody goes through periods of not feeling good enough, like when Michael doesn't want his project to succeed so quickly because he fears that he'll lose his purpose, or when Chidi and Eleanor each don't believe they're good enough for the other. But ultimately, we all matter and are loved! Second, like the gang of humans proved with their ascent in the hot air balloon, we really can become better even if we start out with flaws. So if you're trying to break a bad habit, use this episode as motivation that it's entirely possible to help others and, no matter the stumbles along the way, truly become a better person :)&nbsp;</p><p>What's great about the Good Place is that despite it being a genuinely entertaining show at the surface level, the writing is also packed with really interesting ideological commentary. There's an overarching message of emphasizing self-love and self improvement, but I also appreciated the small detail that Tahani adds in at the beginning of the episode when explaining the new system to the Bad Place demons. While they initially resist change, claiming that "that's the way it's always been done," Tahani quickly explains that it's hardly a proper excuse. In her words, "'It's the way it's always been done' is an excuse that's been used for hundreds of years to justify racism and misogyny."</p><p>Unconfident Chidi came back for a second and it was slightly scary — maybe that's a tactic the writers will use going forward. Everything seems perfect right now, with the humans getting into the Good Place, but maybe they want to worry us by having each character's flaws creep back in here and there.The characters have certainly grown, but it's totally realistic for someone to slip back into an old habit, and it shouldn't be taken as a sign of weakness.</p><p>I think there's been a lot of character development in this episode, with Michael and Chidi, but also Vicky and Shawn from the Bad Place. They seem to be fully on board with the new plan, and I'm honestly surprised at the few objections that they've brought up. It's very uncharacteristic of Shawn to simply sit back and watch people move into the good place. Can we trust him in these final episodes? Can we trust Vicky? Can we trust the regular demons? I mean, the new system has already come to fruition, but it seemed like a rather quick switch to me. What do you predict going into the last few episodes, Shifra? Is it neatly wrapping up, or should we still be on edge? I mean, they're in the Good Place already.</p><p>On a lighter note, this episode was filled with lots of adorable references to everyday human life. Is there going to be a hilariously bad pop song parody in every episode? Last week we had Judge Gen's "Erase the Earth" and this week we were graced with Janet's "Simply the Test! Better than all the rest!" I don't have guesses as to what next week's song will be but I hope we see it. Also, when Janet is trying to convince Michael of his self-worth, she admits that she was trying to learn something once and had to ask Alexa. I think I would much rather have a Janet than an Alexa, if I could choose. Me too. Vicky also talked about going to ice-cold yoga, in an apparent nod to the trend of hot yoga.&nbsp;</p><p>They also stuck in a great reference to the classic "A few seconds later" or "A few decades later" Spongebob transition that's now become a pop culture meme. I really loved the Good Place's spin on the addition of "1.28 Jeremy Bearimy's later" as a transition into the future!</p><p>And now, drumroll please *cue Vivian drumroll* it's time for the tweet segment of the Goodcast! Before ending for the week, we want to grace you with a couple of our favorite tweets about Thursday's episode. Number one is from user @lilyphanstuff, who said, "People need to stop being mean to Jason.. He reads some books! Hop off! Best character ever!" I agree — our favorite Floridian proved that he knows his Romeo and Juliet! Only Jason Mendoza could slip in a reference to the Montagues and Capulets in such a funny way. And number two is from @thegoodplacenbc itself, concerning chainsaw bears, which the Bad Place architects seem to be obsessed with as a torture device, despite Michael's insistence that they don't worked. Along with a gif of Tahani coming face-to-face with one, they wrote, "So a chainsaw bear walks into a party…" Absurd torture tactics make for good joke material.&nbsp;</p><p>So, despite what seemed like hundreds of diversions along the way, it looks like we'll finally see the REAL Good Place next week. Until then, we can only hope that there's some good stuff in store for all of us. On that note, we're signing off. Be sure to follow @mbhssco on Twitter and keep up with at at scoop.mbhs.edu to catch the next installment of the Goodcast! Thanks for listening.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	32517
32063	The Blazers improve their record to 5-2 in a blowout win over the Trojans	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair Blazers (5-2) defeated the Gaithersburg Trojans (1-1) 10-1 in a blowout on Sept. 20. The Blazers put up an impressive display of offensive strength in the first half. Sophomore Marlee Ginyard scored off of a cross by senior captain Noa Dorah while Dorah had a nice shot of her own into the lower left corner to give Blair a 2-0 lead. Goals by juniors Emilie Vigliotta and Sophia Kim, a free kick by senior Bianca Martinez-Penn that Gaithersburg’s goalie dropped and another goal by senior captain Janie Pitner left the Blazers leading 6-0 at the end of the first half. Blair kept their momentum going through the start of the second half. Ginyard tapped the ball in behind the goalie for her second goal of the game. Gaithersburg rallied to score their first goal on a free kick. Blair responded with a goal by junior Nieve Barry, assisted by freshman Magda Goles, and another goal by Kim. Junior Seren Sarkozy-Banocsy brought Blair to 10 with a goal from deep that went over the Trojan goalie’s head. Blair ended up on top with a score of 10-1. Kim thought that it was one of the best games the Blazers have played this season. "We connected passes well and we had good combinations," she said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32062"></div><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game against the Paint Branch Panthers on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 7:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32062
32663	How McAuliff braved the winter cold during her week-long protest	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After school ends, junior Jordan McAuliff puts on layer after layer, preparing to spend the night in a place without heat. As the sun sets and the night turns colder, McAuliff completes her homework by lantern. She then prepares to brave the cold of sleeping in an unheated boat cabin in early December. This was how McAuliff spent her week living on a boat in protest of the climate crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From Dec. 2 to Dec. 6, McAuliff lived on a boat to advocate for climate activism. Planning her protest only a month ahead, she hoped to bring a greater focus on climate change. "I did this because I feel this really strong sense of pressure and dread and anxiety around the climate crisis every single day," McAuliffe says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32662"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff became motivated to protest after returning from a climate activism event.&nbsp;"I had been talking to another young activist at this protest, who was talking about some of the personal things that she was going to do in her community and that really inspired me to say that I wanted to make this personal sacrifice," McAuiff says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After brainstorming ideas on how to protest, McAuliff decided to live on a boat, feeling it represented a possible future reality. "I decided to live on a boat because the boat for me symbolizes the fact that the waters are rising," McAuliff says. She also has a personal connection to this protest, since her father lived on a boat growing up, and taught McAuliff many ideals reflected in her climate activism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff's father told her that during his time as a lifeguard, the people who needed to be rescued were not those who could not swim, but rather those who swam out too far. McAuliff carries that same sentiment with her climate activism. "That's where the world is right now on climate, because we've gone too far out and soon we're not going to be able to go back and there isn't going to be anyone to rescue us," she explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff bought the boat online with the help of her family. "Jordan found someone who could give the boat to her and I helped her with the paperwork and whatnot so that she could transfer it legally to her name," Michael McAuliff, Jordan McAuliff's father, says. Jordan McAuliff is grateful for the help she received from her friends and family, as they have not only helped her with the financial parts of the protest but also stayed with her for long periods of time when she was living on the boat to ensure her safety. "My parents and my uncle especially were really big helpers, as far as staying there when it was really late, moving the boat and giving me last minute support I needed. My fellow hub leaders also took shifts with me when I was asleep, until midnight when one of my parents would come," McAuliff explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff's parents were supportive of her protest, but wanted to make sure that she stayed safe throughout the week. "We were willing to let her do this protest but we weren't going to send her off into the night by herself. So she organized a lot of nighttime watches so that there was always somebody with her or right outside," Michael McAuliff says. While the supervision did make McAuliff's family feel better about her protest, they still worried over McAuliff's wellbeing during the week. "Mostly I was just concerned that she'd be cold and hungry in there because it's not a comfortable environment during the winter with no heat," Michael McAuliff says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32661"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During the week, Jordan McAuliff struggled to balance her schoolwork and her protest. While she feels it did not impact her grades in the long term, she realizes how lucky she is to be able to do her schoolwork easily. "I had to juggle changing into my warm clothes before I left at the end of the day and doing my homework by trying to connect to a mobile hotspot or using a lantern. It definitely made me more conscious of my own privilege," McAuliff says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff is also a leader of the local </span><a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Sunrise</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> hub, which is part of a movement dedicated to getting young people to protest against the climate crisis. As a local leader, she felt it was important for her to show she was dedicated to her cause. "This was proving through an act of personal sacrifice, that if I'm going to ask you to make sacrifices for the movement, I need to show you first how committed I am," McAuliff explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff briefly brought the boat to Blair, filming a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/sunriseslvrsprg/status/1201624159702441984" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">video</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> about her goal for the protest on the local Sunrise hub Twitter. After, she parked the boat in a neighborhood near Blair so she could still walk to school. She updated followers on Twitter about her status throughout the week not only on how she was doing, but also on why she was leading her protest and giving thanks to those who helped out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While McAuliff was open to coverage on her protest, she did not actively seek out news outlets. "I specifically chose not to reach out to national press because I didn't want people to think that I was doing it just to get my name in the news," McAuliff explains. News organizations such as Vice and Capital News Service did report on her protest, but had reached out to McAuliff first. "She was more interested in having her classmates aware of it than having a greater sort of media impact because she wasn't after that," Michael McAuliff says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jordan McAuliff ended her protest on the day of a national strike on climate issues, hoping to put emphasis not only on her protest but on ones happening across the nation. "[My protest] started on Dec. 2, and led up to Dec. 6, which was a day of a national climate strike in a lot of other cities across the country," McAuliff says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">McAuliff hopes that her protest will lead to more people speaking out against climate change in the future. "We can't keep going about business as usual, we have to stand up and make a really bold statement about this before it's too late because we're running out of time," McAuliff says.</span></p>	32662
33245	Blazers react to the insurrection that took place at the Capitol	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/12/us/capitol-mob-timeline.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Wednesday</a>,<span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> January 6, while Congress was in session to certify the election of Joe Biden as President, a group of President Donald Trump's supporters broke into the Capitol Building, forcing Congress into a lockdown. Blazers all throughout the community were completely shocked as they watched the events unfold.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/12/us/capitol-mob-timeline.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">New York Times</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, the insurrection at the Capitol followed a speech in which President Trump called on a crowd of supporters (which included members of the “Proud Boys” group) to “show strength” and “walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.” In total, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/us/who-died-in-capitol-building-attack.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">5 people died, including a Capitol Police officer.</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While news outlets have struggled to find the proper term to characterize the events, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-capitol-siege-riots-media-8000ce7db2b176c1be386d945be5fd6a" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">ranging from “riot” to “insurrection” to “attempted coup,”</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> many in the Blair community had strong opinions about what they felt the events should or should not be called. Blair AP World History teacher Kenneth Seat knows most of all what they cannot be considered. “Breaking into one of the most secure buildings in the United States, you can’t just call that a protest...some of them, perhaps could be considered domestic terrorists,” Seat said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair teacher Andrea Maples, who teaches Law &amp; Administration of Justice and a former lawyer of 7 years herself, agrees with Seat. “I think it’s more appropriately characterized as riots...I think that those who stormed the capitol were absolutely not protesting….at least not in the sense of a constitutional sense, you know your first amendment right to peacefully protest. I think they had a completely different thing in mind,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair Senior Dawit Seifu struggled to find the words to describe the events. “I don’t think there is one word that can actually, you know...cover the magnitude of what they did...But what I can say is that this is unheard of.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair Social Studies teacher Ronda Ravilious was also deeply disturbed by the events. “Nothing that would contribute to the good that was involved in this protest. And the people who were involved were driven by...deep hatred and anger,” Ravilious said. Ravilious later concurred that “protest” was not the appropriate term for the events.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While Seat noted some of his students made comparisons between the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, he iterated that the two series of events are extremely different. “I don’t think you can really compare them...‘Black Lives Matter’ protests and other civil rights protests throughout history, the goal is to try and increase democracy, increase participation and bring more rights to people whose rights may have been neglected,” Seat said. “The events on Wednesday were basically people who were not accepting of the democratic process...trying to destroy our democratic traditions.".&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ravilious also noted how she was troubled by the stark differences between the treatment of the group that broke into the capitol and Black Lives Matter protesters. “The mob, the violent, angry swell that really consumed the capital, was really treated in a very different way than when you have other types of legitimate peaceful protest, such as the ‘Black Lives Matter’ protest. That’s also a distinguishing factor that we can’t ignore,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Seifu was also frustrated by the disparity in the severity of responses. “When it was about ‘Black Lives Matter,’ you know, they were being shot with rubber bullets. Here, there wasn’t that much of that,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maples added her disbelief to the difference in reaction by law enforcement. “There definitely was not equity in how these people were treated compared to Black Lives Matter protesters in the summer,” Maples said. “My biggest question I guess, in this regard is why weren’t there more police, national guardsmen there to begin with...I completely can’t understand it..It’s either complete incompetence... or it’s gross negligence. Or there’s complicity there, which I hope it’s not that,” Maples said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Seat offered what he believed to be one of the potential causes of the insurrection. “I think they were egged on by the President who said that they would not accept defeat, that no one should accept defeat. And this was sort of the logical conclusion if you don’t accept defeat,” Seat said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following the swearing-in of Joe Biden as President of the United States, Seifu has hope for the future. “I’m rooting for Biden. These next four years, I hope that he’s able to bring as much change as possible,” Seifu said. Yet, he also had another message for his fellow young Blazers as they head into a new era. “Let’s not live in the mistakes of our ancestors, still dealing with the same problems year after year, decade after decade, generation after generation. Let’s leave racism with the millenials. Let it not carry down to Gen Z, because if it carries down to us, then the generation that comes after us is gonna have to deal with our mess, with our BS.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“So I am asking that we all stand together, that we all stand hand-in-hand. Let’s work, let’s love on each other. Let’s say ‘your people are my people’...Let’s not create divisions on some silly stuff like race, color, gender, religion, anything. Let’s all love one another. Let’s all say...“We are all Americans, we are all one.” </span></p>	33244
32131	Blair’s Entrepreneurship Academy provides some of the best learning opportunities in the nation	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“If you have an open space in your schedule, or even if you don’t have an open space in your schedule, I would advise changing one of your classes to entrepreneurship,” junior Karandeep Singh says. Singh is advocating for Blair’s Entrepreneurship Academy, one of the 5 academies at Blair.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The entrepreneurship program gives students who are interested in business a chance to prepare for college, offering classes in entrepreneurship, marketing and accounting. Students take three business-related courses, complete a culminating capstone and graduate the program with an academy certificate and tassel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The entrepreneurship academy is about more than just mundane textbook work; elective classes are structured around developing an actual business. Students take the entrepreneurship class first, spending the year creating a business plan which is presented to a panel of judges at the end of the year. The judges will pick two proposals to go onto the city, state and national level with the winner receiving a grant for their business idea.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The second tier is the marketing class where students learn how to expand their business beyond the local area. The third and final accounting elective teaches students budgeting and finances.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In senior year, students complete a capstone project. Capstones may consist of taking a college business class, participating in a competition or interning at a company. For all their dedication and hard work, students receive an academy certificate and tassel during graduation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s entrepreneurship academy is one of the most successful high school business programs in the nation and has received many international titles. At the head of the success is lead teacher Kevin Murley. Murley completed graduate school at Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University, and he has been teaching as the head teacher of the entrepreneurship academy at Blair for over 15 years. </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">In conjunction with teaching at Blair, over the summer, Murley teaches finance seminars at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Throughout his years as head teacher of the entrepreneurship academy, Murley has sent numerous students to New York City as finalists for the </span><a href="http://nfte.com" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">NFTE </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">business plan competition. He has also had students win international investing competitions through the University of Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Murley says that his prior experience working at marketing and international business firms is what sets his students apart from others on the national scale. “I’m an unusual teacher in that I have real business experience, not just educational experience,” Murley says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32130"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Murley not only prepares his students for college, but also gives them substantial opportunities and internships in high school. Through the academy program, Murley helps young entrepreneurs launch their own businesses, manage their personal life &amp; finances and intern at a variety of companies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Inside the classroom, Murley organizes field trips for job shadowings at renowned companies. One of the most notable examples is the annual trip to the test kitchens of HMSHost in Bethesda where students present proposals to the company and see how the kitchens run.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Singh has found his passion and career path through the entrepreneurship academy. Singh has a business in retail arbitrage: he buys shoes for retail prices, waits for them to go out of stock and sells the shoes for a higher mark-up price. “Before the entrepreneurship class, I was really unorganized, and I only sold one pair every two weeks. Right now, I’m selling two pairs every two days, and sometimes, there will be a week where I get a return of $1200 profit,” Singh says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Singh accredits his rise in success to Murley and the classes the entrepreneurship academy offers, “there’s a mentality that you are always putting information in your head, even if you are not studying for it. This class will teach you skills that no other class can teach you. Even though it is made for business, it will teach you how to manage your own money and value everything in your life,” Singh concludes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the end of the day, Murley emphasizes that business is for everyone and seen everywhere, “business is where you bring everything you learn in other classes together in a real world application that impacts everything that is going on around you in the world today. If business doesn’t evolve, people don’t have jobs. Business is interconnected with all fields: science, psychology, english, climate change, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">everything</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">,” Murley states.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whether you are interested in stocks or the art of selling shoes, the entrepreneurship academy will not only teach you how to make money. The skills you learn will stay with you for your entire lifetime.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Read more about Mr. Kevin Murley </em><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/murley-kevin-26091/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>here</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32130

A message of independence and self-empowerment features prominently in Grande's lyrics, as she sings with joy from overcoming the emotional trauma caused by the death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller and her break-up with comedian Pete Davidson. </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NASA</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is a song about needing space from a man; Grande sings, "Baby, you know time apart is beneficial / It's like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A." Her song </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">7 rings</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> was inspired by the rings she bought for six of her friends, symbolizing the commitment she makes to her friends as opposed to a romantic partner.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31714"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Million Miles — Molly Tuttle</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Guitarist and songwriter Molly Tuttle released her new song </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Million Miles </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">on February 15. Songwriters Steve Poltz and Jewel began writing </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Million Miles</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> more than 20 years ago, and Tuttle was introduced to the song during a writing session with Poltz. Tuttle, who dabbles in folk, bluegrass and Americana music, croons over a light acoustic melody: "</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">If you were here / You'd be my lifeboat / Save me but / You're a million miles away." The song's country vibes bring back memories from the old days.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Helium — HOMESHAKE</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Homeshake, a musician based out of Montreal, Canada, released his fourth full-length album, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Helium</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, on February 15. Homeshake has said he wants his music to be relaxing, and he succeeded on that front with this album, which mixes lo-fi R&amp;B instrumentals with soft vocals. The songs have a dreamy quality; his lyrics talk about technology, solitude and fantasy distancing him from reality. In the upbeat R&amp;B track </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Anything at All</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, he sings, "</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Everyone I know / Lives in my cell phone / I should probably put this down / I don't need a thing right now."

The album draws inspiration from Lavigne's battle with Lyme disease, with which she was diagnosed in 2014. The album's lead single of the same name is a pop rock song backed by piano, strings, synths and thunderous drums. The entire album is united by a common theme of fighting back and staying strong, as shown in </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Head Above Water</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">'s lyrics: "</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for / Can't part the sea, can't reach the shore / And my voice becomes the driving force / I won't let this pull me overboard."</span></p>	31714
32781	The Blazers start playoffs strong with a 53-41 victory over the Blue Devils	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (14-8) beat the Springbrook Blue Devils (4-19) by a score of 53-41 on Feb. 28. The Blazers had a strong offensive showing, which played a major role in their victory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair started the night strong with four baskets by junior guard Kate Hildebrandt and multiple free throws in the first quarter. However, they began to lose their control in the second quarter, allowing the Blue Devils to quickly retaliate. Bad passes and hasty shots by the Blazers gave possessions to Springbrook and allowed them to score. Additionally, there were many instances where the Blazers took shots from one extreme side of the basket, but didn’t have anyone to rebound on the other side when the shots went long. This gave Springbrook rebounds and additional scoring opportunities. These little mistakes kept the game close, with Blair trailing 21-20 at halftime.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32780"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The third quarter was tense for both sides as each struggled to pull ahead. The score was tied four times throughout the quarter, until Blair finally pulled ahead to 31-30. Once Blair gained that lead, they didn’t look back. Strong passes, aggressive rebounds and extra energy kept the Blazers on top.&nbsp;“We weren’t scared of anything. We drove with confidence and we just finished,” Hildebrandt said. A collective 22 points in the fourth quarter secured Blair’s 53-41 victory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Compared to previous games, the Blazers' defense and offense were both on point this time around. Hildebrant’s 17 points, senior captain and guard Zoe Abramson’s 13 points, and freshman guard Natalie Frost’s 12 points helped propel Blair on the scoreboard. On the defense front, senior guard-forward Lucy Martin, sophomore guard-forward Sayara Thomas and freshman guard Amelia Martin got a collective total of 14 defensive rebounds. Abramson described the defense strategy and how it improved throughout the night. “I think at the beginning we struggled, but switching up into a zone helped us bring up our energy level. Going back to a man-to-man defense, we really worked on trapping the drives and making sure that they couldn’t get open shots,” she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Abramson also explained how the team kept spirits high, despite the lead changing hands multiple times. “It was just knowing we weren’t going to accept losing. We did not want to lose to Springbrook. We knew we had to get a couple more points than them, so we just focused on that,” she concluded.&nbsp;</span></p>	32780
31990	The movie's narration by a dog falls short of successful	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Show, don't tell. The elementary adage from English class shines through in the new film </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Art of Racing in the Rain</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. A movie told from a dog's point of view— prior to walking into the theater, the premise already prompts skepticism. The idea seems to limit opportunities for cinematic intricacies such as character development and nuanced interactions. Watching the movie confirmed those speculations: it lacked depth, as expected.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31989"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Directed by Simon Curtis, </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Art of Racing in the Rain</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> tells the story of Denny (Milo Ventimiglia), an aspiring Formula 1 race car driver, and his faithful sidekick Enzo (Kevin Costner). Together, they battle the obstacles that life hurls in their direction, from staying motivated in the racing industry to struggling to keep a family together. Enzo, a lab-terrier mix, sticks by Denny as he builds relationships with his girlfriend-turned-wife Eve (Amanda Seyfried) and their daughter Zoe (Ryan Kiera Armstrong).</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Starting off on an odd foot, the opening scene depicts a dejected dog wetting himself on the doormat. Enzo's raspy, middle-aged voice rises from the darkness of the screen. The monotony blossoms as Enzo narrates his life story, from his adoption until Denny and Eve are mid-marriage and the main plot finally begins. The movie's storytelling is left to Enzo's narration, though some dialogue is interspersed through the scenes. As a result, the audience is left to watch the action from the sidelines.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The best scenes found Enzo's thoughts taking a backseat to the main plot of the movie. But the brief moments of dialogue and the tension subtly bubbling between characters were too few, and the movie inevitably returned to Enzo's limited perspective and prevented the natural unfolding of events.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There were also times when Enzo's point of view seemed to be a convenient excuse to avoid filming extra scenes, especially emotional ones. Spoiler alert: Eve develops a cancerous brain tumor and spends months in the hospital, but we never get to see her deterioration or the anguishing interactions that may have occurred there.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While Enzo's perspective is limiting, his personality successfully embodied that of a spirited and trusting pet. He longs for a human tongue to voice his ideas and human thumbs to hold the wheel of a race car. Ultimately, he seeks to serve his purpose as a dog in a variety of comedic ways.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The development of the other characters' personalities left much to be appreciated as well. The determined and deeply-caring Denny juggles investing time in his competitive career and supporting his family. The even stronger Eve, battling disease at home, shows Denny a resilient face to prevent him from sacrificing his dream. Even the turbulent dynamic between Eve's parents, who are terse toward Denny, unravels as Eve's mother learns to stand up to her husband's lies.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The telling of this story as opposed to its "showing" had evident disadvantages, but </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Art of Racing in the Rain</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> was still a pleasant viewing overall. Curtis does a superb job of developing the audience's relationship to each character, creating genuine and heartfelt reactions for their losses.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“The Art of Racing in the Rain” is rated PG for thematic material and is playing at AMC Wheaton Mall 9 and ArcLight Cinemas Bethesda. </em></p>	31989
32739	Worrell becomes the first Blair player since Brian Magner in the 1970s to reach 1,000 varsity career points	<p>Blair junior guard Alfred Worrell notched 1,000 varsity career points in a win over Whitman on Feb. 21. The previous boys' varsity basketball player to surpass this 1,000 point benchmark was Brian Magner, who played in the 1970s. Worrell has been on the varsity team since his freshman year, and has been a starter since the midway point of his sophomore year.</p><p>Going into the game, Worrell was just 19 points away from 1,000, but he didn't feel nervous to reach the milestone. "I didn't feel any pressure, I just looked at it as a regular game, I played my game, and I let the game come to me," Worrell said.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32738"></div><p>Worrell prides himself on how hard he works during the off-season, and even during the season, so to reach this impressive milestone is rewarding. "It feels really good... I worked really hard in the summer, just started playing basketball in the eighth grade pretty much, and every summer, no one believed in me so I just took that chip on my shoulder and just kept working, and I'm going to keep on working," Worrell said.</p><p>Worrell was playing for more than himself during that game. Over the summer, his brother tragically passed away. Ever since, Worrell has been inspired to be the best he can be. "I did it for my brother pretty much, I knew I was gonna hit it. In the warm up lines I wore my brother's shirt, and it felt really good to get it for him," Worrell said.</p><p><em>Blair's boys' varsity basketball lost their first round playoff game against Paint Branch on Feb. 27 by a score of 61-54.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32738
32322	The healthier options are just one step in the right direction	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In October, Blair acquired six new vending machines with healthier options as part of the Be Well 365 Initiative, a countywide program to "</span><a href="https://news.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/staff-bulletin/be-well-365-launches-to-address-student-well-being/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">address</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> the physical, social and psychological well-being of students," according to Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS). The machines were supplied by </span><a href="https://vendnatural.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Vend Natural</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, an Annapolis-based company that specializes in "[providing] customers with delicious, high quality products at affordable prices." From Popcorners to Nature's Garden trail mix, the vending machines provide students with snacks that are better for them than traditional vending machine food.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Principal Renay Johnson introduced the change in an Instagram </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3FOAMih3oD/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">post</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that received mixed responses. Some members of the Blair community were seemingly appreciative of the new machines, citing the benefits of healthy foods. Others — like freshman Sarbani Poulsen, who wrote "I just want my peanut M&amp;Ms back" — expressed their frustration over the changes. Regardless of differing student opinions, the new vending machines are a commendable first step toward Blair's emphasis on wellness, but, like all first steps, they have weaknesses that must be kept on users' radars.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The biggest difference between the old and new machines is the absence of candy and chocolate. Snickers bars, Skittles and similar offerings are no longer available. However much disappointment the decision brought on, eliminating candy is a positive step toward student wellness. Dr. Chana Kraus-Friedberg, liaison librarian for Michigan State University's Masters in Public Health program, </span><a href="https://education.seattlepi.com/can-eating-foods-containing-sugar-affect-students-health-school-performance-2173.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">emphasizes</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that "children's school performance is impacted by their sugar consumption in a few ways," noting that empty calorie consumption and sugar crashes harm students' ability to focus. Making sweets less accessible to students in a school environment is likely to present improvements in both their physical and mental health.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Of course, an occasional dessert does not detract from students' health or ability to focus in the long term. Administrators took that into account in selecting products for the new machines, providing several healthier versions of old snacks. Whole grain Pop Tarts, among the new offerings, are slightly </span><a href="https://www.nutritionix.com/i/kelloggs/whole-grain-pop-tarts-fudge/55f82f4cdcfdd0d70c08e38a" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">lower</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in caloric, fat and sugar content than the previously-offered regular Pop Tarts. Therefore, they prevent students who want sweets from consuming as many empty calories while still giving them a sugar fix. Buzz Strong's chocolate chip cookies, also in the new machines, are yet another example. The </span><a href="https://www.fooducate.com/product/Buzz-Strongs-Bakery-Chocolate-Chip-Cookie/59E8F6AC-5947-A09E-4F3A-99FBCDEA3798" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">cookies</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> are high in fiber and have a lower sugar content than regular cookies.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the old machines only allowed cash payment, the new machines also accept card or electronic payment, allowing for a wider range of Blair students to take advantage of the healthier options. The rollout of the new payment options was faulty —&nbsp;students who tried to use systems like Apple Pay initially received extra service charges on items — but MCPS' Central Office fixed any issues, according to Johnson.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32321"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the increase in nutritious snacks that the new vending machines have brought, they do have some imperfections and should by no means be the only step in Blair's commitment to health. Several of the snacks for sale in the machines, while healthier than what was previously offered, are still not the best options for student well-being. The crunchy Nature Valley granola bars offered, for example, are "far from </span><a href="https://www.thedailymeal.com/healthy-eating/healthiest-and-unhealthiest-snack-bars-slideshow/slide-10" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">natural</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">" and contain a significant amount of added sugar ingredients. The available Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal bars may encourage students who do not otherwise eat breakfast to do so, but they are highly processed and contain several controversial </span><a href="https://www.fooducate.com/product/Cinnamon-Toast-Crunch-Cereal-Bar/382BF3EA-36AC-11E3-A74D-1E047F0525AB" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">additives</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> such as Maltodextrin and the potentially-carcinogenic BHT.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When consumed in excess, maltodextrin "may lead to an increased glycemic load and therefore post meal glycaemia, which are viewed as less desirable for health," </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4940893/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">says</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Maastricht University's Dr. Denise L. Hofman. Although the new vending machine snacks do not pose major health risks when consumed in moderation, students who may misinterpret their "healthy" branding and eat them too often may see negative long-term effects.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Staff do acknowledge the downfalls. "Even though [the machines] are not 100 percent healthy, they're better than what we had before," Johnson explains. While Blair unfortunately does not have plans to offer completely healthy snacks to students in the near future, Johnson does bring up the valid point that the school cafeteria offers those already. "We have items available in the cafeteria, and we never sell out of apples and oranges and bananas," she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a school aiming to focus on health, Blair should be applauded for installing new vending machines and encouraging Blazers to eat healthier snacks that are more conducive to their well-being and classroom performance. They should also not be afraid to continue to take steps to promote health, including raising awareness about snacks that may look healthy but are not the best for students. Some student backlash should be expected, but Blazers should remember that vending machines are simply one of many food options. By acknowledging both the positives and negatives of the machines, Blair will demonstrate a sustained, genuine commitment to student wellness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32321
33320	Boris and Andrea are physical therapists who are designated as essential workers. They have continued helping their patients throughout the pandemic, despite the health risks.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From doctors to grocery workers to child care professionals, essential workers have helped us all throughout the past 11 months.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Boris and Andrea are both physical therapists that work in Bethesda. They have been working in-person since the beginning of the pandemic. When lockdown began, their jobs were turned upside down and they had to adapt almost immediately. Keeping everyone safe while continuing physical therapy was a challenge that quickly required new procedures.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33315"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Initially, when the pandemic started, we were seeing less patients per day… and we were only seeing people who really needed physical therapy, such as people who have significant amounts of pain or people who had just received a surgical procedure,” said Boris.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While the pandemic did decrease the amount of appointments being made, Boris and Andrea have continued working since the beginning of the lockdown. Working in-person during a pandemic with no long breaks has taken a toll.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Stressful. Initially, it was a lot of uncertainty. We weren’t really getting a lot of guidance from the CDC. Since rules hadn’t come down from there we were having to figure out what we needed to do a little bit real time, on our own,” said Andrea.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33316"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only does working have an impact on these essential workers, but also their families. The pandemic has put them all at risk of getting sick.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There was “some high level of uncertainty at the end of the day wondering if I was breathing COVID on my kid,” said Andrea. “One of my buddies was like ‘Hey there can we pod up?’ and I can’t pod with anyone because I’m going to work and my baby goes to daycare, so the fact I’ve been [working] the whole time has really cramped down on our social life. I felt like if we were out and about, I would be exposing people.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33317"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To prevent getting their family members sick, Boris and Andrea have created new routines for when they get home.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“I have to right away strip down my clothes, put them in the wash, go and take a shower, before I do anything else around the house,” said Boris.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“My evening routine changed a lot from like don’t pick the baby up at daycare but come home, decontaminate, keep my things in a box, shower before I touch anyone or anything,” said Andrea.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While these times have been difficult and stressful, these physical therapists have found ways to cope. Boris recommends staying active and getting outside. He explained how the natural release of endorphins can benefit your </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">mood.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33318"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“I don’t know that I have any specific coping mechanisms, but getting out and carving out some time for myself that's non negotiable has been important. Letting go of things that aren’t actually important, lowering my standards for how clean my house should be and how much stuff I should get done, that’s all giving myself a little grace there,” said Andrea.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As we all struggle through these unprecedented times, make sure to honor the essential workers in your life and realize everything they’ve sacrificed to keep us safe.&nbsp;</span></p>	33317

Students had the opportunity to visit tents run by the event's various sponsors, such as Hollister, Takis and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Most of the sponsors handed out free merchandise, although some required that students give them their email or social media usernames in exchange for the merchandise.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32154"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There was also a concert held during the event, featuring artists touring with High School Nation. Micah Blu, Sofi K, Jessame Berry, Carys and headliner Kerri Medders each performed their own singles and covers of other artists' songs. Students had the opportunity to meet the performers and take pictures with them or get autographs throughout the event. Blair's own SoundCloud rapper Ice Cooler, performed a few of his own songs too.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a poms dancer, Blair sophomore Lottie Doughty thought that it was nice that the school was doing something to promote the arts. "I like that our school's paying attention to the arts because sometimes I feel like schools in general don't put as much emphasis on the arts as I'd like," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Students who chose not to attend because they didn't want to be videotaped by the organization or for other reasons were permitted to stay in the building for quiet studying.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The assembly was controversial due to mixed feelings about High School Nation after it changed the headlining artist at the last minute.

Students with letters A-D will come on Monday, May 26; those with E-K will come on Tuesday, May 27; L-Q on Wednesday, May 28 and R-Z and make ups will come on Thursday, May 29.&nbsp;Caps and gowns will be distributed from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. all four days.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students are also encouraged to bring any materials belonging to Blair, such as English books, textbooks and anything else that is the school's property. These items should be placed in a tightly secured bag with the student's ID, first name and last name written on it or attached with a piece of paper. The bag will be taken while students are getting their caps and gowns. Athletic equipment and musical instruments will be collected on Tuesday, May 26 from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. on the side of the building facing Colesville Road. Seniors do not have to give Chromebooks back until after the MCPS virtual graduation, on June 7, and there will be another plan to collect the computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Seniors in vehicles should enter through either of the University Boulevard entrances and bring a piece of paper with their student ID, first name and last name to show the volunteers distributing caps and gowns. As students approach the bus lane, security will divide the cars into three separate lanes. Parent and teacher volunteers will set up tables along these three lanes to collect anything students drop off and hand out caps, gowns, tassels and anything else seniors would have gotten for graduation in a closed bag. Diplomas will not be handed out during this exchange and instead will be mailed to seniors after the virtual graduation ceremony.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32835"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students who use other modes of transportation should go to the Student Activity Center (SAC) entrance, following proper social distancing guidelines and wearing a mask or some sort of fabric to cover up noses and mouths. Seniors should still put any items belonging to the school inside a bag labeled with student IDs and first and last names. There will be tape on the ground showing students where to stand so that proper social distancing can be maintained. Teacher and parent volunteers will direct students on how to drop off school materials and get the bag with the cap and gown.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Staff are trying to make this process as speedy and as safe as possible. "Through the different windows of time with the different groups, making sure that we have separate lanes, making sure that we have individuals directing traffic, moving students through grabbing bags, pulling bags out quickly. I think those are all the best ways that we're trying to make sure that it's as efficient as possible," resource counselor Makeyda Soriano says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair staff wish for seniors to get their caps and gowns and enjoy their graduation as best as possible during this time. "I just hope that all the seniors take lots of pictures once they get their caps and gowns and share them out because we still want to celebrate with all the seniors," Soriano said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32834
32779	Middle school teachers "strongly suggest" that students continue their work during the COVID-19 break	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On March 18, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) released a </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/publicinfo/community/school-year-2019-2020/coronavirus-update-20200318.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">community letter</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to inform students and their families about updates on school-related activities and programs affected by COVID-19. The letter included a section for Continuity of Learning, stating that the two-week closure "is being treated as an emergency closure (similar to inclement weather days). This means that teachers are not working and will not be providing new instruction or giving new assignments to students."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32778"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition, the county developed optional learning activities and materials which were posted on myMCPS classroom as review during the break. Printed packets are also available for students who struggle to access the online classroom from home.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sixth grader Norah Braun from A. Mario Loiederman Middle School stated that the majority of her teachers were following the county's guidelines, strongly suggesting her to complete the recommended assignments on myMCPS. "They're optional, but I think I have to do them because my parents are probably going to make me. They're not graded," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sixth grader Anne Wilson from Eastern Middle School said that Braun is "lucky" that most of her teachers are following MCPS's guidelines—instead, her teachers have either been searching for loopholes or completely ignoring the guidelines. "Our teachers are giving us new material, new assignments mainly.

31805	Blair's business club prepares for their national competition in Orlando	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"The three R's of organization: Responsibility, Roles, and Rinformation," junior Peter Zhang starts his presentation on organizational structure with a bit of his classic DECA humor.</span><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"> </span><a href="https://www.deca.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">DECA</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is&nbsp;a world-wide organization that prepares emerging leaders and entrepreneurs for careers in marketing, and finance. Zhang, along with 11 other club members, is preparing for the pinnacle of the DECA season: a four day national conference in Orlando, Florida. But making it to the conference wasn't as simple as signing up and going. Blair's business club has been around for only one year, only a single season for the school's squad to have one of the most successful delegations in the state of Maryland.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the outside, the DECA club doesn't seem to have anything special. Every other Wednesday they huddle up in portable six for presentations on various business topics such as economics and marketing. However, a lot of effort went into the club that is not seen by the average observer. It's an operation that started back over the summer of 2017, when several friends, including junior vice president Alyssa Ma, had the idea to start a DECA delegation at Blair. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">"My friends and I got the idea during the summer after my freshman year to start a DECA club here at Blair," Ma says. "At the beginning, it was hard to find a sponsor who was willing to put time and energy because actually this is a horribly complicated club." Mr. Lynch, the current sponsor, was finally found after months of searching for a proper adviser. From there, the club took off, gaining several new members in the first couple of months. Currently, DECA has about 20 members, 14 of which qualified for the national competition. The competitions involve several simulations that test the members on their business knowledge. Throughout the year, the club studies using various practice tests provided by the national DECA organization.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31804"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The club decided to take it slow for the first competitions, not expecting to make a big splash in their opening year. "Our goal at the regional level was to establish ourselves as a new chapter of DECA, but then for states it was mainly just to gain experience," Ma says. When the results came back, Ma was stunned, yet glad that their hard work paid off. "This club is hard to run in general. I'm just proud of how far we've asserted ourselves into this prestigious organization."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">DECA brings together a diverse group of students, made up of students of all different walks of life. According to sophomore vice-president Joy Xu, "We're planning on reaching out to businesses and helping our communities through public service projects and community service."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Business is a dying course for high schools across the country, but DECA is one of the ways where teenagers can learn about beneficial finance skills that will help them later on in life. The club teaches students about the values of entrepreneurship and financial literacy through the lens of bigger companies such as Google and Apple."This stuff is really interesting and I really love doing the competitions where I get to use some creativity along with problem solving," Xu says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As they begin their final preparations for their April trip to Orlando, the club is shining brighter than ever. The members joke around, making the room warm with laughter during a break from Zhang's presentation. As soon as he begins, they fall silent, fully engaged in the topic of the day. A perfect mixture of fun and work.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">DECA's fantastic inaugural season will be capped off in Orlando, but Ma is still looking for new members. "If you're really passionate about business or you want to learn more about it, this club offers a great way to experience it and also wonderful possibilities for high school and for your future," Ma explains as the meeting comes to a close.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The three D's of DECA are simple: Determination, Diligence and Denthusiasm.</span></p>	31804
33589	Maryland legislature overwhelmingly voted to cast out the outdated and offensive poem.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On May 18, 2021, Governor Larry Hogan repealed “Maryland, My Maryland” as the official state song of Maryland. His decision came after a unanimous vote of 45:0 by the Maryland Senate and a majority House vote of 94:38 to remove the controversial state song, first put in place in 1939. Nationwide protests for racial justice after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 gave crucial impetus to the long-lasting effort by lawmakers to address the song's Confederate legacy.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The </span><a href="https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/symbols/lyricsco.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">lyrics</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> were written by James Ryder Randall in 1861 after </span><a href="https://worldhistoryproject.org/1861/4/19/the-baltimore-riot-of-1861" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">the Baltimore Riot</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> - a clash between Union troops marching to Washington and Confederate sympathizers.

32810	White Oak and other testing sites to test 100 patients a day	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Tuesday, April 7, Montgomery County opened its first COVID-19 testing site at White Oak’s Maryland Vehicle Administration’s (MVA) emissions testing site.

As of April 18, there are eight testing sites across the state, with patients having to receive a referral by a physician, make an appointment through the state’s online system and confirm an online ID number with a photo ID on-site, according to </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/coronavirus/drive-thru-testing-site-opens-in-white-oak/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Bethesda Magazine</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/coronavirus/drive-thru-testing-site-opens-in-white-oak/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">County Health Officer Dr. Travis Gayles</a><span style="color: rgb(32, 31, 30);"> said that the White Oak testing site aim to test roughly 100 patients a day on the two days it is open during the week. “It’s impossible to say what the county’s daily testing capacity is or how many kits are available, because there is sometimes a shortage of materials needed to gather specimens from patients,” Gayles said.</span></p><p><a href="https://www2.montgomerycountymd.gov/mcgportalapps/Press_Detail.aspx?Item_ID=25137" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">County Executive Marc Elrich </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">stated that the first Montgomery County testing site in White Oak is an initiative to fight the broad lack of adequate testing capability due to lack of resources. “</span><span style="color: rgb(32, 31, 30);">While our test supply continues to be very limited, it is important to have this process up and running. We are obviously in competition with everywhere else in the country … in terms of the equipment that’s available,” Elrich said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32, 31, 30);">When actually at the drive-thru testing site, each patient remains in their car. County and state medical employees will verify the patient’s identity and collect a patient sample with a nasal swab. The process takes roughly 10 minutes, according to </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/20/drive-thru-coronavirus-testing-step-step-look-what-expect/2873324001/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">USAToday</a><span style="color: rgb(32, 31, 30);">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32, 31, 30);">The collected sample is then placed into a sterile container and sent to a state medical lab to be tested. In the labs, a chemical is used to convert cells on the sample into a liquid.

Patients will receive their results in five to seven days.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(32, 31, 30);">The drive-thru testing sites are only a small part of the initiative the state and nation is taking to slow the spread of the COVID-19. </span><a href="https://www.holycrosshealth.org/health-and-wellness/coronavirus" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Hospitals</a><span style="color: rgb(32, 31, 30);"> in Silver Spring and Germantown will test patients in emergency rooms, but patients must contact their primary-service provider and call the hospital beforehand.

32391	Disney added disclaimers to culturally insensitive films on their new streaming app	<p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Disney unrolled their </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/is-disney-really-that-magical-32333/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">new streaming service</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"> Disney+ on Nov. 12 and is already experiencing criticism . The company announced that it is including disclaimers before movies on the app that feature “outdated cultural depictions.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The 1941 animated film “Dumbo,” which features a character named Jim Crow who leans heavily into racial stereotypes, is prefaced by a disclaimer. Some other movies, including “Peter Pan,” “Lady and the Tramp” and “The Jungle Book,” also include a disclaimer that reads, “This program is presented as originally created. It may contain outdated cultural depictions.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32390"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The disclaimer was met with both praise and criticism. Disney is aiming to start a conversation between children and their parents about the offensive content of some movies and many are applauding them for their efforts. Disney is also receiving praise for recognizing and publicizing their own culturally insensitive films while still making them available to the public. “I think the fact that they are putting the disclaimer and still allowing people to watch movies from their childhood allows for the best of both worlds and is not that big of an issue,” junior Aline Charkoudian-Rogers said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Although Disney has been commended regarding the addition of the disclaimers, many&nbsp;criticized Disney for not creating an appropriate solution to the problem. Some have said that the short disclaimer is dismissive and does not adequately address the issue of racism in their movies. Psyche Williams-Forson, chairwoman of American studies at the University of Maryland at College Park </span><a href="https://apnews.com/b03d3e6c25f04b47837fc1f197e43379" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">told AP News</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"> that the company “needs to follow through in making a more robust statement that this was wrong, and these depictions were wrong.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">There has also been controversy about the choices that Disney made concerning which films should come with a disclaimer. People have pointed out movies such as </span><em style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Pocahontas </em><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">and </span><em style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Aladdin</em><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">, which both include racist stereotypes, did not include a disclaimer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This is not the first time a media company has tried to correct their past by implementing disclaimers. In 2014, Amazon Prime, another streaming service, implemented a disclaimer before the Warner Bros. animated series “Tom and Jerry.” However, many have argued that the “Tom and Jerry” disclaimer was much more direct and effective than Disney’s. The disclaimer argued that it would be wrong to ignore the existence of cartoons such as these while emphasizing&nbsp;that "Tom and Jerry shorts may depict some ethnic and racial prejudices that were once commonplace in American society. Such depictions were wrong then and are wrong today."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Disney’s disclaimer hardly heals the wounds that many decades of insensitivity in Hollywood have caused. The common cases of cultural insensitivity and lack of representation won’t be solved easily, but the company hopes that this disclaimer will be the first step.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32390
33155	The Maryland General Assembly must override Hogan's veto on the Blueprint for Maryland's Future	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Joe Francaviglia struggled for years with getting mental health resources for his students. “I taught 33 eighth graders my second period, and the class had at least eight kids with serious mental health needs,” Francaviglia, a former teacher in Baltimore City Public Schools and current Executive Director of Strong Schools Maryland, said. “We had one school psychologist who was there part-time. My class alone would have filled her caseload.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even at Blair, students frequently have to wait in long lines to speak to their guidance counselors. This is not an adequate situation for students or teachers. We deserve better. We demand the enactment of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, a monumental education reform bill, passed in March by the Maryland State Senate and House of Delegates, that addresses education-related issues, including the allocation of mental health resources.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blueprint has five main components: retaining high quality and diverse teachers, investing in early childhood education, ensuring all students are college and career ready, giving students the resources they need to be successful, and establishing a board to oversee the implementation of the bill. Unfortunately, Governor Larry Hogan vetoed the Blueprint in May, citing economic fallout from the COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33154"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In reality, the pandemic has only further emphasized the need for the Maryland General Assembly to push legislation that will help alleviate the inequities exacerbated by COVID-19. Now, more than ever, it is critical that the General Assembly overrides Hogan’s veto to ensure that every Maryland student gets the quality education we deserve—and the resources we need in both the short and long-term.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During a normal year, the pressures of school work cause plenty of anxiety for students, but this stress is minuscule compared to the effects of COVID-19 and social isolation. According to EAB, an education consulting group headquartered in Washington, D.C.,75 percent of children receiving mental health care accessed that support in school. It is inevitable that while students learn virtually, some of them are not receiving the help that they need. While school counseling departments are doing their best to adapt to these challenging times, we must ensure that they have the staff and materials to provide even better support when we emerge from the pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If passed, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future would provide funding for more social workers, counselors, and psychologists, as well as place an emphasis on helping students with trauma. That is especially key now, as the pandemic has only increased trauma in the community, with some students losing loved ones to COVID-19 and others facing detrimental economic loss. Without the mental health resources they need, many students struggle to focus on their schoolwork and have a difficult time succeeding academically and socially. Students must have adults who are looking out for their psychological and educational well-being.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Besides supporting the mental health of students, Julie Palakovich Carr, who represents District 17 (Rockville and Gaithersburg) in the Maryland House of Delegates, believes that the bill will also bolster the education system. “It really is a landmark bill that is meant to dramatically improve the quality of public school education across the state of Maryland,” she explained. Some ways the Blueprint would do this are by making pre-kindergarten available to all students and improving the working conditions of teachers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the best ways to guarantee measures like these ones and to accomplish the passing of the Blueprint is by working with community groups. Francaviglia’s Strong Schools Maryland, for example, is an organization that aims to create the best schools for Maryland students by lobbying for the Blueprint’s passage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On a more local level, students can get involved by joining Montgomery County Students Towards Equitable Public Schools (STEPS), a student advocacy group that is working to ensure the Blueprint passes. “We're going to sit down with elected officials in Montgomery County and just make sure that we can secure the yes vote,” Avery Smedley, a senior at Albert Einstein High School and the lead organizer of STEPS, said. Students can and should also call their state representatives to encourage them to override the veto.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“This is not just about the next 20 weeks for schools; this is about the next 20 years,” Francaviglia explained. “What kind of schools do we want our students to attend when we emerge from this pandemic?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The answer is clear. We need schools with adequate mental health resources. We need pre-kindergarten for all students. We need to give all students the resources they need to be successful. We need the General Assembly to override Governor Hogan’s veto to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future.</span></p>	33154
33464	This mess of a film has few reasons for people to actually see it, except maybe to laugh at it.	<p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This review contains spoilers for the first few minutes of the movie, as well as slight spoilers for the rest of it.</em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cruella</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Disney’s latest foray into live-action territory, Disney attempts to weave a complex but entertaining narrative, providing an edgy but sympathetic look at one of their most iconic villains. Unfortunately, they instead made a movie with incredibly jarring tonal dissonance and a plot so weak and frankly ridiculous that even the somewhat creative costume design and couple of decent performances can’t save it.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The plot of “Cruella” is a strange and tangled mess. A plot point in the first few minutes is that Cruella (Emma Stone) is the name of Estella’s (the actual name of the character) “dark side” that she must not let out. Not only is this an incredibly weak premise, but it gives the film an excuse to forgo actual character development in favor of a quick personality change.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33463"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Near the beginning, Cruella (despite her name technically being Estella, she will be referred to as Cruella in this review for recognition’s sake) is shown to be a troublesome child whose mother (Emily Beecham) supports her in her dream to be a fashion designer. When Cruella and her mother go to a party, so her mother can ask the Baroness (Emma Thompson) for money, a series of incredibly contrived events culminate with her mother being attacked by trained Dalmatians and falling off of a cliff. Really. And that’s just the first ten minutes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The rest of the plot varies between trying to paint Cruella as a tragic hero who the audience should sympathize with, and the villain that pretty much everyone recognizes her as. This does not work. Strangely, Cruella is even less likable in this movie than the one where she literally wants to skin puppies for a fur coat. This is because when a character is a clear villain, with all the evil schemes to match, it’s easier for audiences to appreciate the character without necessarily siding with her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Cruella” takes the classic villain and removes all of the overtly evil characterization from her, trying to show her as more morally grey (she does not skin a single puppy in this movie). But the decision was made to leave in Cruella’s personality, and even amplify it somewhat, making her just seem really mean. It is very difficult to attach to a character who is more of a bully without even having any fun villainous moments.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout the movie, the plot, acting, characters, and general setting clash with each other, which can be highly distracting for the viewer. The director, Craig Gillespie, tries to make several different types of movies all at the same time, and it does not come together well. The setting is the 70s fashion scene, which does make for some interesting visuals and costuming. However, much of the plot seems cartoonish, like the aforementioned murder via dalmatians, making the serious hard to accept. The more realistic tone of the movie means that the cartoonish moments seem wildly out of place, and the length of the film (2 hours and 14 minutes) means that these clashes happen frequently. Combine this with the performances of Emma Thompson, who is quite good while over the top, and Emma Stone, who can be good when she isn’t doing her best “Joker” impression, and the resulting chaos nearly causes whiplash.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Cruella” also introduces the character of Artie (John McCrea), a fashion designer working with Cruella on her schemes, and widely touted in the days leading up to the movie’s release as Disney’s “first openly gay major character.” Observant readers will notice that this is not the first time Disney has gotten press for supposedly including their “first openly gay character,” as many characters who got this treatment (such as LeFou in the live action Beauty and the Beast) failed to actually be openly gay. Artie is no exception. Calling a character “openly gay” tends to imply that this character will then go on, in words or action, to be, well, open. With Artie, it’s purely subtext. He certainly is flamboyant, expressing a dislike for what “normal” people might think of his outrageous fashion, but never says or does anything explicitly stating that he’s not straight.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In an </span><a href="https://attitude.co.uk/article/disneys-cruella-star-john-mccrea-on-role-of-artie-for-me-its-official-hes-queer-1/25009/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">interview with the Attitude</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, McCrea (who is a gay man himself) says Artie’s sexuality “depends on who you’re asking,” but that for him “ he’s queer.” Being official “for him” isn’t exactly the same as it being official for everyone else, as there is a history of actors saying their characters are queer despite nothing in the actual movie serving as a testament to this (</span><a href="https://www.pride.com/geek/2021/3/05/kelly-marie-tran-thinks-her-raya-last-dragon-character-gay" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">see Raya</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in “Raya and the Last Dragon,” for example). In fact, the whole press around Artie being the “first openly gay disney character” seems to be entirely invented by journalists looking for an attention-grabbing headline. After the first interview, many other publications picked up the idea that Artie was openly gay and ran with it, choosing to critique the fact that it had taken this long.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some might argue that there isn’t any need to say anything explicitly, that the energy and general style of the character do enough to state that he is queer. However this is just queercoding, which is the subtextual coding of a character as queer, by using imagery or stereotypes. This is especially problematic due to the fact that Artie is an embodiment of many queer stereotypes. And queercoding characters (especially villains)? That’s something Disney has been intimately familiar with for decades. So, is this good representation? No. It is taking the coward’s way out. In 2021, when countless other movies, shows, and other forms of media manage to give queer people at least some explicit representation, it seems pathetic that one of the largest media conglomerates in the world can’t. Overall, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cruella</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is a strange film, with many online confused about why it even needed to exist.

32489	The academic year is set to begin before Labor Day and end after June 15	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Wednesday, Dec. 4, the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) Board of Education (BoE) announced the calendar for the 2020-2021 school year. The new calendar features some key differences from past years, most notably changes to the start and end dates, the length of spring break and professional days.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The school year will begin in August and end on June 16 for the first time since Governor Larry Hogan enacted his 2016 order that mandated Maryland public schools to begin after Labor Day and end by June 15. Hogan implemented the order to increase tourism in Ocean City during the summer, which would theoretically boost Maryland's economy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, many officials from MCPS and other school districts were upset by the governor's order because it forced the school district to shorten spring break and reduce the number of professional days for teachers. The mandate was overturned by the Maryland General Assembly earlier this year, returning the right to set school calendars to school districts.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Leslie Blaha, Blair's AP coordinator, saw many benefits for AP students from moving the start date up. "It's great, because it basically gives [AP students] another week of school before [they] have to take the exams," she said. She felt that Gov. Hogan's law didn't take into consideration everything that teachers have to do and greatly limited the ways in which MCPS could manage its calendar.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The calendar for next year also contains professional days that coincide with unrepresented cultural holidays such as Eid al Fitr and the Lunar New Year. MCPS is prohibited from closing school because of religious holidays. "The Board must have a secular justification for closing schools," MCPS explained in a </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/calendar/proposed-calendar-2020-21.aspx" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">press release</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. "Under the First Amendment, the school system cannot be closed in order to advance religion."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, it does reserve the right to overlap such holidays with professional days. One of the factors that goes into determining closure dates and professional days is attendance, so they are often scheduled for days when many students and teachers aren't at school. "System closures and Professional Development days are implemented to further a wide range of educational and operational objectives, including to… maximize student and staff attendance," MCPS said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There was some </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/county-debate-on-school-closure-for-eid-continues-32382/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">controversy</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> surrounding this decision because many Muslim parents were protesting the MCPS BoE to close school on Eid since many students already miss school because of it. Yet, there were also many parents in opposition to this proposal because they felt that there are too few Muslim students and teachers in the county to warrant closure essentially interrupting testing schedules.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blaha was thrilled to be receiving more professional days, though she still thinks that teachers need more. "Anybody who's an actual teachers understands how important it is to have professional days," she said. Professional days give teachers the time they need to close out the quarter and plan new lessons. Blaha thought it was fine that they coincided with religious and cultural holidays.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The BoE also decided that schools will remain open on Inauguration Day, despite the fact that schools have been closed for the past two Inauguration Days. Additionally, the MCPS BoE itself had a </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/policy/pdf/ida.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">policy</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that required for schools to be closed on Inauguration Day until it was amended on Nov. 12, 2019. Currently, Inauguration Day is only a federal holiday in the District of Columbia, a few counties in Va. and a couple of counties in Md., including Montgomery County. Many MCPS parents still have to go in to work so keeping schools open prevents parents from needing to find someone to watch their young children during the day.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32488"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The majority of the 2020-2021 calendar resembles that of the 2019-2020 school year. The earlier start date and additional professional days will benefit both teachers and students, despite what parents may think. Without ample time, teachers are unable to effectively do their jobs. "It just makes our lives so much harder, which makes [students'] experience worse," Blaha said. "And I think that's what people who aren't teachers don't understand."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32488
33587	MCPS staff and winter and spring student athletes must submit verification of full vaccination in the upcoming weeks	<p><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/publicinfo/community/school-year-2021-2022/BOEReview-20210909.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">On Sept. 9, the Montgomery County Board of Education passed a COVID-19 vaccine mandate </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">for all Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) staff. According to the mandate, all staff must show verification of receiving the first COVID-19 shot by Sept. 30. By Oct. 29, all staff must show verification of full vaccination.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/departments/athletics/covid/Vaccination%20Requirement%20FAQs.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">MCPS currently follows the CDC's definition for "fully vaccinated,"</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> which is defined as two weeks after the second dose of a two-dose vaccine, or two weeks after a dose of a single-dose vaccine.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Staff members may be exempted from the vaccine requirement due to medical reasons, and employees who are not yet fully vaccinated are still required to complete weekly COVID-19 tests.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Board of Education also passed a vaccination requirement for all winter and spring student athletes. Students who wish to register, try out, and participate in winter and spring sports must submit proof of full vaccination by Nov. 15.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Darryl Cooper, the security team leader at Blair, was already vaccinated before the mandate was passed. He views the vaccine mandate as an essential step in keeping Blair's&nbsp;staff safe. "With the amount of people we're going to contact working here— and of course, it's going to transfer to our personal lives— we should definitely be vaccinated," Cooper said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For Cooper, the higher the number of people vaccinated, the better. "The more the merrier, as far as vaccination goes," Cooper said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jay Baucom, a building services worker at Blair, shared Cooper's view of the mandate. "I think it's a good idea that they came up with the [vaccine], because it helps everybody… people won't die and people won't be going to the hospital," Baucom explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rebecca Huges, a social studies teacher at Blair, expressed a different perspective about the vaccine mandate. For Hughes, there is a concern about the vaccine in general. "I would not have gotten vaccinated if it wasn't required… I believe in science, but I'm a little apprehensive about big pharmaceuticals," Hughes explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hughes also did not believe that there should be a vaccine requirement for winter and spring sport athletes. "I don't think that it's fair to ask students to make a decision [between] something that is required of them to do, and something that they are passionate about and love, simply for a vaccine that we don't know the long term effects of. I think it puts kids in an awkward situation," Hughes explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jacqueline Armstead-Thomas, an art teacher at Blair who also coaches spring volleyball, did not believe that the mandate would have a significant effect on student participation in school sports. "This year is a bit of a renaissance. I feel like there's a lot of school spirit, there's a lot of students who want to get involved, and I definitely feel like students will come out for sports because they want to be involved in something, and not necessarily because they feel safer," Armstead-Thomas explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, Armstead-Thomas still viewed both vaccine mandates as positive things that will keep students and staff safe throughout the year. "Whatever we can do to stay in school and to take care of ourselves as staff and as a school, and to take care of our students, I think is just positive. [I] am willing to do whatever it takes to keep me and my students, and to stay in school all year," Armstead-Thomas said.</span></p>	33586

32604	The new club dissolved after only a few weeks but is planning to spring back in the next few months	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With each new school year, there are a plethora of new clubs for students to choose from. This year, a group of Blair students created the Hug a Tree club. With the goal of helping the local community with environmental issues, the club had a promising start, before losing traction and eventually shutting down.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The club initially made plans to work on projects in the local community helping the environment. Senior Ruby Willis spearheaded the creation of the club, hoping to facilitate frequent events to clean the local area. "I wanted to just create more cleanups, basically river cleanups, beach cleanups, that type of thing,"</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Club sponsor James Demma decided to sponsor the club based on the club's goal to help outside of the Blair community despite not knowing Willis closely. "I don't know [Willis] very well, but I agreed to sponsor this club because I liked what she said the club was going to do, which was to do environmental projects outside of Blair, " Demma said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Willis hoped her club would gain more interest based on its unique name. "People hear the name and they're like 'What's that?' and then you get to explain it's all about loving the environment. It's just a funny name," Willis explained.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There was enthusiasm for the club in its first few weeks, as club members planned a cleanup on Sligo Creek and looked forward to organizing other events. However, that excitement quickly faded. "The first couple meetings were packed with people, but then I think the momentum went down," Demma said. Most club members did not go to meetings after having trouble balancing the club with other responsibilities. "People stopped coming to the meetings because my whole club was basically seniors and it was kind of at a difficult part of the year for people to be consistent coming meetings," Willis explained. After students stopped going to meetings, Willis ultimately shut down the club,&nbsp;not wanting to run it alone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are still posters advertising the club around the school, giving an outdated club meeting time and a Remind code not in use. However, Willis intends to bring the club back this spring, aiming to keep it running for a longer period of time. She plans to recruit new members when the club starts again. "I think the Hug a Tree club could be really good and I just need to promote it more and get more people involved," Willis said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32603"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Willis is optimistic about the future of the Hug a Tree club and looks forward to accomplishing club members' goals. "Everybody in the club had really good ideas and it is just a matter of following through with them," Willis said. "I hope that we can have some successful cleanup projects as well as raise awareness about what individuals can do to reduce their carbon footprint and bring awareness to the global environmental crisis."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32603
32658	The Blazers (24-2) defeated Wheaton (5-5) 70-3 and Einstein (6-3) 71-3	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair varsity wrestling team (24-2) took the win on Thursday evening against both the Wheaton Knights (5-5) and the Einstein Titans (6-3) at their last home meet of the season. The Blazers' tough conditioning from early in the season paid off during the matches against both teams, as the majority of the matches ended with quick pins and takedowns.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32657"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After Einstein beat Wheaton during the first segment of the tri-meet, Blair wrestlers and their families gathered on the mats for senior night. The athletes received flowers, memorable posters decorated by the team managers and wrestling sweatshirts to commemorate their years of hard work on the team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair's senior night celebrated wrestlers Sideeg Abdulla, Jawara Abdullahi, Shalom Ayivi Koutodjo, team captain Elias Chen, Loann Daeninckx, Johnny Flack, Nimesh Fonseka, Jason Kaplan, Keawe Johnson, team captain Mervin Mancia, Aidan Rogers and Kemith Sturdavent, as well as managers Imran Kanyunyi, Jessenia Miranda and Kelly Leak.&nbsp;Sturdavent was thrilled for the anticipated celebration. "I was really hyped for it," he said. "I've been waiting for this since the season started."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32656"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair's matches against Wheaton passed with a breeze. Mancia and sophomore Holden DuBois earned six points each for Blair on forfeits from Wheaton. Chen, Sturdavent, Abdulla, junior and team captain Brian McCaw, Rogers, freshman Nelson Manzoeta, Kaplan and Ayivi won their matches by pinning their opponents and earned six points each as well.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite winning his match in the 120-pound weight class and bringing the score to 30-0, Abdulla received a one-point penalty for stalling as his shoelaces were untied, but he noted that his loose shoelaces have been a running gag for the team all season. It wasn't on purpose this time, but he still found it funny. "I was just too into the match and I ran in without thinking about it," he said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sophomore Nikolai Tochilin, Fonseka and sophomore Junior Kim won their respective matches on a regular decision, where they earned more individual points in their matches and hence scored three team points for Blair. Fonseka's match in the 138-pound weight class went into overtime, and the crowd's cheers soared as he got the first takedown and broke the tie. Fonseka wasn't surprised, as he expected to win. "The past two times I've gone into overtime I've lost, so I couldn't let it happen again," he said. "It's bittersweet because I know I'm better than that guy and I shouldn't have gone into overtime in the first place."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair finished their matches against Wheaton with a final score of 70-3. In the Blazers' matches against Einstein, they took the majority of pins and finished with a similar score of 71-3. The two landslide wins marked the end of an undefeated series of home meets, and fuels them for the post-regular season meets to come in February.</span></p>	32656
33072	The Red Cross needs more lifesaving supplies due to a national blood shortage	<p>The United States is experiencing a blood shortage due to mass cancellations of blood drives amidst concerns over large gatherings of people during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the FDA, every two seconds a patient needs a blood transfusion, and the Red Cross is expressing a need for lifesaving blood supplies.&nbsp;</p><p>“At the beginning of the pandemic, thousands of blood drives were canceled around the country which led to the call to action for blood donors and blood drive hosts,” Regina Boothe Bratton, Red Cross External Communications Manager, said. “Many blood drives are canceled because of the uncertainty over COVID-19. Some are canceled for other reasons, perhaps there’s an issue with space."</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33071"></div><p>The Red Cross, which collects about 40 percent of the country’s blood, reported on March 17 that nearly 2,700 blood drives had been canceled across the country, resulting in 86,000 fewer blood donations. Most of the canceled drives were supposed to be held at workplaces, college campuses, and schools—many of which shut down in mid-March, preventing the drives from occurring.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, the shortage has eased in recent weeks due to a flood of volunteers. “It was because of the generosity of everyday heroes—blood donors who partnered with us—that enabled us to overcome the severe shortage from weeks ago,” Boothe Bratton said.&nbsp;</p><p>There were so many volunteers, in fact, that appointment spots became hard to come by. Campbell Walsh, a Blair alum, and her mother Patrice Walsh tried to donate blood in mid-March, but could not schedule an appointment because there were no available spots.</p><p>“[Campbell] went online and found out that we could be a walk-in because all the appointments were booked,” Patrice said. After about four hours, the volunteer in charge of the drive was able to fit in Campbell but told Patrice he did not think he could get her in that day. “They advertised they do accept walk-ins, but they didn't realize that they would be overwhelmed. Plus with the social distancing, no one can wait,” Patrice added.&nbsp;</p><p>To keep donors and staff safe, The Red Cross has implemented new protocols for collecting blood. “[The volunteer running the drive] would tell people to wait in their car, and he would actually direct people where to sit,” Campbell said. “It was a very clean and socially distanced process… There were no more than five people in the lobby at a time, and people were at least six feet apart at all times.”</p><p>When junior Abby Kusmin went to give blood with her mother, she also noticed the safety measures in place. “We had masks on because they sent us a reminder to bring masks,” Kusmin said. “They took our temperature at the door, and then they gave us hand sanitizer.”&nbsp;</p><p>One way the federal government has acted to reduce the shortage is by revising an FDA guideline that bans blood donations from men who have had sex with other men within the last 12 months. On Apr. 2, the FDA revised the guideline, created during the HIV/AIDS crisis, to a three month deferral period in an attempt to alleviate the blood shortage. Many doctors are now calling for an end to the ban altogether as they argue it is based more on stigmas than science.&nbsp;</p><p>“It seems like just that stigma is lingering and that's why this policy is still there,” Dr. Monica Hahn, who specializes in HIV Prevention and Management, said to Good Morning America. “There's really no scientific reason anymore, in my opinion, to have this ban at all since our testing capacity has been truly revolutionized.”</p>	33071

The return of in-school learning seemed to promise a sense of normalcy that students and staff previously lacked.

Kids have been bored, they’ve been home, and now they’re back out and have some freedom, kids are indulging,” Cooper says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though, he adds, he doesn’t notice much of the vandalism happening at Blair, but rather at middle schools, according to the county. “I’m just glad the kids here at Blair are more mature [than] to indulge in such a devious thing...I think that a lot of kids are aware that the school is newly painted over the summer...and I think a lot of them aren’t just thinking about destroying the school,” Cooper says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair media specialist Andrea Lamphier is also glad that (from her perspective) Blair seems to have escaped the trend’s wrath. “We have not heard about anything at Blair...but we’ve been very pleased with the way Blazers have been adapting to coming back to school,” Lamphier says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But Lamphier is also deeply saddened to hear about other schools where that isn’t the case. “It just makes me really, really sad...if teachers are working in a healthy, positive, happy environment, that’s what they’re bringing back to their own families. If it’s happening, I think it would make anyone sad,” Lamphier says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, though Lamphier and Cooper’s jobs are mostly unaffected by Devious Licks, Alain Perron, Blair’s building manager, and his staff are not so lucky. “We’ve been addressing it and repairing and replacing a lot of items that have been broken and removed...A number of paper towel holders have been broken [and] for a two-day period I replaced eight soap dispensers.” Perron says. Toilet paper dispensers typically cost around $20, while paper towel dispensers are about $60.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Perron views the trend's prominence as an act of disrespect to him and his staff. “[Vandalism] like that do[es] make us feel disrespected...I feel we don’t have enough staff to take care of [the current sanitation protocols]...And those types of [pranks] just add on to more stuff that we have to do,” Perron says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Perron adds that the trend’s rise to popularity just put more pressure on an already strained building service department, one that already has to deal with the increase of sanitation protocols due to COVID-19. “A lot of people higher up don’t realize that Blair is basically a high school and a half. We have a lot of students, so we can’t treat this school like Magruder...yet we both get allocated the same amount of cleaning supplies,” Perron says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But at the end of the day, the trend leaves Perron feeling sad more than anything else. “The students of Blair, for the most part, are proud of Blair, and they’re proud of the school. And sometimes I wonder why they show it this way,” Perron says.</span></p>	33590
31982	Celebrities walk the line when it comes to social reform	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The constant spotlight placed on celebrities gives them endless opportunities to advocate for what they believe and to have an impact on their fans. Influencers regularly promote all sorts of brands in: food, fashion, skincare, technology, etc. But conflict arises when these same celebrities start to work towards social reform.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In 2018, Kim Kardashian turned heads when she fought to get Alice Marie Johnson freed from prison. Johnson was convicted on federal drug and money laundering charges and sentenced for life. After Johnson had served 21 years, Kardashian caught wind of her case, garnered support from politicians and scheduled a meeting with the White House. Within six months of Kardashian’s support, President Trump granted clemency to Johnson, allowing her to be released immediately. (For more information about the case, click </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/13/us/kim-kardashian-alice-johnson/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">here</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">)</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31981"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since this highly-publicized case, Kardashian and lawyers Brittany Barnett and MiAngel Cody have freed 17 people from prison — people who have been serving long-term sentences for low-level crimes. Her newest case: A$AP Rocky.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rocky has been detained in a Swedish jail for the past two weeks after an altercation in Stockholm. Multiple reports claim the conditions are "inhumane" with the rapper spending 23 hours a day in solitary confinement. Kardashian reached out to President Donald Trump's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, while her husband Kanye West spoke to the president directly. Trump has since tweeted that he would be in contact with Sweden's prime minister and even offered to personally bail out Rocky.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;This news is great to hear. But what about all of the individuals who are incarcerated unjustly that do not have Kardashian's support? The media highlighting Kardashian's work in a couple cases and labelling it prison reform does not accurately reflect the inadequacies of the criminal justice system.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;In addition, Kardashian is turning her efforts into a crime documentary, which is currently set to be titled </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kim Kardashian: The Justice Project</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. It will follow Kardashian as she works to free people that she believes were wrongfully incarcerated. This brings the altruistic nature of her work into question. This could all just be a publicity stunt.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Kardashian's passion, however, is evident. She is currently studying to become a lawyer, having begun a four-year apprenticeship with a San Francisco law firm in the summer of 2018 and planning to take the bar in 2022.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Regardless, prison reform needs public attention, whether or not Kardashian takes interest in it. What definitely does not help is when a celebrity makes a lot of waves in a particular area and then leaves, allowing society and the media to feel like the issue has been resolved and no longer requires further support.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;This seems to be the case as prison reform comes in and out of the spotlight with Kardashian. Media covered the Johnson case and is now covering the Rocky case. In between, we have been faced with relative silence and little improvement on the issue.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Another celebrity pulling a major issue into the limelight is Taylor Swift. After years of keeping her political views in the dark, the singer released a petition on June 1, in celebration of pride month, urging the Senate to pass the Equality Act. The Equality Act is legislation that would create federal protections for LGBTQ Americans against discrimination on the basis of “sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity,” specifically in areas including housing, employment, access to public accommodations and more.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;With her 120 million fans, Swift has been able to accumulate nearly 483,000 signatures. Her latest single, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">You Need to Calm Down, </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">focuses on equality specifically for the LGBTQ community. Her intent seems to be to align herself with LGBTQ fans – the music video featured queer stars and included a call to action for listeners to sign her petition.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Critics claim she is using pride as a marketing strategy or a fashion statement. But that can be proved false when taking all of her actions into account. Swift has so far received support from five senators on her petition and she is not backing down. She continues to be outspoken about the issue at award ceremonies, performances, and on regular social media posts.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Additionally, the petition comes following two years of Swift’s subtle support to the LGBTQ community in the form of: donations to the Stonewall Inn and the Tennessee Equality Project, a 2017 performance with Haley Kiyoko at the Ally Coalition concert, and criticisms of Tennessee senators Marsha Blackburn and Lamar Alexander.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The question remains the same: when do celebrities go too far? In the cases of both Swift and Kardashian, their commitment to the issues that they are focused on is evident. Conflict arises nonetheless, but it is safe to say that they have not spoken out just for fame or money. The real issue surfaces when celebrities use social issues to promote themselves.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;But one thing is for sure: the media has to change their depiction of celebrities in regard to social reform. A social issue is not resolved just because a celebrity gets involved. Coverage of these issues should not start and end with the celebrity. And the public needs to understand that the problems run much deeper than what meets its eye.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31981
33095	Vegas lights are not shining	<p>Millions tuned in to watch Roger Goodell, the Commissioner of the National Football League, announce the first round picks of the first-ever virtual NFL Draft on Apr. 23. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Goodell announced each name from the comfort of his own home rather than under the bright lights of Las Vegas, where the draft was originally supposed to be held.</p><p>As usual, the broadcast showed the elated reactions of players as they heard their names called. But this year, players were at home celebrating with their families instead of walking on stage to shake Goodell’s hand or give him a big hug. On the first night of the draft, the NFL had cameras in nearly 60 prospective players’ homes, along with those of coaches and general managers calling the shots for their teams. This “really humanized the NFL draft in a way that hadn't happened previously,” Mark Maske, an NFL reporter for The Washington Post, wrote in an email to Silver Chips.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33094"></div><p>With much of the country ordered to stay home due to the pandemic, the broadcast crushed previous records for the amount of people watching. At the height of the broadcast, over 19.6 million football fans watched their favorite NFL teams select from a field of talented college athletes, with an average of about 15.6 million watching for most of the night—a 37 percent increase from last year. Days two and three also set records for the amount of viewers, with 8.2 million on day two and 4.2 million on day three, according to Maske.</p><p>Joe Burrow, Louisiana State University’s star quarterback and winner of the Heisman trophy, was taken first overall by the Cincinnati Bengals. Ohio State defensive end and Prince George’s County native Chase Young was picked second by Washington.</p><p>The draft, however, focused on more than just the college football players. The pandemic played a large part in the broadcast, in commercials with players telling everyone to “stay strong” and “stay safe.” Additionally, a video of Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the nation’s leading voices during the pandemic, aired at the beginning of the broadcast.</p><p>The NFL hosted “Draft-a-Thon” to raise money to “help provide relief to the many who are suffering as well as those on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic around the nation,” according to the NFL Relief website. Over $6.9 million have been donated by fans around the world as of publication.&nbsp;</p><p>To get people to donate, the NFL featured current and newly-drafted players, coaches, and other celebrities, including comedian Kevin Hart and record producer DJ Khaled, on live videos on the NFL website and social media accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>“The celebrity star power was a contributing factor to the amount of money raised,” Maske wrote in an email. “But I also believe that this is such a shared experience for everyone in the country that people can truly empathize with those in need. I feel like the fundraising totals would have been very significant even without that celebrity factor.”</p><p>This draft was certainly different than any other before it, but viewers still tuned in to watch every night. “The NFL had to make a difficult decision about whether to move forward and have the draft or not,” Maske added. “But once that decision was made, things turned out better for the NFL than it could have hoped.”&nbsp;</p><p>“People seemed to really like the human element of [the draft] and the little imperfections here and there. There was no major technical glitches. The TV ratings were huge. Viewers not only were given something to watch to ease their boredom. They were given some sense of things being somewhat normal amid the pandemic and the lockdowns.”</p>	33094
33097	Our reliance on food delivery services will continue after quarantine	<p>In only a matter of weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly damaged many of America’s central industries. The food industry, in particular, has been forced to climb a steep learning curve as it races to adapt to a reality in which hungry customers are not allowed to step through the front doors.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a solution for both businesses and consumers, even as most states have ordered stay-at-home orders: food delivery services such as Uber Eats, GrubHub, DoorDash, and Postmates.</p><p>Food delivery services are not the products of the quarantine induced by the pandemic. Pizza delivery and Chinese takeout have always been staples at American dinner tables. Moreover, popular platforms like Uber Eats, Postmates, and GrubHub were launched years ago.</p><p>It’s no surprise that these services have seen increases in demand for their services over the past several weeks. With the majority of America at home, the choice between cautiously trekking to the grocery store or downloading delivery services’ convenient ordering apps is an easy one.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33096"></div><p>Junior Althea De Castro, for one, began using food delivery services as a result of the pandemic. “Before the pandemic, I barely used any of the apps because of the delivery fee,” she says. “I thought that was unnecessary and I didn't want to pay that. But now that we're in the middle of a pandemic, I really don't have much of a choice.”</p><p>De Castro, the oldest of three children, has had to provide her family meals since her mother was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 and went into self-quarantine. Since her interview, De Castro’s mother has now recovered.</p><p>Services like Uber Eats and Postmates have been incredibly helpful for De Castro, as cooking isn’t exactly her area of expertise. “I'm not gonna lie, it's pretty hard because I can't really cook,” De Castro says. “But using these delivery services has really put me at ease in providing food for my siblings and I.”</p><p>Even so, constantly ordering out still has its challenges. “I guess really the only downfall for me, ordering out, is that [such services] can get quite expensive,” she says.</p><p>De Castro still has to adjust to her newfangled experience with ordering from meal delivery services, which collectively saw a 24 percent year-over-year growth through the end of March. She and many others in a similar predicament will continue to rely on this different approach to dining. “It's not like we're struggling with getting food, it's just a lot different from before,” she says.</p><p>However, others like junior Ana Eve Rubin have qualms about using such services amid a highly contagious virus. “I have never used one of those companies before because it just freaks me out to think about other people handling my food,” Rubin says. “It definitely makes me nervous because you don't know who has the virus,” she says.</p><p>While helpful to some, students like Rubin are still skeptical and reluctant to use such services. But these worries have been partially discredited. “No reported cases have been linked to the contamination of food. The main risk of transmission is from close contact with infected people,” reported the Food and Drug Administration. Most of these services are still in development and many people are confused on certain areas, such as how restaurant owners and drivers are paid through them.</p><p>For starters, services like Uber Eats hire drivers 19 and older, who can decide their own working hours and schedule. Other requirements include being able to lift 30 pounds and using a vehicle manufactured after 1999. Uber Eats drivers are paid $8 to $12 an hour and receive 100 percent of their tips.</p><p>There is contention around how fairly restaurants are paid when they partner with food delivery services. Uber Eats requires partnered restaurants to pay 30 percent of their listed prices to the company for delivery fees. However, Uber does not allow restaurants to increase their prices to cover the delivery cost.</p><p>Some restaurateurs feel short-changed by such restrictions and would rather have customers order directly. In an Instagram post, Maryland restaurant owner Ashish Alfred asked people to renounce food delivery services because of the “25-30% commission rates” that they have to pay. “Delete every delivery app on your phone,” he declared.</p><p>Alfred is not alone in his frustrations. Uber Eats, along with DoorDash, Postmates, and GrubHub, have received further backlash from consumers and were sued in a class-action lawsuit in Manhattan federal court for charging “exorbitant” delivery fees.</p><p>Business practices aside, food delivery services evidently will play a vital role in the restaurant industry as the world continues to become increasingly reliant on the internet. With the ubiquity of online shopping and food delivery, the internet will prove to be necessary for the services it provides our society. For local restaurants whose customers no longer have the option to dine-in, these meal-delivery services could be a saving grace.</p><p>Of course, there is much room for improvement for these services to benefit local restaurants more and charge lower rates, but nevertheless, delivery services provide an important platform for customers to show support for their favorite local eateries and explore new ones at the same time. “It's always nice to discover different cuisines and order from places other people have recommended to me,” De Castro says. “It feels good knowing that these small businesses are being supported,” she says.</p>	33096
32576	The Blazers (23-2) beat Northwood (0-23) 78-6	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Tuesday night's wrestling meet, the Blazers (23-2) beat the Northwood Gladiators (0-23) by a landslide with a score of 78-6, winning all but one of their matches. With a relatively small lineup of seven wrestlers, Northwood was forced to forfeit seven of the 14 matches, losing six points for each match.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Holden DuBois, junior Brian McCaw, senior Sideeg Abdulla, freshman Nelson Manzoeto, senior Shalom Ayivi, senior and team captain Elias Chen and sophomore Aaron Vernon each won six points based on forfeited matches. Senior Aidan Rogers, sophomore Nikolai Tochilin, sophomore Junior Kim, senior Nimesh Fonseka, senior Jason Kaplan and sophomore Izu Nweke each won six points by pinning their opponents, bringing the score to 78-0 leading into the final match.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32575"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the 145-pound weight class, Fonseka used the forfeit-heavy game as an opportunity to experiment on the mat. "I've been waiting until the third period to go 100 percent in my previous matches, and I wanted to test myself this time," he said. "I also tried to work in some moves that I've been practicing in the room."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kim's pin took more work than he initially expected, and he went head to head with an extremely aggressive opponent in the 138-pound weight class. "I was actually pretty surprised by his toughness, so we shouldn't underestimate another team just because they have fewer wrestlers," Kim said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Kemith Sturdavent lost the last match to Northwood and the Blazers ended the meet 78-6, but head coach Tim Grover was satisfied. "Northwood's heavyweight is very good— he's ranked very high in the state and our guy is a first year wrestler, so I'm not too upset about it," Grover said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chen noted that the Blazers have an amicable relationship with the Gladiators. "We've been wrestling with their better guys in the offseason, and tonight was a pretty friendly meet with our sister school," he said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For Blair, tonight's win was just a "check off the box" as the team prepares for bigger postseason meets according to Grover. Chen said Northwood kept the Blazers on their feet and focused for the upcoming varsity tournament this weekend. "They didn't have many guys, but they're still pretty tough," senior and team captain Elias Chen said. "We knew we were going to win on forfeits, but we wanted to win the matches, too."</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Varsity wrestling will play their next home match on Wednesday, Jan. 29 against Einstein and Wheaton at 6:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32575
33099	How toxic hustle culture has permeated this pandemic	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33098"></div><p>Now is the time to learn a language, make a YouTube channel, and start your next big coding project. Now is the time to create a garden, paint the next Mona Lisa, and write a book.&nbsp;</p><p>From the internet, newspapers, and even TikTok, we’ve been hearing these sentiments over and over again: We <em>must </em>maximize the efficiency of our quarantine time.</p><p>A rampant phenomenon even before this pandemic, toxic productivity culture threw itself into quarantine mindsets with a resounding bang.</p><p>Toxic productivity has monikers like “hustle culture” and “workaholism.” It preaches that exhaustion is a sign of success, that we should measure our self-worth by how much time we dedicate to “productive tasks.”</p><p>It shames us for feeling slow and lethargic when we have every reason to be. It criticizes inaction. It interjects with a “well, Isaac Newton developed calculus in quarantine” or with a “you know, Shakespeare wrote <em>King Lear</em> in quarantine.” And it has permeated this pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s remember that Newton escaped to his family estate during quarantine. He had the resources to stay isolated without worrying about food or shelter. And he was already working on his theories <em>before</em> quarantine.</p><p>Right now, something feels off. There’s a nagging anxiety at the back of our minds. It could be because hundreds of thousands of people are dying, or it could be because a friend or family member has contracted the coronavirus.</p><p>It’s only logical to feel scared. Every day, the numbers climb. Emotionally, it’s exhausting to keep up.&nbsp;</p><p>We shouldn’t feel ashamed if we can’t accomplish our life goals during quarantine. In fact, our goal right now shouldn’t be to achieve greatness in isolation. It should be to establish a new daily routine we can live by, to stay connected with friends and family, and to keep a clear head.&nbsp;</p><p>Even for those of us privileged enough to stay home with adequate resources, it’s important to remember that we are not obligated to churn the wheels of toxic productivity culture right now.&nbsp;</p><p>Take as much time as you need to process this situation. After all, our lives have turned upside down in the span of a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Our duty is to stay sane, stay healthy—not to do everything we can to keep working from our bedrooms.&nbsp;</p><p>After you have a handle on your situation, maybe reach out to that teacher you haven’t been able to respond to. Maybe try to re-engage with your old hobby you’ve been neglecting. Remember to eat regularly and drink water.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of trying to accomplish a dozen new achievements in quarantine, let’s focus on staying well during this turbulent time, mentally, physically, and emotionally.&nbsp;</p>	33098
32516	Blair librarians are hoping to expand outreach through a different language	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In mid-November, the Blair library built a brand-new Spanish section to give students more diverse reading options. While the section is relatively small at the moment, librarians are hoping to expand it as time goes on.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Behind the quiet study desks, the Spanish bookshelf sits right across from the non-fiction section of the Media Center. Library staff members set out an array of different types of books, from Spanish literature classics to more lighthearted pieces of work, in hopes to give Blazers a variety of books to choose from. "It's ranging from truly classic items to things like the Diary of a Wimpy Kid in Spanish, and students can't get enough of those,"&nbsp;media specialist Andrea Lamphier said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32514"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While Spanish books have been in the library in the past, they were never in one collective place that made them easily accessible. Spanish books that have been in the library for a while were put in the new Spanish section along with new books that media center staff ordered. "We had Spanish books already in different parts of the Media Center, so we just had to collect them and get some new books that we ordered," library assistant Nancy Valenzuela said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Valenzuela saw the new library section as a way to help students in Blair who have cultures rooted in Spanish and Latin origin to stay connected to the languages they grew up with.&nbsp;"I'm hoping that kids are going to read those books and improve their language in Spanish so they don't forget it," Valenzuela said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The new section will not be used only by those who are native Spanish speakers, but also those who are new to the language. "I think it's really helpful for everybody. Many kids want to learn new languages because it helps them figure out how to read and how to write," freshman Kimberly Hernandez said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair students believe that the addition can also help those who are interested in diving deeper into the different cultures that surround the language. "As a Latino myself, I would like to learn more about other cultures around the world like Latino American countries and just learn more and expand my knowledge," freshman Carlos Castro Gomez said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Library staff members are hoping Blair students take advantage of the new library section and make full use of it. "We hope the kids will notice, and if they want to come to read, they will have those Spanish books," Valenzuela said.</span></p>	32514
32633	International film has been highly undervalued in the U.S. but that might be changing	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The awards season is in full swing and movie fans are talking about the same high profile actors, big shot directors and, of course, Hollywood’s inclusivity problem. But this year, a new star has emerged onto the big screen: foreign films. Last year, Roma set a high standard for successful foreign films, with its director Alfonso Cuarón winning an Academy Award for best director. However, a year later, those standards have been smashed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The wildly successful South Korean feature film Parasite garnered six Academy Award nominations this year as well as winning the Palme d’Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Globe for best foreign language motion picture. Parasite's unmatched success is well-deserved and hopefully foreshadows a future in which Americans recognize international films as much as they recognize American movies.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32634"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Americans are often scared of movies in languages other than English. People write subtitles off as an inconvenience. But the trivial effort needed to read the subtitles of a two hour movie is well worth it. “Parasite” director Bong Joon Ho said it perfectly in his acceptance speech at the Golden Globes: “Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The value of exposure to entertainment from other countries is underappreciated. Foreign films provide the opportunity to take a glance into the lives of people from across the world. Not only can you discover a whole new world of film, but you are introduced to the ideals and beliefs of other cultures. International film can be the first step toward a more global perspective, something that Americans lack.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Generally, international news and travel are not valued as much in the U.S. as in other countries. In fact, in </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lealane/2019/05/02/percentage-of-americans-who-never-traveled-beyond-the-state-where-they-were-born-a-surprise/#1b27a3932898" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">research conducted by OnePoll</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> on 2,000 people across the country 40 percent of those surveyed had never left the county. 11 percent of the group had never even traveled outside of their home state. Furthermore, a </span><a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/survey-geography-foreign-relations-americans-students/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">2016 National Geographic study</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> showed that most young Americans could not pass a test on international affairs. Whether this is the result of disinterest or lack of information, Americans need to do a better job at looking past our borders and foreign films are a good start.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This year’s Academy Award nominees for best international feature film is a group of extraordinary movies in a diverse set of languages. This year’s nominees include films from Poland, North Macedonia, France, Spain and South Korea. While we could all be enjoying these beautiful films and learning about the cultures of other countries, the majority of Americans will be missing out because they are scared of subtitles.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Americans need to remember that not every cinematic masterpiece comes out of Hollywood. By ignoring film that comes from other countries, we are excluding ourselves from a more global society. This award season, and every season, we should take Bong Joon Ho’s advice and get over the 1-inch-tall barrier.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32634
33215	Although the movie is certainly a flashy and fun spectacle, it lacks the depth that made the first movie great	<p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Warning: this review contains spoilers for “Wonder Woman” and slight spoilers for “Wonder Woman 1984”</em></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33214"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Wonder Woman 1984” was a highly anticipated sequel, given the success of the first movie, but doesn’t quite live up to expectations. The first Wonder Woman movie, released in 2017, was a thrilling tale of heroes, wars and gods, with Gal Gadot starring as Wonder Woman (aka Diana Prince) striving to take down the forces behind World War I. “Wonder Woman 1984” feels like it has lower stakes, despite technically being about a force that could threaten all of humanity. Part of this stems from the fact that things unravel so quickly. This, coupled with slightly weak villains, leads to a fun enough action movie with a lot of heart, but that doesn’t quite measure up to the original.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Wonder Woman 1984,” released on Dec. 25, starts about 60 years after “Wonder Woman” left off. Diana has adjusted to her life as an anthropologist in the 80s, with only passing regrets for Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), her former lover. While working at the National History museum, she meets Barbara (Kristen Wiig), an archeologist with low self-esteem and an almost painfully cliche character. When the audience first meets her, she is bespectacled and clumsy, looking up to Diana. Rather predictably, her glow-up only consists of her taking off those glasses and wearing slightly nicer clothing. Kristen Wiig is a fantastic actor, but the use of lazy cliches doesn't make Barbara a unique enough character to stand on her own.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The movie’s main villain, made clear the moment the audience meets him, is Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal). Although Pascal’s slight overacting makes him a suitably dramatic and entertaining villain, and very fun to watch, the movie seems to scramble to give him a tragic backstory too late which comes off as rushed. Possibly due to the fact that there are two villains, neither is given quite enough time to fully become a unique, developed character, or enough time to make us care about their motives. This is slightly odd especially with the long runtime. However, since the movie is so long, it introduces many things that it then can’t flesh out fully.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, the movie is not all bad. Gal Gadot once again shines in the titular role, while Chris Pine returning to play Steve Trevor creates a couple very sweet scenes where the two showcase their fantastic chemistry. The special effects are also amazing for the most part, with the fight scenes ending up looking very polished and most of the CGI looking natural. These elements come together to create a film that is entertaining, but suffers from the comparison to the original that sequels often get.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Film director Patty Jenkins clearly understood that any sequel would be harshly looked at considering the success of the first, which could be part of the reason for the extended flashback at the beginning. This flashback shows Diana’s childhood on Themyscira as she takes part in a large competition, and is possibly one of the most beautiful parts of the film due to the gorgeous scenery and costuming, as well as the welcome return to a part of the first movie that was well-loved. The only downside of this flashback is the heavy-handed moral message of “don’t take shortcuts” seemingly shoved into it, which feels forced.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Overall, “Wonder Woman 1984” is a fine sequel, but doesn't really add anything new. The villains are interesting but cliche, and the special effects fun but slightly overdone. However, the movie is a decent way to spend 155 minutes.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Wonder Woman 1984” is rated PG-13 and is available for streaming on HBO Max.&nbsp;</em></p>	33214
32461	A web-based version of the Ride On Real Time app has accurate bus arrival times and replaces its flawed mobile app counterpart.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whether a student uses public transportation to commute to school, work or special events, they undoubtedly agrees with junior Lawrence Tang's frank conclusion of the Ride On Real Time app: "[it's] quite janky." Students reach such a consensus regarding the app because it blatantly fails at the very functionality it promotes. As its name implies, the main point of the Real Time app is to display the locations of Ride On buses in real time, but the app is nothing more than an inaccurate bus schedule.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Leela Mehta-Harwitz has used the mobile bus app and suffered from its inaccuracy for over a year. "Just yesterday it [the app] said the 16 [bus] was coming in 22 minutes, and then I missed it because it came thirty seconds after me opening the app… it's not that reliable, so I always show up ten minutes early if I can help it," Mehta-Harwitz says. The "Realtime" option on the app claims to track each bus's location in real time, but Mehta-Harwitz's distrust of any arrival times displayed on the app reveals only an empty promise.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Nov. 1, The Montgomery County Department of Transportation (MCDOT) replaced the outdated and inaccurate mobile app with a </span><a href="https://rideon.app/locationquery" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">web-based version</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> of Ride On Real Time, which utilizes GPS technology to track Ride On Buses and refreshes the buses' locations every few seconds to give users an accurate reading.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MCDOT acknowledges how inaccurate their mobile app is, choosing to advertise their new website with, "Finally an answer to the question, "Where's my bus?"" With the new website, students will receive the precise location of their bus, a major improvement from the mobile app estimations Junior Francesco Berret describes, "[The mobile app] is decently helpful for overall estimates, but I don't think I've ever seen it be completely accurate within a minute or two."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The website's interface is simple and a bit outdated, including only the options and visuals essential to the website's function. Regardless of the website's lack of aesthetic appeal, it is intuitive, with descriptions on what to enter into each text field and a map to help users track their buses, and upon usage, the times displayed on the site seem to align well with the actual bus departure and arrival times. "The interface is kind of annoying, but it looks like the times are accurate," Mehta-Harwitz says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The site allows users to input their initial and ending streets or intersections to find information on which routes and buses to take to their destination. Unless these users also take the public bus regularly, however, using Google Maps to plan their routes would be quicker and easier.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32460"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Google Maps displays the exact times as the Ride On website, except the former has more user-friendly features to help users navigate through bus routes. Maps lets users search up broader destination and arrival locations - such as restaurants, businesses, or stores - rather than requiring users to input in specific street names and intersections.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The website is more convenient to regular bus riders than to riders who may use public transportation sporadically. It gives users the option to focus on the activity surrounding a specific stop or area without having to input a destination, which benefits students who already know what bus they want to take. Overall, the website does its basic job well: it accurately predicts what time the bus will come - a massive improvement from the mobile app's Realtime feature.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32460
32714	Blair students participate in climate activism both in and out of school.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every Friday morning, junior Abby Kusmin dons a surgical mask as she sets up the silent strike table in the SAC. Kusmin is the founder of Blair's silent strike movement, the goal of which is to raise awareness of climate change and promote more action towards climate justice in school. "[Silent striking] is a super accessible form [of climate activism], and you can do it for however much of the day you're able to," she says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32711"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The silent strikes began on Sept. 27, 2019, the last day of the Global Week for Future. The week kicked off on Sept. 20 with a mass strike. There was another strike on Sept. 27, but many students, like Kusmin, couldn't afford to miss another day of school. "There were other climate activists here who weren't able to skip school for a second time, so we wanted to have a way to take action in school," she says. Thus the silent strike movement was born, and has continued to take place on every Friday in school since then.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">By Kusmin's estimates, there were originally 30 to 40 silent strikers each week, but now that number has dwindled due to a lack of regulars. Some students, however, take part in Friday climate action outside of school in addition to silent striking.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32712"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">﻿Junior Maddie Graham goes on strike every Friday after school from 2-6 p.m. on Capitol Hill. Typically around 20 to 30 participants show up, but the turnout has been increasing, Graham notes. Kusmin and Blair junior Eva Allred also consistently attend the weekly strikes. Blair is one of the more active schools at these protests, along with Northwood and Blake. "In MoCo (Montgomery County), Blair is definitely the biggest school for Fridays for Future," Graham says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fridays for Future is an international movement, started by 17-year-old Greta Thunberg, a young climate activist in Sweden who began skipping school every Friday to protest the lack of action taken on climate change. "We have schools all around the world who are participating in a way that is appropriate for their region," Graham says. It is much more strike-based than Sunrise Movement, another climate action group for youth, of which Graham is a leader.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sunrise Movement is mostly focusing on passing the Green New Deal, a bill proposed by House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that is designed to fight climate change and economic inequality. "We lobby, we pressure elected officials, we organize, we canvas, we get people to vote," Graham says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The next major worldwide event that they have planned is a strike on Earth Day. "The Earth Day strike is going to be the largest mass mobilization of people for climate action ever," Graham says. She and the other D.C. organizers have already begun planning for it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair students have lots of options to get involved in climate activism, whether they are willing to make a large or small commitment to it. One aspect that stays the same no matter what form their activism takes is the feeling of empowerment that comes with demanding change. "It helps to see other activists that are able to get out there," Allred says. "Seeing people in person who are fighting for the same thing as you is very empowering."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32711
33426	In Rivera we trust	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For the first time in too long, Washington had a competent coach and general manager making the draft picks without interference from owner Daniel Snyder. Washington addressed needs at linebacker, offensive line and wide receiver, but failed to find a potential quarterback of the future. I trust what head coach Ron Rivera, as well as general managers Martin Mayhew and Marty Hurney decided to do in this draft, and can’t wait to see how these players perform. Here is my analysis on each of the Washington Football Team's (WFT) selections for the 2021 NFL Draft.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33425"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 1, Pick 19:</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Ron Rivera and Co. selected </span><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jamin-davis/32004441-5642-8592-9936-07896f5591cc" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Jamin Davis</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (LB-Kentucky) to start things off. Davis, a 6’3 1/2”, 234 lb athlete plugs a longtime need for Washington. Although he only started 11 times during his 3 seasons in college, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBKy0KED5cs" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Davis’</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> size, focus and ability to intercept passes shows he is talented enough to play in the NFL. His comparisons to Darius Leonard and Kiko Alonso give fans an idea of what he’ll bring to an already talented Washington defense. Even though I initially thought Washington should have selected Christian Darrisaw (OT-Virginia Tech) with this pick, I like Jamin Davis and trust Washington’s decision, especially if he lives up to his NFL comparisons.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 2, Pick 51: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Washington filled a big offensive need by drafting </span><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sam-cosmi/3200434f-5319-6802-cc94-36bf0ee8edce" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Samuel Cosmi</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (OT-Texas). Cosmi had plenty of success and experience as a tackle during his 3 years as a Longhorn. Continuing to fill the void left by the departure of Trent Williams during the 2020 offseason was a big priority for Washington, and it is great that they addressed it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 3, Pick 74: </strong><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/benjamin-st-juste/32005354-4a61-5310-ff81-e57e99306a29" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Benjamin St.-Juste</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (CB-Minnesota), is an interesting player. After almost retiring due to injuries, St.-Juste bounced back and impressed after transferring to Minnesota from Michigan. Despite limited experience, there seems to be potential for the Canadian, and could help bolster the secondary or special teams with his size and tackling skills.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 3, Pick 82: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Selecting </span><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dyami-brown/32004252-4f40-8220-1974-8f5000372de2" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Dyami Brown</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (WR-UNC), was a steal for Ron Rivera and the WFT. Brown is incredibly fast and averaged for 20+ yards over his last 100 catches. The Tar Heel product will fit nicely alongside Terry McLaurin and Curtis Samuel, posing a big threat to opposing defenses. This is a great pick, and Brown has potential to be very good in the NFL.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 4, Pick 124: </strong><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/john-bates/32004241-5410-9191-4912-a52aed715316" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">John Bates</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (TE-Boise State) seems like a fringe player that may not even make the roster. He has only two career touchdowns over 47 catches in 46 games, but isn’t a bad blocker. Washington should’ve addressed this position earlier in the draft or done something else with this pick, especially because of the lack of tight end prospects.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 5, Pick 163: </strong><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darrick-forrest/3200464f-5248-5545-c56f-5beae4773c4c" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Darrick Forrest</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (S-Cincinnati) could definitely contribute to the Washington defense, addressing a need at full safety. Forrest seems to be a versatile player that succeeded in college, earning All-American Athletic Conference accolades.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 6, Pick 225: </strong><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/camaron-cheeseman/32004348-4518-9637-63dc-9c9dc3dbe3b2" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Camaron Cheeseman</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (LS-Michigan) has more upside than downside. Every few drafts this position needs to be addressed, and Cheeseman could be solid in the nation’s capital.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 7, Pick 240: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Why not add more depth at an already solid spot on the defensive side of the ball? </span><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-bradley-king/32004252-4125-1763-b355-50a878860b16" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">William Bradley-King</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (EDGE-Baylor) will likely be a backup and special teams contributor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 7, Pick 246: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a Washington fan and someone that will be attending Penn State this fall, I love that </span><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/shaka-toney/3200544f-4e60-6812-6fcf-c48d8c87261c" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Shaka Toney</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (EDGE-Penn State) is heading to DC. Like Bradley-King, Toney will likely be a backup or primarily contribute on special teams.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Round 7, Pick 258: </strong><a href="https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dax-milne/32004d49-4c75-5745-8754-e10630234ec7" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Dax Milne</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (WR-BYU) could be decent. Milne was Zach Wilson’s top target at BYU, and hopefully that carries over to D.C when he’s catching passes from Ryan Fitzpatrick, Kyle Allen or Taylor Heinicke.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Washington deserves a B in this draft because of Jamin Davis, Sam Cosmi and Dyami Brown; as those positions needed to be addressed. Washington still needs a quarterback of the future, and could have traded some of their later round draft picks to acquire one. Besides the three aforementioned players, not many of these selections will have that big of an impact.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	33425
33350	The outgoing MCPS superintendent discusses the future of final exams, countywide tech access for students, and recommendations for his replacement.	<p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Jan. 14, Montgomery County Superintendent of Schools Jack Smith announced his upcoming retirement, tentatively scheduled for June 1. In his public video, Smith said his two-year-old grandson recently received open-heart surgery, and Smith thus intends to move to Maine to help care for him. </em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Feb. 3, Anika Seth, Leila Faraday, and Marijke Friedman of Silver Chips Print and Luke Sanelli of Silver Chips Online spoke with the superintendent about his impact on MCPS, the district’s biggest upcoming challenges, and recommendations for the incoming superintendent.</em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith began his tenure as MCPS Superintendent on July 1, 2016. During his 41-year-long career as an educator, Smith taught middle and high school English in Washington state, served as a middle school principal in and ultimately superintendent of Maryland’s Calvert County, was the Maryland State Department of Education’s chief academic officer, and acted as the interim statewide superintendent for a year. Notably, in 2013, Smith was named the Maryland Superintendent of the Year.</em></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33349"></div><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Friedman (Silver Chips Print): Which developments in MCPS have you been the most proud to watch happen? And what are you personally most proud of?</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I think in MCPS, we've shifted away from a culture of scarcity and more to a culture of abundance. When you think about equal opportunity, schools’ work around Advanced Placement in all high schools. When you think about the 21st-century career and technology programs we've instituted, like aviation and many others—we went from having half the high schools having computer science-based career/technology programs to all of them having those. And when you think about the change in the Magnet programs at the elementary and middle schools, the increase in the number of dual-language programs across the county. When you think about efforts like CREA (the Career Readiness Education Academy) to support our students who are immigrants and students who come late to schooling, at the seventh or ninth or eleventh grade oftentimes with disrupted education. That doesn't mean we can’t offer the opportunity to get to that high school diploma as well as career certifications and other kinds of support.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All those are just examples of moving from what I called a culture of scarcity. What I'm most proud of in MCPS is that shift. And that certainly is an equity-driven shift, because it means that you have more opportunities for all students and you really look at students who, as a group, based on race or culture have had fewer opportunities. Some students in every race and culture have had lots of opportunities. The problem is that, essentially, white and Asian students have had more. If 60 percent of the Hispanic/Latino students have had this opportunity and 90 percent of the white and Asian students have had it, the goal here is not to lose what we've done for the 60 percent here, but to raise it up so nine out of ten of </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">all</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> students get the opportunity. Then, we still work for that last 10 percent to get everybody to that place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Faraday (Silver Chips Print): Is there anything that you wish you'd done differently during your time as superintendent or is there anything that you regret?</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith:</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> I really wish that one of the things I talked about the day I walked in the door was expanding and extending the digital opportunities for all students—and that starts with connectivity. Instead, we had to have a worldwide crisis impose that on us. But think how much better it would have been last March 13 if we had already done that work, if we had already put a Chromebook in every student's hand, if we already made sure that we were making connectivity possible for every student, and supporting them, training and challenging every teacher to use those digital tools. So I wish we had done that sooner, and I don't have any good justification for why we didn't. I just paid attention to other things at that time. Because you always think well, we'll get to that later. And then all of a sudden, on March 13, there was no later. And it was hard for students. It was hard for adults. It's still hard, but it's gotten easier.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We have done a lot of looking at resource allocation so that the schools with the highest number of students in poverty get more resources. I regret that we didn't do more of that earlier. We did a research study my second and third year here, and that's really revealed a lot to everyone. But if I had known then what I know now, I would have started that resource study the first day I walked in the door because I think that also would have expanded that understanding of the need for digital accessibility, digital facility, digital capacity for everyone. Because let's face it: There's no place in our life that we don't use it. And why not let people work more flexibly and differently even when it's not a crisis, as long as the work is getting done? So I think if those two things, the digital work and resource allocation studies, if I had done them the minute I walked in the door, we could have accelerated a lot of what we've been going through.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Sanelli (Silver Chips Online): What are your hopes for the next MCPS Superintendent? What would you say to them?</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I would say that you can never have true excellence—and this is an excellent system, has been for decades—without full true equity. And you can never have equity without excellence. Who's ever heard of an equitable, mediocre school system? It just doesn't make sense. Tying those things together in everyone's mind will make all the difference for the students that come through the doors of MCPS schools in the years to come. It will. That equity is about making sure that everyone to the greatest degree possible gets what the school can provide, to ensure their education, ensure their sense of agency that I can do this, I have the efficacy, I have the confidence to use what I've learned and go out in search of opportunities in my life. And so you have to have both, you have to have both that confidence from being well cared for by your school and you have to have real knowledge, skills, understandings. Because when you walk out the door, and if you feel great, because we've done such a good job of caring for you, and you cannot read right, and think mathematically, you're going to be in a world of hurt, whether you go right into the job market, whether you go into some career licensure certification program, or you go right to a university, it doesn't matter. All of them can lead you to wonderful good places in the society. But if you're lacking those foundational skills, then all of the goodwill and good care we've provided is going to be lost as an adult when you're wandering around the community without any options. And so that's what I would say to the next superintendent: Guard everything. Don't just guard the learning, don’t just guard the well being. Build everything out and then make sure that the schools are delivering that sense of confidence, that sense of efficacy, and those skills, understandings and that care for the kids social, physical, psychological well being all at the same time, all the way to the day they walk off the stage with that diploma and go off into the world.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33073"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Seth (Silver Chips Print): As we're talking about students' social and emotional well-being, one of the things that came up this summer that was really major was the wave of allegations on social media about sexual misconduct in the district. Do you have recommendations for the next Superintendent about how to handle—and maybe better protect—student safety and well-being?</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Absolutely. One of the things that MCPS was really engaged in when I got here, and we've done a lot of work around it, is child abuse responsiveness. Now, the vast majority—like almost all—of the child abuse reports are from external sources. There are a very small number where adults in schools act badly. When we talk about child abuse, one of the things we've done is build a very systematic way, where everyone knows that we're actually following the systems and processes that we're supposed to follow—not just as checkboxes.&nbsp;Now, take that same line of thinking and apply it to circumstances in schools where adults behave in terrible ways or students behave in terrible ways toward one another. It's exactly the same line of thinking. You have to build systems where you're constantly checking that you have done what you need to do for every student.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">People say, ‘There are 161,000 students right now. Well, that's so many students; how do you do that?’ You do it locally, within the school classrooms, the school hallways, the school buildings, the offices across the entire district—so wherever it comes to, you have very tight parameters around you. You can't say, ‘Well, I don't know if this really happened or not. So I'm not going to report it.’ No. You report it. There's no if on that. And then in that process, you have ways to reach out to the student, reach out to the family, reach out to other staff members, and reach out to other agencies that help you do it. And then you constantly do that every single time, and then you check yourself. Are we doing it 87 percent of the time? Are we doing it 93 percent of time? That's not good enough. Are we doing it 98 percent of the time? That's still not good enough. That's a 100 percent issue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">You got to build really tight parameters. You got to trust people within those parameters to do the right thing. And then you have to go back and verify that it's actually happening 100 percent of the time. And when it’s not, I always call for—if it's a serious situation—for what I call a blameless autopsy. And a blameless autopsy means you go in, and you look at everything. We're not here to assign blame. Assigning the blame can happen somewhere else if somebody has really been derelict or indifferent or actually malicious in how they've treated something.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both the process improvement and responding to the individual's bad behavior together can make a 100 percent system if you do them and do them right. And we weren't. I’d be foolish if I told you we were because the evidence was brought forward. But I can tell you, we followed up on every one of those. And I got a weekly report on where we were on following up things. And it's okay if a bunch of them turned out to be dead ends because not all of them did. And that's the important part.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Friedman (Silver Chips Print): Looking back in the past, with the locker room rapes at Damascus, I know that MCPS contracted the law firm WilmerHale to look into the culture regarding sexual harassment. Do you think that was the right decision? Is contracting a study something that should be approached in the future, if there were more incidents like this?</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">: I do think those sorts of studies can really provide beneficial kinds of paths forward. I do. And with that particular study, it really caused us to step back and look at all 25 high schools and the after-school programs. Whether they were athletics or activities, doesn't matter. A bad thing can happen in a band room; a bad thing can happen in a locker room. We put a lot of processes in place that we were ready to implement because of that. Those will be in the budget for next year, or this spring as we try to bring the students back in the spring. We've not lost any of that work. Like so many things, if you have great trust and confidence in your environment and you become relaxed, then that's when people make careless decisions—or they make bad decisions, or they make horrific decisions. And you can't leave that place open for people to make really horrific or bad decisions. Careless decisions happen. And I can't talk a lot about it because, obviously, it's a litigation. But if you go back and look at the press conferences, you know that we held people responsible and said, “People made bad decisions in this case, and going forward, that can’t happen.” We have to have multiple layers—just like I was talking about a few minutes ago—checkpoints, and interconnected pieces, so that if somebody makes a terrorist decision over here, somebody else makes sure it's taken care of, so you don't wind up with a horrific decision.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Faraday (Silver Chips Print): Would you encourage the next superintendent to conduct these reviews when they take their position?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith:</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Absolutely. When you're dealing with human organizations, if you wait until it's broken, it's too late. So continuous improvement means, for human organizations, means to be constantly looking at where the weakness is, the failings, the places of vulnerability. And one of the ways to do that is to do these kinds of studies and say, “What are the vulnerabilities? What are the areas of danger for our students? And how do we make sure that we close those?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Sanelli (Silver Chips Online): What do you think is the biggest challenge that MCPS still has to face in the future?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith:</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> I think MCPS is going to have to continue to face two things. One is that MCPS has been really good for a long time. And so we tend to think, “Well, we're really good at that. So why should we go back and look at it?” Well, the world changes. And one of the things that I realized, around our earlier conversation with the digital work that I should have started earlier: I should have been looking at the world around us more closely and saying, you know, “I know we're doing 50 different things, but we're gonna start with this digital work right now, in July 2016.” Instead, we waited until it was forced upon us. And we'd been doing Chromebooks, we’d been doing Smartboards, but we were really good. So I didn't look at, “How can we be better in this era, right now, in the context of the world?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In March of 2020, around connectivity and digital tools, some students had everything. Some students had three devices on their desk at home. Some have one, some had one substandard device, some shared the device with six other family members. And some students had to go find someplace in the neighborhood to even get access, like a library, or a neighbor, or a friend. And then teaching adults how to use them, so they are using them in an appropriate way for the students they serve. That's one thing that I think MCPS is going to have to contend with: the idea that we're really good, so we don't need to be great. And the minute you think you're really good, you slide backwards because you're not working to go forward.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The other thing, and it goes right hand-in-hand with it, is something called&nbsp;“TTWWADI.” I've used that with all the administrators many times. It’s just a series of letters for, “That’s the way we've always done it.” But that is not a good reason for doing something now. Don't ever tell me, “That's the way we've always done it,” as the justification for doing it this way today. Tell me we've analyzed it. We've looked at ten different ways to do it, and the way we've done it for the last ten years is still the best way to do it. And I'm going to say, “You are a thinking person that really took your job seriously.” If you say, “This works, it’s what we've always done,” that's lazy thinking right there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Those are the two things that we have to battle against. Because tradition is good; we have to honor tradition. But tradition can become toxic, if we leave it too long—like this digital tools connectivity question.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Seth (Silver Chips Print): Before you became Superintendent, final exams were removed. But in the years since then, we've heard former board members, students, and teachers raise concerns about increased testing time, with things like the RQAs and PARCC exams. And former students have raised concerns about under-preparedness for college without that final exam requirement. Do you see a future for final exams coming back to the school district?</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I do. I think that the different kinds of final exams will continue to evolve. We're in a real period of transition right now. The challenge here is how do you know that students are getting what they need—including final exams—in an efficient and effective way so it doesn't take too much time? And how do you do it in a way that makes sense to students? I think the assessment question is going to change a lot. There's a good article from a year or two ago by this futurist who said pretty soon, final exams and state tests are not going to be necessary. Because that information will just be constantly collected about your progress so that every student will know all the time, how they are doing. And if you go look at some of the things that are happening with medicine, science, business, and manufacturing, that's what they're doing. They're constantly collecting all sorts of information, and then they can talk about the individual patient experience, or they can talk about a group of patients, or they can talk about this whole class of medical work that we do. I think the same thing is going to happen in education, that the whole conversation has shifted away from, “Should we give a one-hour or a two- hour final exam? Should it be four times a year or two times a year?” to being, “What do we know? Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semesterly, yearly around growth?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">That's where I think we're heading with testing. I think the next five years are going to be very interesting and very exciting. And I always tell civil rights advocates, “Don't give up on this.” Because if we lose the knowledge about how our students are doing, and how do we know, then disparities in learning and opportunity and access are going to be perpetuated. If you think about Advanced Placement, there's the gap of who takes the class and who doesn’t. But then look at the other disparities that exist: Which groups of students get a 1 and which get a 5? Not by individual, because my motivation level might be a 1, so I get a 1 because that's what I contributed to my own learning. But if you can predict by race or culture or income which group is going to get more 5’s and which group is going to get more 1’s, then there's something wrong in the system. You have to look not just at the binary who-gets-in and who-doesn't but then also at what happens when they're there.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>Friedman (Silver Chips Print): What do you hope to accomplish in the months before your retirement? And how do you feel about this chapter of your long journey as an educator coming to an end?</em></strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith:</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> I'm very, very sad. I had not planned to retire at this point. I'm just trying to cope with my own feelings about it. Frankly, I'd not planned to move to Maine—it's really cold in Maine! I like the weather in Maryland. It's hard; it really is very hard. But my goal is to leave the school system in the very best place I can leave it in and to make the absolute best transition for the next superintendent, the staff, the school board and the community that I can provide as we go forward. In my mind, there was no good time to do this because I didn't want to do it; I just needed to do it in a way that would be the best possible transition for the school system going forward. That's what I hope to do, and I'll keep working on that until I leave. Thank you for listening to me.</span></p>	33349
32137	The semi-finalists were acknowledged in a reception on Sept. 13.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sept. 13, Blair celebrated its 36 National Merit semi-finalists with a reception in the Career Center.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair is home to the second most semi-finalists in the county, the first being Richard Montgomery with </span><a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org/138-mcps-students-named-national-merit-semifinalists/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">39 semi-finalists</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Maryland's semifinalist cutoff score was the second-highest in the nation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Bryan Li, one of the semi-finalists, was surprised when he first saw his score. "There is some luck involved because you only take it once in 11th grade for the chance at NMSC and sometimes you get a problem that you make a mistake on," Li said. Compared to last year when three of Blair's semifinalists were finalists, Li feels there will be even more students moving through the ranks this year. "I feel like there are a lot of good people in our grade that have a chance at it," Li said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32132"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Of the 1.6 million high school entrants who took the PSAT, around 16,000 qualified as semi-finalists. This year, the semi-finalist cut-off score was </span><a href="https://www.compassprep.com/national-merit-semifinalist-cutoffs/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">222</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, one point less than last year's. Blair produced fewer semi-finalists compared to last year's 42 semifinalists. Each year, approximately 15,000 semi-finalists move on to become finalists, winning $2,500 from the National Merit&nbsp;Scholar Program along with other outside scholarships.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The list of finalists will be released to the schools in early February.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32132
32337	Blazers celebrate D.C.’s thrilling ride to the top of Major League Baseball	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When Washington, D.C. won its first baseball championship in 95 years in late October, they unified an otherwise politically polarized city. Instead of talking about impeachment and the 2020 elections, Washingtonians were singing “Baby Shark” and chanting “finish the fight.” The World Series brought to the DMV a wave of excitement that only a sports championship can bring.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32336"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair students showed their Nationals pride the morning after the game seven win, flooding into the school decked out in Nats apparel. Although both students and teachers stayed up to catch the game’s thrilling end at midnight, the mood certainly did not reflect the fatigue they felt. Teachers and students congratulated each other all day, their spirits high after finally experiencing a rewarding postseason.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair is home to many long-time Nationals fans who have been waiting for this moment since the team’s first season in 2005. Sophomore Calvin Tobias, who witnessed the team win it all at the Four Corners Pub across the street from Blair, is has been a fan since the start. He watched every game this postseason, and says his favorite moment of this year’s playoffs was “when Howie Kendrick hit a grand slam in game five of the National League Division series.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though some Blazers tracked the Nationals’ rise to the top throughout the season, others tuned in for the first time for game seven. Senior Amelia Frey, though not a huge baseball fan, found it exciting to watch the Nationals win and celebrate alongside some of her baseball-loving family. “It was really exciting to watch. I think it was the only game that I actually watched and I don't want to be a fake Nats fan,” Frey said. “But it was really exciting to see them win and to see how D.C. united after that.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair English teacher Keith Anderson said that the evening of game seven involved a lot of screaming at the TV while watching the game by himself at home. Anderson, who is from New York and grew up a Yankees fan, has been a Nationals fan since he moved the area in 2005 and was surprisingly emotional when the Nats clinched. “My attachement to the Nationals is that I moved to D.C. the same year that they did. I went to a bunch of those RFK games when they were really, really bad,” Anderson said. “You realize that when a team is local to you, even when you don’t consider yourself a diehard fan, they are connected to you in ways that you don’t imagine.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Diehard baseball fans enacted all of their superstitious rituals on championship night. While players sported their </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alex-bregmans-smelly-shirt-washington-nationals-love-baby-shark-here-are-some-superstitions-1468159" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">lucky shirts and uniforms</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, fans carefully calculated their own actions in front of the TV. After the Nationals scored while he was standing, junior Jacob Yokoyama pledged to stay standing for the rest of the game. Other fans planned their actions at the watch party at Nationals Park. Junior Yujin Sasaki carefully switched seats in the stadium hoping that it would inspire a comeback. All of this superstition must have worked, because by the end of a long night of extremely coordinated movements, the Nationals had secured a baseball championship.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fans are undoubtedly eager for spring's arrival to hopefully see the beginning of another successful season of Nationals baseball. Until then, the D.C. area will be riding the wave of glory that the 2019 Nationals team brought home to Washington.</span></p>	32336
32539	The Blazers beat the Barons by a score of 54-43	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (7-1) beat the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Barons (5-1) 54-43 on Friday night. The Blazers came back strong after their loss to Sherwood on Wednesday night, beating a team that they have lost to in previous years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The game opened with Blair winning the tipoff and junior guard Kate Hildebrant making a three-pointer. However, B-CC quickly retaliated with six points of their own. Their players quickly set up plays that left Blair lagging behind. Blair put on a strong show defensively, but they struggled to find scoring opportunities. Freshman guard Natalie Frost and senior guard-forward Lucy Martin made numerous rebounds and intercepted B-CC’s passes, but most plays were left incomplete due to hasty passes and failed shots. With 11 turnovers, 10 deflections and little offensive success, Blair could not catch up. In the last five minutes of the second quarter, Blair was unable to make even a single basket. By halftime, the Blazers were trailing 23-20.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32538"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Halftime was a critical period for Blair as Coach Amy Ferguson strove to change the team’s mindset and outlook. “We just had to play Blair basketball. We were playing really selfish in the first half and we knew that we could beat every girl one-on-one. I just told them that that’s not how we were going to beat them. We needed to move the ball to get the flow going,” Ferguson said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior captain and guard-forward Peyton Martin also reflected on her weak performance in the first half of the game. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“I was kind of sick today, so I wasn’t expecting myself to do well. I didn’t set standards for myself and I had a really poor first half. When we went to the locker room, I was told to set higher expectations for myself and believe in myself as a player who is capable. In the second half, I just wanted to demand the ball and score,” Peyton Martin said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The score deficit increased in the beginning of third quarter, but the Blazers persisted with drastically improved passes and communication. Freshman guard Amelia Martin’s steal near the end of the quarter marked the start of Blair’s comeback. “I think it energized my team a lot because when I got that steal it made the rest of my team think that if they press girls then they can get steals and then they can get points. If you make that scoring opportunity for yourself by stealing the ball, it rewards you in a whole different way, ” Amelia Martin said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers increased their aggression as they pushed to close the 33-31 deficit in the fourth quarter. Peyton Martin’s free throw and subsequent two-pointer helped Blair finally pull ahead of B-CC with 6:45 left in the game. After that, the Blazers pushed to maintain the lead. As B-CC grew frustrated, they made more and more mistakes that kept the ball in Blair’s control for the majority of the quarter. By fouling, double-dribbling and travelling, the Barons allowed the Blazers to add 23 points to their score over the quarter. Blair’s powerful defense limited B-CC’s points to 10. This led to Blair’s ultimate 54-43 victory at the end of the night.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Peyton Martin concluded that a major part of the team’s victory was their determination to win on home court. “Friday night is basketball night and we don’t lost on basketball night,” she said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, January 17th against the Paint Branch Panthers at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	32538
33388	This emotional Disney film will bring a tear and a smile to the most hardened movie watchers, as it promises that a better world can be possible	<p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Warning: This review contains slight spoilers for “Raya and the Last Dragon.”</em></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33387"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Raya and the Last Dragon,” Disney’s latest animated adventure directed by </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, is a heartwarming film that fully explores the damage that a lack of trust can cause. The film was highly anticipated, originally set to release Nov. 25, 2020 before the pandemic caused schedules to shift. When it finally released March 5 on Disney Plus, it managed to wow audiences.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The plot of “Raya and the Last Dragon” is deeply centered around the themes of loss, trust and unity. The main character, Raya (Kelly Marie Tran), lives in a world that used to be called Kumandra, before greed and anger split it into five parts; Talon, Tail, Spine, Fang, and Heart. Before the split, dragons lived alongside humans, but the menace of the Druun</span><span style="color: rgb(77, 81, 86);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">a mindless force bent on destruction</span><span style="color: rgb(77, 81, 86);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">forced them to sacrifice themselves for the humans. 500 years later, tragedy strikes when Raya is tricked into leading an enemy to the gem that protects the world, and the world once again is under the threat of the Druun. This forces Raya to travel the world, learning to trust again to confront the betrayal that she faced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Raya herself is a fascinating character, with much more depth than one might expect. She is a warrior, but also deeply flawed, with trust issues stemming from the night when a Fang girl, Namaari (Gemma Chan), betrays her trust; this inadvertently results&nbsp;in the Druun being released. As she battles Namaari and her own inability to truly see the good in people, Raya grows and changes. She makes friends, including Boun (Izaac Wang), a plucky boy sailing the river, and Sisu (Awkwafina), who help her&nbsp;see different sides to people. The found family trope enables the audience to really care about both the emotional and physical journeys of the characters, leading to the incredibly emotional climax of the film.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This climax feels well deserved, as Raya’s journey leads up to it in a satisfying way. As Raya travels the world on this journey, the audience is also able to see the beauty of the five different lands, each loosely based on a region of Southeast Asia. Whether it’s the mountain-dwellers of Spine, or the antagonistic Fang living surrounded by water, the animation is crisp and clear, making&nbsp;the world really come alive. Every detail in the film is lovingly crafted, with even the water and individual plants seeming perfectly crafted. The titular last dragon, Sisu, is animated in an aesthetically pleasing way, truly evoking the feeling of a water dragon, and the Druun look suitably menacing. Disney has made great strides in 3D animation over the last few years, and nowhere is it more clear than this film.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Raya and the Last Dragon” also has an extremely engaging and catchy soundtrack.&nbsp;It is composed by James Newton Howard, who has scored over 100 films including “The Dark Knight” (2008) and “King Kong” (2005), as well as all of the Hunger Games movies. The soundtrack takes inspiration from Southeast Asian music, given the setting of the film, and fits the movie perfectly. The lack of any traditional Disney songs may upset some, but the tone of the film is improved due to the omission, as Raya is not the type to break out into song.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With the release of the film, many people have questioned the relationship between Raya and Namaari. While obviously complicated due to betrayal and a lack of trust, many also view it as romantic, given the many flirtatious lines between the two and their chemistry together. The voice actor for Raya herself seems to share these thoughts, stating in a </span><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/03/raya-and-the-last-dragon-kelly-marie-tran-gay-namaari-raya" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Vanity Fair article</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that she felt there were “some romantic feelings going on there.” Of course, this is never explicitly stated, as Disney is first and foremost a corporation designed to generate profit and they have decided that subtext is the best way to get the money of both the LGBT community&nbsp;and those who do not support them. “Raya and the Last Dragon” is the latest in a series of Disney movies, toeing this line, which includes “Frozen 2” (2019).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Putting aside Disney’s shortcomings as a corporation, the movie is quite simply wonderful to watch.

33306	How Blair has risen to the challenge of feeding the community.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When the bell rang at 11:00 a.m. on a normal school day, the lunchtime rush began. Students made their way to the Student Activity Center (SAC), forming long cafeteria lines as they waited to receive their food.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tNow, however, students enjoy their lunch break from home. Some students make use of the MCPS meal distribution program and join a different line—one in the Blair parking lot.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tCOVID-19 and the school closures that followed have posed unique challenges for the Blair community, especially those that relied on the school for their meals. These students are hardly alone, as the Food and Environment Reporting Network finds that nationwide food insecurity has more than doubled during this pandemic.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33305"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMCPS has responded by implementing socially-distant meal distribution centers at 74 locations countywide, and Blair is one of them. This process began in mid-March and has continued since; by the beginning of August, MCPS had provided over 4 million bagged meals for free to students and children under 18, according to the Bethesda Beat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBlair Cafeteria Manager Christine Blanton says that on the busiest days, she leads her staff in distributing over 3,100 meals. She knows her regulars, explaining that many people rely on the program. “That's a family that you know is in need of food,” she says, “[because] they don't miss a day. Rain or shine, they're here.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBlair Principal Renay Johnson says that the endless line of cars during the weekend rush represents a positive asset to the community. “Just seeing the traffic, the line to get into the school to get the meals… I know it’s a good thing and I know we’re serving the community,” she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tJohnson wants students to be able to prioritize their education without concern over basic necessities. “It shouldn't even be any stress. You should come to school, and we should be able to feed you breakfast, lunch, and dinner,” she explains. “You just focus on learning.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn the 2019-2020 school year, 33.3 percent of Blair’s 3,223 students received Free and Reduced Meals (FARMS) while at school.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLocal organizations are also distributing meals, as the wider Silver Spring community has come together to keep Blair families fed. Manna Food Center, Silver Spring Cares, Small Things Matter, and other non-profits have stepped in to make food accessible.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tRoxanna Yamashita, the CEO of Small Things Matter, explains that their efforts expand food accessibility beyond just students, as COVID-19 and corresponding economic challenges continue. “[The food we distribute] is supplemental to other people in the community that might not be able to access [school] meals,” she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWhile Johnson points to the MCPS program’s successes, Blanton feels there is room for improvement. Blanton is unsure whether the short lunch break, which is 75 minutes, is enough time for students to pick up lunch from the school, return home, and join their classes punctually. She also points out that some students do not have the means of picking up meals at all. “Not everybody can drive, not everybody has transportation,” she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBlanton thinks that MCPS should have school bus drivers deliver food to low-income communities. “You will get out more food that way,” she explains, “versus trying to have people come up here to get food because people still [need to] work; they're trying to hold on to whatever little bit of job that they have.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMarla Caplon, the MCPS Director of Student Wellness Initiatives, agrees that having a system of delivering meals would further increase their accessibility: “My concern, you know, has always been making sure that folks get food, but what about those folks that can't come out?”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFarzaneh Nabavian, Blair’s Parent Community Coordinator, explains that the families making use of these services are grateful for the program despite its imperfections. The efforts to help those in need during the pandemic have changed the lives of all involved, Nabavian says. She believes this meal program should remain in effect even after schools return to in-person learning.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThough Nabavian thinks preserving food distribution services is paramount, the future is uncertain. Johnson explains that free meals are only guaranteed for the community until the end of the calendar year. “I think we have to see what the budget is,” she says. “We'll see what's allocated from the federal government for school lunches and school meals.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEven if MCPS schools reopen and meals become easily accessible to students again, Johnson agrees with Nabavian that the program should remain in place. “[Free meal distribution] is a great service for the community, so I hope it continues through the school year,” she says. “Hopefully school leaders, as well as government officials will realize [that] just because kids go back to school, families may still be unemployed.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFor now, Johnson says that these long lines at Blair show the extent of the community’s need—which will likely persist for a long time. “When there’s no line, then we’ll know it’s okay.”</span></p>	33305
33415	The director’s cut of the 2017 disappointment is also a disappointment	<p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The hype for the “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” film was real. It’s as if for the past several years, fans were fighting the good fight against Joss Whedon’s disaster in order to see Zack Snyder’s original vision. And Thursday, March, 18, they finally got that vision. And the reward fell short of their effort.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For background, Zack Snyder was the original director of “Justice League” before conflicts with Warner Brothers and the tragic death of his daughter (whom he dedicates the film to) caused him to leave the film. Joss Whedon, director of “The Avengers,” was brought in to finish it, and the rest is history. Eventually, fans waged an online war to give </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">their </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">director a chance to finish </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">his </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">movie. And if the fans were fighting out of sympathy for Snyder following the loss of his daughter, it would actually be quite touching. And perhaps they were. But if they were fighting for the release of a significantly better movie, it only speaks to how atrocious the original “Justice League” was. Because despite every fan’s best effort, the Snyder Cut is, at best, ok.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Zack Snyder is known for divisive superhero films, not masterpieces. His most notable works as of late are “Man of Steel” (2013) and “Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice” (2016), both of which were not well-received by most critics. Granted, lots of fans enjoyed them, but they were nowhere near the level of “The Dark Knight” films, DC’s holy trinity in terms of filmmaking. Rather, they were kind of “eh” with some sporadic cool scenes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">And the “Snyder Cut” falls into this “eh” category quite well. The film tells a story in which Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Superman (Henry Cavill) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) must team up to protect Earth from conquest by villains Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), Desaad (Peter Guinness) and Darkseid (Ray Porter). All of the performers do rather well, though some of the villains are not given very much to work with.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The fight scenes, particularly towards the end, while CGI-heavy, are entertaining. They scratch the fan urge to see all your favorite childhood superheroes kick some serious butt on the big (well, due to current circumstances, small) screen. The treatment of the characters is also surprisingly balanced, as nearly every team member gets some time in the spotlight or is important to the plot in some way. The villains are not quite so lucky</span><span style="color: rgb(77, 81, 86);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Darkseid in particular. Considering how heavily he was teased in the Snyder Cut trailers, it’s disappointing to see how inconsequential he actually is to the overall plot.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33414"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For the most part though, that’s where the strong suits of the movie end. And the flaws far outnumber these positives.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Just like the last superhero crossover epic to grace the big screen: “Avengers: Endgame” (2019), “Justice League” is too long for its own good. Way too long. There is no good reason for a film to be four hours long. Especially considering that nearly nothing of importance happens in the first half. Instead of good pacing, the film instead includes excessive slow-motion and an extremely diverse color palette that ranges from dark grey to mud brown. The film practically </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">begs </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">to be taken seriously.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">But its quest to be taken seriously has two major flaws. The first is that the movie itself struggles to find a coherent tone. One minute everything is dark and moody, and in the next, The Flash is cracking jokes about hot dogs. It’s not that a serious or dark film can’t have comedic elements, they can and should. But at times, this movie thinks itself so serious and joyless that its humor doesn’t balance the film, it detracts from any kind of cohesive tone. Additionally, while its seriousness may help set the film apart from its MCU contemporaries, it also makes “Justice League” far less fun in the process.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, the most disappointing thing about Justice League is the final scene, the one in which Jared Leto makes his return to the DCEU as Joker. The three-minute scene itself is not disappointing. Rather, it’s that this one scene between Ben Affleck’s Batman and Jared Leto’s Joker is far more interesting than the nearly four-hour movie that precedes it.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2 stars.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Zack Snyder’s Justice League” is rated R for violence and some language. It is now available to stream on HBO Max.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33414

31980	The best performances based on acquisitions and their future impact	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">June 30, the first day of free agency for the National Basketball Association (NBA), marked the beginning of what has been the most tumultuous and groundbreaking offseason in NBA history. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We saw a lot of teams make huge advances in their hopes of winning the Finals, and a lot of teams fall short of expectations. Teams like the New York Knicks had dreams of signing players like Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard, but failed to even offer those players contracts. However, teams like the Los Angeles Clippers acquired two superstar players just a year after earning the eighth seed in the Western Conference.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Here are the top 10 NBA teams based on their 2019 offseason performance, and how their moves this offseason will affect the franchise's future as a whole.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">10. Utah Jazz</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 50-32, 5-seed in West, lost in first round vs. Rockets</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although Utah lost Raul Neto, Ricky Rubio, Derrick Favors and Jae Crowder, they brought in Mike Conley in a trade with Memphis, and signed Bojan Bogdanovic and Jeff Green, two players with some veteran scoring ability. Utah selected forward Jarrell Brantley, who averaged 15.5 points per game (ppg) and 5.0 rebounds per game (rpg) in summer league, in the second round and could help the team cope with the loss of Favors in the future.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">9. Houston Rockets</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 53-29, 4-seed in West, lost in conference semifinals vs. Warriors</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Rockets gave Oklahoma City two first-rounders and two pick swaps as well as Chris Paul to reunite Russell Westbrook and James Harden. This combination is seemingly deadly on paper, but their play styles are much different than when they played on the Thunder, so we'll see how they complement each other. Other than that, not much has happened for the front office in Houston.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">8. Atlanta Hawks</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 29-53, 12-seed in East, missed playoffs</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Atlanta has continued to build their solid young core, adding three rookies—Cam Reddish, De'Andre Hunter and Bruno Fernando. The Hawks also added veteran support with acquisitions of forwards Evan Turner, Chandler Parsons and Jabari Parker. While they did lose Dewayne Dedmon and Kent Bazemore, key returners such as John Collins, Trae Young and Kevin Huerter give the Hawks a beautiful young core to build around for years to come.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">7. Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 37-45, 10-seed in West, missed playoffs</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Los Angeles finally followed through on the rumors from the trade deadline and acquired Anthony Davis, sending Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and De'Andre Hunter to New Orleans. They also sent Jemerrio Jones, Isaac Bonga and Moritz Wagner to the Wizards. The Lakers then signed DeMarcus Cousins, Danny Green, Jared Dudley, Avery Bradley and Quinn Cook. They re-signed JaVale McGee and Rajon Rondo, keeping two solid, veteran players on board to support LeBron and AD.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">6. Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 51-31, 3-seed in East, Lost in Conference Semifinals vs. Raptors</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Sixers were able to sign the only center in the league that could stop Joel Embiid: Al Horford. They brought in Josh Richardson to replace Jimmy Butler, signed Kyle O'Quinn and Raul Neto and acquired Matisse Thybulle from the Celtics on draft night. Philly was also able to re-sign Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, James Ennis and Mike Scott.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">5. Oklahoma City Thunder</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 49-33, 6-seed in West, Lost in First Round vs. Trail Blazers</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The big news is that Russell Westbrook and Paul George were both traded away in blockbuster deals, and since draft night, Oklahoma City (OKC) has acquired an astounding eight first-round draft picks for future NBA drafts. They now have 15 first-round picks through 2026. In these trades, OKC also acquired Chris Paul, Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. These changes will be great for the future of the Thunder, as the Paul George-Russell Westbrook combination didn't fare too well in the two years they played together, losing in the first round both years.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">4. Golden State Warriors</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 57-25, 1-seed in West, Lost in NBA Finals vs. Raptors</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The big move that everyone is excited over is the sign-and-trade deal to bring all-star guard D'Angelo Russell to Oakland. Of course, losing Kevin Durant is a huge loss, but bringing in another younger scorer like Russell can help in the long run. While they did lose DeMarcus Cousins, they replaced him with Willie Cauley-Stein, who put up great numbers last season, and signed Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson as a short-term relief for Klay Thompson's torn ACL. The Dubs gave Draymond Green a big extension contract to keep Green's superb support all around the court. Golden State re-signed Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney, and selected guard Jordan Poole with their first-round pick, who did an astounding job in summer league with 17.8 ppg.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">3. New Orleans Pelicans</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 33-49, 13-seed in West, missed playoffs</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although New Orleans traded away their superstar player in Anthony Davis, they gained plenty of young talent to cope with that loss. They drafted Zion Williamson with the first pick, then acquired Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart through the Anthony Davis trade. The Pelicans also acquired two other first-rounders, Jaxson Hayes (16.3 ppg and 7.3 rpg in summer league) and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (24.3 ppg and 6.0 assists per game (apg) in summer league). In addition, NOLA grabbed some great veterans in J.J. Redick and Derrick Favors.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2. Brooklyn Nets</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 42-40, 6-seed in East, Lost in First Round vs. 76ers</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rumors that Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving joining forces started when a video of the two talking surfaced on social media during the 2019 All-Star weekend. Lo and behold, the Nets acquired Irving, Durant as well as DeAndre Jordan. They did sign-and-trade D'Angelo Russell to the Warriors to acquire Kevin Durant, but in the long run, this made the Nets a contender to win the NBA Finals in the coming years. In addition, Brooklyn signed stable role players in Taurean Prince, Garrett Temple and Wilson Chandler.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1. Los Angeles Clippers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2018-19 season: 48-34, 8-seed in West, Lost in First Round vs. Warriors</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Clippers made two huge moves, acquiring NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. In the trade for Paul George, Los Angeles gave up Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and an array of picks. The Clippers re-signed Patrick Beverley and Ivica Zubac. With Beverley, George and Leonard, LA will have one of the best defensive teams in the league. LA also acquired Mfiondu Kabengele from Brooklyn on draft night, and he has been putting up 17.0 ppg and 7.8 rpg in summer league.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This offseason, we saw seven of last year's all-stars switch teams, whether it was through a trade or signing. We are seeing a lot of young talent being moved, as well as a lot of veteran players joining new teams. We are also seeing one of the best draft classes this season with players that will make immediate impacts on their teams. We saw the defending NBA champions lose their Finals MVP just a month after winning the Finals. Overall, this has been and will be the craziest and most impactful offseason the NBA has seen.</span></p>	31979

There do seem to be some minor quirks that are worth investigating before purchase, but this tool could change the note-taking game, virtual learning or not.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=noise+cancelling+headphones&amp;i=electronics&amp;crid=3BU57YAOA2WHV&amp;sprefix=noise+c%2Celectronics%2C178&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-a-p_1_7" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><strong>Noise-Cancelling Headphones</strong></a></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If you’re having trouble focusing and want to block out distractions, this is the product for you. Apple just released their AirPods Max for $549, a device which offers a plethora of advanced noise-cancelling features (at least one can hope looking at the astronomical price). However, for those of us wanting to spend that money elsewhere—such as the </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/why-blair-students-shouldnt-buy-the-ps5-at-its-release-32972/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">costly PS5</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> that appears relatively cheaper by comparison— there are also several budget-friendly options that will do the trick.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=hp+stylus&amp;i=electronics&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><strong>Stylus for Touchscreen Device</strong></a></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A stylus simulates the action of writing on a piece of paper, which used to be an everyday occurrence. Now entirely virtual, junior Jyotsna Bhatnagar recommends investing in a good stylus (if you have a touchscreen device) to complete assignments with the same ease. “Earlier, I had one of those pens that had a touchscreen stylus at the other end, but I bought an HP pen because it didn’t suffice,” Bhatnagar says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When drawing-based paper packets are converted to Canvas assignments, frustration mounts because trying to illustrate using a mouse or touchpad is incredibly tedious. Similarly, printing a piece of paper and marking it up, only to scan it again feels like an unnecessarily arduous endeavour. A stylus tackles both concerns: it can be used to draw in Kami assignments, annotate on Zoom, and more. “The stylus helped me with drawing maps in [AP World History], labelling diagrams in Anatomy and other classes because, basically, I could turn in assignments online that would normally be necessary to do on paper,” Bhatnagar added.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="http://amazon.com/s?k=computer+monitors&amp;crid=I9H02WT91O83&amp;sprefix=computer%2Caps%2C174&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-a-p_5_8" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><strong>Large Monitor</strong></a></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Similar to blue light glasses, the purpose behind this purchase would be to alleviate eye strain from prolonged computer use. A larger monitor is usually brighter, sharper, and of a higher resolution. It may also inadvertently help with slouched posture, as the greater screen size would raise your eye level.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ultimately, all you truly need for online school is yourself and your computer. However, if you’re looking for holiday gift ideas or a way to improve your learning experience, why not consider something off this list? Each product is tried and tested by Blazers, as well as other students all over the Internet. And at bare minimum you’ll be going to your 2021 Zoom classes entertained and in style.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33172
33109	Updates on upcoming events and other information for seniors	<h3><strong>Graduation and prom</strong></h3><p>On May 23, Principal Renay Johnson confirmed that a virtual graduation will be held on Thursday, June 11, at 12 p.m., followed by various in-person celebration ceremonies that will take place once restrictions for large gatherings are lifted. This decision took into account feedback from over 8,000 students and families through a survey.&nbsp;</p><p>For Blazers, caps, gowns, and tassels have arrived and will be distributed from May 26 through May 29. All information can be found <a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/4/blog/post/edit/3035589981066893120/9163801832330219507#" target="_blank">here</a>. <strong>If you have any material(s) from Blair, like textbooks, cameras, or musical instruments, that need to be returned, follow the procedures in the link above.</strong>&nbsp;MCPS has yet to decide whether or not prom will be postponed or cancelled.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past couple of months, MCPS shared three potential graduation options with stakeholders and sought opinions from high school students in a survey.</p><p>The first option was to postpone the traditional graduation ceremony until late July and hope that public health guidelines evolve to permit large gatherings.&nbsp;</p><p>The second option was to have a virtual graduation; however, students would be unable to videotape themselves due to MCPS privacy policy, which states that individuals may only collect, use, and disclose information regarding students and their families if it is for educational, instructional, administrative, and business purposes. A virtual graduation does not fall under these guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>Many students also do not have access to internet connection or devices with which they could participate in the virtual graduation. As of May 8, MCPS had distributed over 60,000 Chromebooks and over 5,000 MiFi’s—mobile WiFi hotspots—to students, but technical malfunctions are inevitable and some students may still not have access to the technology needed to participate. Another possibility within the virtual graduation option was a drive-in movie event, but, again, equity concerns stymied efforts, as some families do not own cars.</p><p>The third and final option was to have a virtual graduation, but also invite seniors to visit their high school the following year for a class celebration similar to a homecoming; this was the final decision.</p><h3><strong>Celebratory yard signs</strong></h3><p>Blair administration, parents, and student volunteers distributed yard signs to members of the senior class that displayed a “Congratulations Class of 2020” message in bold writing on May 4, with silhouettes of students with caps &amp; gowns in Blair’s signature red and white colors.</p><p>Principal Johnson had posted four layout ideas—designed by fine arts resource teacher Jacqueline Armstead—on Instagram and Twitter on April 19, asking seniors to vote for their favorite.</p><p>According to Principal Johnson, the senior class sponsors ordered signs for over 700 members of the senior class, and the PTSA will cover the costs for all of them.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Yearbook distribution and other information</strong></h3><p>Yearbooks are expected to arrive around late June or early July according to Jostens, the company that publishes the yearbooks.</p><p>Families have until June 5th to add a $10 shipping fee to their order if they want the yearbook shipped to their home.

33422	The SRO work group needs to amplify student voices and encourage healthy discussion between them and the SROs themselves.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Last June, the MCPS Board of Education established a committee which consisted of five high school students of color and 20 adults to review the county's student resource officer (SRO) program and suggest alternatives to it. The work group was marred with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mcabrutality/status/1349022069200195585?s=20" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">allegations from its student members</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> that it had "actively ignored" their perspectives during the meetings and failed to consider relevant data on the SRO program and its alternatives. MCPS SROs have also claimed that their voices have been ignored during the county's debate on whether to remove the program. It is imperative that the work group includes the voices of more student members of color and more student resource officers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to the </span><a href="https://www.law.umaryland.edu/media/SOL/pdfs/Programs/ADR/STPP%20%20RP%20Commission%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Maryland Commission on the School-to-Prison Pipeline and Restorative Practices</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Black and low-income students were disciplined more severely and more frequently than their peers, even though the study "failed to find racial differences in student behavior."&nbsp;</span><a href="http://marylandpublicschools.org/about/Documents/DSFSS/SSSP/StudentArrest/MarylandPublicSchoolsArrestDataSY20182019.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">MCPS’ arrest data from 2018-2019</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> reveals that 78 percent of all SRO arrests were made against Black or Latinx students, while they make up only 21 and 32 percent, respectively, of MCPS's student population. The SRO program disproportionately arrests students of color, but the County Council and Board of Education have taken no concrete action to address this, while they simultaneously claim to support racial justice.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Student resource officers say that they have a genuine desire to be role models for students. Captain Flynn, a former SRO and current Director of Community Engagement for the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) says that it "cuts the SROs to the heart" when students say that they feel unsafe around them. Although SROs are central to our county's discussion of Bill 46-20, they feel like they aren't being included in the conversation. "The SROs feel that they have no voice… like a lot is being talked about them," says Flynn. Flynn also feels that it is unfair to label the SRO program as racist. "It's frustrating because we're not the ones making those decisions on arresting students. We're doing it at the direction of the school," Flynn says.&nbsp;MCPS protocol relies on SROs to initiate a "paper arrest" against the student by writing an incident report and sending it to the Department of Juvenile Services. Perhaps the issue with the SRO program has more to do with </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/pol/Resources/Files/SRO/MCPD-SRO-FAQ.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">schools relying on SROs </a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">to police offenses like drug possession, drug distribution, and fights that could be handled using restorative justice.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The work group would also benefit from looking at legitimate data on the SRO program and its alternatives. According to Kyson Taylor, a student member of the work group, "We (the group) didn't examine the right data, so I don't really understand how we could have made a decision or made recommendations," he says. According to a </span><a href="https://go.boarddocs.com/mabe/mcpsmd/Board.nsf/files/BX3TVP6E4949/$file/Student%20Arrest%20Data%20SRO%20Program%20210112.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Jan. 12 memo </a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">that Jack Smith (then MCPS Superintendent) wrote to the Board of Education, it does not appear that the work group discussed sources that were critical of the SRO program, such as the </span><a href="https://www.law.umaryland.edu/media/SOL/pdfs/Programs/ADR/STPP%20%20RP%20Commission%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">previously-mentioned 2018 report</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> that found racial disparities in Maryland's arrest data.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maraki Solomon, another student member, corroborates Taylor's claim. "I don't think that [the work group] ever had an intention of truly changing the way that MCPS structures the SRO program… or even considering the removal of it," she says. How can the work group come up with alternative solutions to the SRO program if the majority of its members won't even consider changing it?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After the work group's failure to meet its goals of coming up with alternatives to the SRO program, the Board of Education moved the deadline for the group's final recommendations from Dec 2020 to May 2021. If Montgomery County's leaders want to put their money where their mouth is, they will ensure that the SRO work group gives MCPS students greater representation on the committee, examines the necessary data, and provides concrete recommendations to address the program's racist impact</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33421
32257	The event showed kids the exciting side of math and science	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Oct. 25, Math Honor Society (MHS) and Science National Honor Society (SNHS) hosted Blair's first STEM Night to introduce elementary schoolers to fun math and science concepts.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MHS members had been thinking about STEM Night since the end of the last school year as a math-only event. However, when SNHS took an interest, MHS saw it as an opportunity to broaden its reach. "Initially it was just going to be a math night, but then Science National Honor Society seemed interested in helping out, so we branched out into a STEM night instead of just a math night," MHS sponsor and Blair math teacher Grace Contreras said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The two honor societies set up different tables with activities ranging from building molecular structures to performing egg drops. When deciding what activities to offer, members thought back to the STEM activities they had enjoyed. "I remember going to these kinds of things myself as a middle schooler or elementary schooler. I remember the strawberry DNA activity and thinking it was the coolest thing ever, so hopefully, they enjoyed it as much as we all have," Amanda Liu, senior and co-president of SNHS, said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the busiest tables at the event featured slime-making. Slime is a popular item among children, and SNHS members taught kids the chemical reactions and science behind the product. Another popular activity was the egg drop table, where students tried to build a structure that would keep an egg intact as it fell from a large height. It allowed kids to get hands-on with a project and see a direct impact from concepts explored.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MHS and SNHS members were expecting a smaller turnout but welcomed over 100 parents and students throughout the evening. Some materials ran out as a result, but the organizers saw this as enthusiasm for the event. "We ran out of some things at stations, which is incredible, I never imagined that would happen," Contreras said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32255"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The organizers were focused on making STEM enjoyable for kids through the event. "I hope that elementary school children find some fun in doing math since it might be seen as something boring or tedious when you're a bit younger," senior and MHS member Jimena Alvarez Gonzalez explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many parents also actively engaged with the activities, encouraging their children to join in. "The parents are really involved. There are parents with hats on their heads, building molecules," senior and MHS officer Ipsa Mittra said at the event. Many of the parents who attended tried to foster an interest in math and science in their kids from a young age. "I try to get to as many STEM events as possible, and I enjoy coming with my daughter and having her be engaged," parent Deandere Boggan said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both SNHS and MHS are hoping to do more community outreach in the future. "We're excited about where we're going, since this is something we've been talking about for a while and now members are talking about other service opportunities that we can create for this coming year," Contreras said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Editor's note: Amanda Liu is an opinions editor for Silver Chips Print</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32254
31744	Blazers rallied at the Capitol Building on March 15 as part of the International Climate Strike	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31743"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">On March 15, students from around the area attended a rally for climate action at the United States Capitol. The rally was part of the International School Strike for Climate. At 9:30 a.m., Blazers gathered at Blair and marched down Colesville Rd. to the Silver Spring metro station. As they walked, they chanted “Hey hey, ho ho, fossil fuels have got to go,” “What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now!” and “Stay united, fight for our climate.” They made their way to the Capitol Building grounds, where they listened to speakers and performers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Bella Garfield, a junior who takes AP Environmental Science at Blair, said that the environmental issues she has learned about this year motivated her to strike. “I’ve always been passionate about the environment. I think it’s really important for us to start taking a stand for our future because we’re the ones who have to deal with this," she said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31745"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Blair sophomore Jordan McAuliff is involved in the Montgomery County chapter of the Sunrise Movement and helped organize Blair’s attendance at the rally. She is passionate about the intersectionality of the movement and hopes she can continue working with others across the world to take action. “I’m really passionate about how intersectional this issue is and how climate change affects people of color disproportionately,” she said. “Hearing people tell those stories and explain why this so specifically matters to them is so inspiring.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Sophomore Rekha Leonard also attended to speak up for government action. “I’m here because I think it’s ridiculous that people in our government don’t even think climate change is real, and I want to change that,” she said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Speakers at the rally included Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Isra Hirsi and Havana Chapman-Edwards (known as the Tiny Diplomat). Chapman-Edwards called for climate activists to be inclusive in their advocacy, citing her experiences of climate injustice around the world. Others called for teens to oppose corporations contributing to climate change. "We must not let the current administration prioritize corporate interests over the health of all of our communities," Omar said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31746"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">A number of student organizers also spoke. “In 11 years, the damage from climate change can not be reversed, and that is something I simply choose not to accept,” Karla Stefan, 14, said. “It is so great to see so many young lives committed to making change... we are the next generation of voters, the next generation in congress and the last generation to reverse the effects of climate change. We have no choice but to be the generation that creates change,” another speaker said. Strike co-director Haven Coleman, 12 called on the protesters to act now to avoid future mass displacement.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Between speeches, students participated in call-and-response songs and chants led by the student organizers of the strike. “Let them hear us!” the organizers chanted. “We strike for a planet on which we can live and prosper. We are the first generation that will be impacted by climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">The strike ended with 11 minutes and 49 seconds of silence to represent the 11 years left to take climate action and to remember the lives lost in the March 14 Christchurch mosque shooting. At 1:30 p.m, students left with a final chant as the rally dispersed.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">Many strike participants hope to continue their activism in the future. "We want to change this climate crisis. Even if you're tiny, your voice is not, and you can change the world one step at a time," Chapman-Edwards said after the rally. Maddy Fernands, a sophomore at Edina High School in Minnesota, also wants the climate action movement to maintain momentum. "I think we're going to keep striking until something is done," she said. "We won't accept anything less than what's necessary," she said. </span></p>	31743
32817	Einstein student displayed a gun during an online class session	<p>On Friday, April 3, a 17-year-old Albert Einstein High School student was reportedly holding and playing with a gun during his distance learning session on Zoom. In response to the incident, both MCPS and the police are taking measures to ensure online learning safety.&nbsp;</p><p>This incident marks just one in a series of disruptive events on Zoom. In recent weeks, as institutions have transitioned to video conferencing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of Zoom has increased significantly, and with it,&nbsp;“Zoom bombing.” Zoom bombing is a popular trend in which students hack into Zoom lessons and disrupt the class. Other incidents have included the sharing of hateful images, pornography and threats through Zoom. Senior Bernadette Hargrove explained how she feels about these incidents, “I think they were trying to be funny, but obviously the intent of the perpetrator isn't necessarily what matters in a threat,” she stated.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32816"></div><p>MCPS has enacted severe punishment for such behavior including suspension, expulsion and even criminal charges.&nbsp;</p><p>The police determined that the Einstein student was not a threat to any school staff or students and will not bring any legal charges against him. During the investigation, the police questioned the student and his parents and found that the gun was purchased legally. No further details were given on the police investigation. Regardless, Albert Einstein will be taking disciplinary actions against the student.&nbsp;“I am deeply disappointed by this behavior,”&nbsp;wrote Albert Einstein High School’s Principal Dr. Christine Handy In an email to Montgomery County families.&nbsp;</p><p>In the aftermath of this incident, both MCPS and Zoom are taking precautions and implementing regulations in order to keep online learning environments safe. “ I do think that schools should be more careful with their zoom lessons and only allow students to turn on their camera and mics when directed by a teacher,” said Hargrove.&nbsp;Moving forward, students have to log into their MCPS account in order to join an online learning session. This means that students cannot join Zooms anonymously like they previously could. Moreover, Zoom meetings require secure login passwords and codes in order for students to join the class. Other, more secure platforms for online learning are being explored as an alternative to Zoom.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	32816
32875	Students from several schools in MCPS recently posted sexual harassment and assault allegations on social media	<p><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">Since Sunday, June 21, multiple students from both Montgomery County high schools and middle schools have made sexual harassment, abuse and assault allegations against their classmates on social media.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">According to </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/schools/mcps-police-investigating-dozens-of-sexual-assault-and-harassment-claims/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Bethesda Magazine</a><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">, students from at least 12 schools have made allegations, many of whom attend Blair. Bethesda Magazine reported that an MCPS spokeswoman told them the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) will be leading the investigation into the allegations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">Several students expressed concerns about the administrative response from Principal Johnson on Twitter and Instagram. Some students later reported that they had been blocked.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">On Friday, June 26 at 3:43 p.m., Blair Principal Renay Johnson sent an email to the Blair staff explaining that she contacted the police and central office officials when the allegations were first brought to her attention. "My staff and I have called families and conducted wellness checks on students. I have been in close contact with the police and central office staff to address Blair students’ allegations," Johnson wrote.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">In a </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/publicinfo/community/school-year-2019-2020/community-message-20200626.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">letter</a><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;"> sent home, MCPS Superintendent Jack Smith encouraged parents and students with information regarding cases of sexual assault to contact the MCPD and the </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/hhs-program/bhcs/vasap/vasapindex.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Victim Assistance and Sexual Assault Program (VASAP)</a><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">, and also provided victims and their families with additional phone numbers to contact for </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mbhsSCO/status/1276628647907143683" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">support</a><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55); background-color: transparent;">On Sunday, June 28, Johnson released a letter for Blair families.

32378	The Blazers lose 68-62 to the Cougars	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair boys' varsity basketball team (0-1) lost to the Thomas Stone Cougars (1-0) by a score of 62-68 in their first game of the season on Friday night.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After winning the tip-off, the Cougars took possession of the ball and raced towards the hoop, but could not score. Junior guard Michael Ayala caught the rebound and passed it to junior guard Alfred Roy Worrell, who drove to the basket. Despite getting fouled, Worrell managed to make a three-point play and brought the Blazers up 3-0 in just the first minute of the first quarter. A Stone player slammed into Ayala and he made the free throw, bringing the score to 4-0. Blazers in the stands went wild seeing their players start off strong.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32380"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the Cougars stole the ball back and made a three-pointer, bringing the score to 4-3, Junior center Tommy Waltz-Chesnaye took command of the ball, shooting a two-point field-goal with Worrell as assist. To rally for more points, the Cougars went for the goal, but Worrel caught their rebound and dashed to make a two-pointer. Halfway through the quarter, Stone's coach called a time-out, with Blair leading 8-5.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As soon as the game resumed, a Stone player fouled Ayala. Ayala made a free-throw, raising the score to 9-5. After flashes of rebounds, junior guard Jacob Briggs took the ball and assisted it to junior guard Roman Cannuscio, who made a three-pointer. Stone started with the ball and made a two-pointer, bringing their score up to 12-7. Although the Blazers' lead was narrowed to 12-9 by two free-throws from the Cougars, Ayala took a two-pointer. Through a series of goals and free-throws made by Cannuscio, Worrell, Ayala and Stone players, the first quarter ended with the Blazers in the lead 20-14.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The second quarter marked the ascent of the Cougars. After minutes of trading possession of the ball, the Cougars made a three-pointer and then quickly snatched the ball from the Blazers to make another two-pointer. The Blazers lost the ball once more, and the Cougars brought their score to up 20-22. Throughout the second quarter senior guard Liam Olagbaju, Waltz-Chesnaye, Worrell, Cannuscio and Briggs scored, but the quarter came to a quick finish with a score of 34-36.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The third quarter was very intense with Blair regrouping to catch up to Stone. The two teams shared blows, and the score was very close. Worrell, Waltz-Chesnaye and Cannuscio brought in points for Blair, but in the end, the Cougars made several free-throws, ending the third quarter with the Blazers down 47-51.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The fourth quarter had the most fouls and time-outs as the players hurried to bring victory to their respective teams. In the first three minutes of the last quarter, the Blazers struggled to score a point, while the Cougars brought their score to 47-55. Finally, Olagbaju grasped the ball from the Cougars and made a two-pointer, sending the Blazer audience into a happy frenzy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, this frenzy did not last as Stone continued to take the lead to 49-58. In the final three minutes, with the help of a foul from the Cougars, Ayala made both free-throws. The Cougars went on the offensive once again but their efforts ended in a rebound which Ayala took to the hoops, bumping Blair to 57-60.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers lagged again as the Cougars brought their score up to 57-66 with only 30 seconds left in the game. Briggs intercepted and scored a two-pointer. He was fouled and made his first free-throw. Worrell made both free-throws after an aggressive foul from the Cougars. Alas, the Blazers were rushing in the last seconds, but the Cougars ended the game with a two-pointer, bringing a loss to the Blazers 62-68.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers took lessons from their shortcomings in holding back the Cougars. Coach Damon Pigrom thought this loss was mainly due to the lack of familiarity between players and the coach. "It's only been three weeks since we started and the other team is a very strong team that usually contend[s]... for states," Pigrom said. "We need to work as a team to trust and get more familiar with each other, not just between players but also between coach and player." The Blazers will try to work on their team chemistry to avoid close losses like these in the future.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game on Monday, Dec. 16 against the Quince Orchard Cougars at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	32380

"We are going to have another weird supply chain situation as the pandemic surges and more businesses are affected. We'll need to purchase more food and seek additional storage space to store the excess food. Those are two of the main challenges, but we have the support," Martin says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Individual donors funded over half of Manna's budget in Fiscal Year 2020.

Since the county's schools closed last March, Nabavian has provided food and other essential goods to the families and students of Blair, Takoma Middle School, and Rolling Terrace Elementary School who are in desperate need of help. When the pandemic first hit, her cell phone was flooded with messages from students who had lost their jobs and were living on their own, unable to feed themselves.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33254"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"When it [the pandemic] first happened, everyone was struggling to get help… At the very beginning, I was lucky enough to connect with Silver Diner [a local restaurant chain] through a non-profit, so I was actually picking up 60 to 100 meals a week and distributing it to families that needed it. I could have done more, but I just did it once a week. I did that on my own time," Nabavian says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Now, she says, she provides food and support to families of all backgrounds and situations.

Police have stated that no report was filed for these alleged break-ins and Arbery was found to be unarmed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Arbery's case did not attract much attention until May 5, the day the video of his murder was released. Overnight, his story caused a nationwide outcry to bring justice to his death and to punish those responsible. Two months after the murder, the McMichaels were arrested and charged with aggravated murder and assault. The delay was allegedly due to the Brunswick District Attorney, Jackie Johnson, who was accused of not allowing the arrest to go through. She has denied this claim and blamed the local police for the decision of their delayed arrest.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32865"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Arbery's family described him as a hardworking, generous, kind-hearted young man.

33113	Disclaimer: This information is updated through June 1.	<p>Ever since the COVID-19 began in China in December 2019, humanity has scrambled to find ways to treat the disease. When a novel disease emerges, treatment often comes in three steps: life support, anti-virals, and vaccines.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Mild cases</strong></h3><p>To understand how to treat a virus, it is important to understand its nature. As a virus, COVID-19’s sole objective is to reproduce and make copies of itself by infecting the human body, then transmit by bouncing from person to person.</p><p>During these first few hours of infection, the virus spreads from the air to the nose to the throat and the lungs. This is the disease’s&nbsp;<em>incubation period</em>, a time when the virus’s spread in the body is limited.&nbsp;</p><p>The onset of the disease is marked with mild symptoms similar to those of the common cold: fever, coughing, sore throats, etc. At this stage in the infection, common flu medicines like Tylenol can be used to treat the symptoms of the virus by suppressing the fever, clearing the throat, and making the sickness more bearable.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33111"></div><p>In fact, at this stage in the disease, fighting it off without any further treatment is plausible given how mild the symptoms are. Additionally, due to the state of healthcare facilities, with limited test kits and overburdened first responders, self-care at this stage is the medically recommended method to prevent further transmission.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Symptom progression</strong></h3><p>One of the mysteries of COVID-19 is its variability in impact. Some patients' symptoms are mild and dissipate with self-care. In other cases, however, symptoms worsen, often to the point of severe shortness of breath. The body then begins to work tirelessly to stop the advance of the virus. Symptoms of pneumonia begin appearing as the immune system tries to contain the virus. The infected lung cells become inflamed, secreting fluid to hinder the virus from spreading.&nbsp;</p><p>This viscous fluid coating lowers the amount of oxygen patients take in. Patients find it difficult to breathe and must gasp for breath. Those who test positive often get admitted to hospitals at this point, and their symptoms and a variety of conditions, such as blood oxygen levels, are monitored.</p><p>Internal levels of oxygen in the blood allow medical professionals to track how efficiently a patient is breathing. If the oxygen levels drop below 93 percent (only 93 percent of blood cells are saturated with oxygen), suffocation is imminent and patients are put on ventilators as life-support.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Lack of life-support</strong></h3><p>Due to their massive demand and medical necessity in saving advanced cases, ventilators have become increasingly hard to come by for those on the verge of suffocation. Medical manufacturing companies are working overtime to meet the ever-growing demand for ventilators. But they aren’t the ones producing these lifesaving machines.</p><p>President Trump has invoked the Defense Protection Act to increase the production of critical supplies. These quarantine laws are fairly new to all. “This is the first time in 50 years that quarantine laws have been used,” Scott Becker, CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, tells Ishaan Shrestha from Silver Chips. “Generations of public health officials had never used this.”&nbsp;</p><p>Although these quarantine laws are new for everyone, all walks of society are doing their best to help out. Car companies with large factories, mass production experience, and connections to the supply chains necessary for the hundreds of parts that go into a ventilator have done their best to adapt to the situation. General Motors received almost $500 million in government contracts to produce 30,000 ventilators by August. Similarly, Ford teamed up with GE Healthcare to produce 50,000 ventilators by July, and Tesla is repurposing its car parts to create its own model of a ventilator.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the FDA has loosened its regulations on ventilators, new models have been appearing all over the country. Universities like MIT and Vanderbilt are open-sourcing their designs, for instance, so that manufacturers around the world can use them.</p><p>Others aim to modify existing ventilators to be more efficient. Engineers from the University of South Carolina and medical engineering company</p><p>Prisma Health’s VESper ventilator project are sharing plans for a 3D-printed device that can allow one ventilator to be used on two patients.</p><p>Massachusetts General Hospital anesthesia residents are hosting the CoVent-19 Challenge, a contest for “rapidly deployable ventilator” designs to incentivize hobbyists and locals to join in the fight against the pandemic.</p><p>Even in high schools, students are searching for solutions to address the shortage. Some members of Blair’s robotics team have worked ventilator designs using computer-aided design (CAD) software.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33112"></div><h3><strong>Accessing anti-virals</strong></h3><p>Ventilators by themselves aren’t a cure to the disease. If symptoms worsen and no biological treatment is administered, intubation (invasive ventilators) may become necessary to ensure the proper flow of oxygen into the patient's bloodstream. However, the mortality rate at this point in the disease’s progression becomes very high as the immune system begins to lose control of itself.</p><p>The T and B white blood cells, the “commanders” of the immune system, control specialized Interleukin-6 (IL-6) white blood cells by marking which cells are healthy and which are viral. When the immune system begins to get overwhelmed with millions of viruses, the production of IL-6 spirals out of control, creating a “cytokine storm.</p><p>Overwhelmed with so many viruses, the cytokines (key proteins released by the immune system) lose the ability to properly recognize which cells are viral and the immune system begins attacking the body’s own organs. The immune system turns on itself, soon leading to organ failure.</p><p>In order to avoid this, hospitals have begun to administer different sets of treatments to patients before reaching this stage. The FDA has not approved any universal treatment, but dozens of experimental drugs are in the clinical trial stage of production.</p><p>Drugs deemed safe for clinical trials by the medical national Institutional Review Board––those not yet deemed safe for use by the general public––are tested on infected patients to ensure their effectiveness and monitor side effects. Each drug attacks a different part of the virus' reproduction process.&nbsp;</p><p>Hydroxychloroquine, the drug President Donald Trump has controversially endorsed due to the adverse effects noted by some studies, is one of many experimental drugs targeted at blocking the interaction between the virus and healthy cells. These types of drugs would ideally trigger a slowdown in the cell’s response to antigens, reducing the reproductive ability of the virus.</p><p>Remdesivir, another drug taking the media by storm due to its touted effectiveness, imitates the viral genetic material and sabotages the viral reproduction process, stopping the virus from spreading within the body. Existing drugs like Talampicillin and Lurasidone are being repurposed to prevent the virus from injecting its genetic material into the healthy cells in the first place.</p><p>Despite how well these solutions sound in theory, results from clinical trials are yet to be published, and safe, widespread commercial usage is still a ways off.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Looking at the long-term</strong></h3><p>For long term prevention, vaccines are needed to prevent another outbreak. Along with the clinical trials for drugs, clinical trials for vaccines have begun as well, with several labs across the globe gaining notable steps in the right direction.</p><p>Despite working toward similar goals, not all of these labs are taking the same paths, as dozens of vaccines are being produced through different methods: harvesting “elite” patients’ antibodies (injecting the antibodies from a patient who successfully fought off COVID-19 into another patient as medicine) or traditional dead viral presentation (injecting dead COVID-19 viruses into our immune system, like how the flu vaccine is delivered).</p><p>But since determining the effectiveness of a vaccine requires a very large sample size and long time frame, experts estimate that the earliest vaccines could be released to the general public within a year.</p><h3><strong>In the meantime…</strong></h3><p>As the disease continues to progress, we can stay informed by following the constant updates in the news.</p><p>“It's smart [that the] Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene work very closely with local health departments like the Montgomery County Health Department to push out information in quarantine,” Becker from the Association of Public Health Laboratories says. “We can keep the mountain of American people informed through journalists.”&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone can do their part by staying informed, self-isolating, quarantining, washing hands, and maybe even participating in a ventilator contest.</p>	33111
32813	From reusing old materials to printing FDA approved designs, Blazers make face coverings for the COVID pandemic	<p>As the need for masks rises and the supply itself dwindles, Blazers have taken up a role in supporting their families, communities and health care workers by making protective gear at home. From designs as simple as reused fabric masks to high-tech 3D printed covers, students are using the materials they can access to fight against infection.&nbsp;</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that each person use at least a&nbsp;simple face covering to prevent further spread of the virus in public settings. As surgical masks and N-95 respirators are reserved for health care workers and first responders, homemade face coverings are a low-cost, effective alternative to stay safer.&nbsp;</p><p>Juniors Iris Gupta and Yalissa Scott are sewing homemade masks made after research on the internet. Both families are sewing masks for extra protection based on their circumstances. Scott says that her family has been layering various fabrics, old scarves, blankets and reusable bags to make protective masks for when her mother goes to work on a regular basis. "This is important because we are minimizing our effect [on the community], making sure that we're not one of the causes as to where the virus is spreading," Scott says.</p><p>While the biggest challenge for Scott is to find usable fabric around the house, her family makes sure to sew together at least three layers for each mask to minimize aerosol penetration.&nbsp;</p><p>Gupta adds that she is using old T-shirts to create masks for her parents, who are at high risk due to underlying conditions. She not only wants to protect her family as they leave the house, but she believes that the homemade masks will inspire passerbys. "It'll inspire people to make them at home, knowing you don't have to go out and buy them," Gupta says.&nbsp;</p><p>She explains that the process is simple: she cuts the T-shirt into a mask shape and secures string at each end of the mask to fit around the ears. Gupta believes it is only a matter of inspiration and motivation that others will realize they can save money and resources but switching to homemade masks.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32812"></div><p>While Gupta and Scott utilize old fabrics they have at home, Sophomore Matthew Calderon is helping his mother sew together masks for her business, Anytime Alterations. With his mom being a seamstress, the family has a plethora of fabrics that can be used to sew strong masks. "[We make the masks] mostly on demand, and on a good day we get around 50 done," Calderon says. Customers are supporting the local business in exchange for protection. Like Gupta and Scott, he emphasizes the reusable feature of his mother's masks: the fabric allows users to reuse them after a round in the washing machine.</p><p>Having access to better technology due to his commitment to robotics, Sophomore Arjun Oberoi is currently operating seven 3D printers to print parts for face shields; his family owns multiple printers, and Blair engineering teacher John Kaluta is supporting Oberoi's plan by operating printers from school. He is donating some of these face shields to a company called Open Works in Baltimore and giving the rest to family and community members.&nbsp;</p><p>Oberoi employs his interest in 3D printing to support workers at risk of getting infected.

32179	Starting in September 2020, students will have new options when taking the ACT and reporting their scores	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Oct. 8, American College Testing (ACT) announced in a </span><a href="http://leadershipblog.act.org/2019/10/act-test-to-provide-new-options.html?_ga=2.35897955.250908740.1571159244-1276728004.1571159244" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">press release</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that beginning with the September 2020 ACT administration, it "will introduce individual section retesting, online testing on national test dates and superscore calculations." The ACT is a standardized college admissions exam that consists of four mandatory multiple choice sections (reading, writing, math and science) and an optional writing portion. The changes, made based on student, parent, teacher, counselor, administrator and education official feedback, will benefit future ACT test takers.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32178"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The new ACT policy allows students to retake individual sections of the test, but this can only be done</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> once a student has taken the full exam. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Combined with superscoring, the retesting policy is beneficial to students because they only have to focus on one section at a time, rather than having to study for four sections at once.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Superscoring is a policy that several colleges and universities already implement, but with the new changes, the ACT itself will calculate students' superscore to send to schools. It combines students' highest score from each section across all test dates into one score sent to colleges. This increases student scores, and in turn, their chances of getting into more selective schools.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Judy Goldstein, who plans to take the ACT this spring, sees advantages to the retake policy since it could help her boost her math score. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I'm not really that confident in my math skills, so if there's a chance for me to be able to retake the math section I think that could be really good for me," she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Goldstein has a mostly positive outlook on the opportunity to superscore test results. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">My initial thought is that [superscoring] would help. I do wonder what the negative consequences are, especially because I'm not the only one that's going to be doing that," she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some argue that the drawbacks of the changes outweigh the benefits. </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/college-board-asks-for-too-much-31800/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">One major concern</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is that retesting provides wealthy students even greater an advantage in standardized testing than they already have. The ACT has yet to announce the fee for individual section retakes, but the price will not hinder richer students from retaking individual sections as many times as they would like, which is something that most low-income students cannot afford to do.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Currently, students can use up to two fee waivers that cover the cost of an ACT administration with or without the essay in addition to late fees. The organization has yet to announce updates to the waiver to accommodate the new testing changes. If it is updated, the changes will mitigate worries about wealthy students gaining as much an advantage as some fear.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The third and final change is giving students the option of taking the test online or on paper. Previously, students had to take the test on paper and wait about two weeks to receive their scores. Taking it online, however, will let students receive their scores as early as two business days after the test date. The ACT anticipates many benefits to receiving score reports earlier. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This allows students to make better, more informed, and timely decisions about the schools and scholarships to which they apply," it said in the press release.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Students who choose to take advantage of these new policies will have enhanced opportunities to improve their scores, which should help them become more competitive applicants to selective colleges and universities.</span></p>	32178
32883	Some lasting thoughts of a graduating senior	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dear Class of 2020,</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We walked into Blair as freshmen in Sept. 2016, completely unprepared for what the next four years would bring us. I remember being nervous about entering high school, adjusting to Blair’s block schedule and finding my place in such a large school.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yet here we are! Four years have flown by, and it’s definitely ending on a different note than we could have ever imagined. High school was a roller coaster of a ride—we made new friends, studied late into the night, learned to drive and became role models for the underclassmen. We toiled and we thrived, and we grew up. At the back of our minds, we constantly looked forward to the bliss of second semester senior year.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I don’t know what you all expected for our last month of high school, but I had in mind something straight out of the movies: dancing the night away at prom, thanking my teachers for everything they’ve taught me, rediscovering the meaning of friendship at beach week, and finally, turning the tassel on my cap at our graduation ceremony. The COVID-19 pandemic has stripped all of these experiences from us.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It’s okay to be upset, angry or frustrated. We have worked incredibly hard in high school to reach this point, and it is devastating to lose the opportunity to celebrate with our friends and family. However, it’s important to recognize that the pandemic cannot take from us the memories we’ve made in Blair’s halls. Despite not receiving the closure you imagined to your high school career, I hope you will remember the good times you had at Blair and feel proud of all of your successes.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pandemic aside, I’ve had the best four years of high school. When I come back and visit Blair, I will be even more thankful for what it has given me. I’ve experienced a firehose of joy, tears, memories and nostalgia, and wish I could do it all over again. But at the same time, I’m so glad that my freshman year self is behind me, and I’m looking forward with excitement to the future. There are so many amazing experiences lying ahead of all of us, just waiting to be discovered.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To everyone I’ve met at Blair, thank you for being a part of my life and shaping my high school experience. To the Silver Chips Online family, it’s been an honor to serve as one of your Editors-in-Chief alongside Sam for the past year. To the Class of 2020, whether you are heading off to college, entering the workforce or still figuring out the next chapter, I wish you the best of luck in the future as we all move on together to grander things.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sincerely,</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Emmy</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32881"></div><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32881
33115	Shortened virtual AP exams do not allow students to demonstrate subject mastery	<p>Many students looking for academic challenge or to lift the impending weight of student loans value the opportunity to earn college credit in high school. Advanced Placement (AP) exams began in the 1950s as a way for students to take college-level classes while attending high school. Currently, they serve as a means to skip introductory college courses in favor of those more specific to one's interest.</p><p>This year, students not only took AP exams from the comfort of home, but in a fraction of the previous three hour time limit. These limitations extend to restrict the number and type of questions on the test, and even the content covered. While the College Board, the for-profit “non-profit” that has monopolized the standardized testing industry, would like to believe that their blissfully shortened 45-minute AP tests will be enough to demonstrate students’ mastery of a subject, this is simply not the case.</p><p>Each AP exam consisted of one or two free-response questions, administered with multiple measures to detect plagiarism. But one question cannot adequately assess the many skills that students have learned throughout the entire course of the year.</p><p>For AP English Language and Composition, for example, students spent the entire year preparing for three essay prompts and approximately 55 multiple-choice questions. Now their exam has been shortened to one of those three essays, previously the one that students most commonly skipped. It is reasonable that the College Board has selected the most commonly skipped prompt because students should be able to demonstrate proficiency in all of the essay questions; however, the previous exam gave students the flexibility to prioritize different writing styles and thus provided a more comprehensive overview of individual students' capabilities.</p><p>These exams are also problematic because the College Board promised not to include several units for most classes. The reason for shortening the material on tests was to account for the fact that students would mostly be on their own to self-study the remaining material under extremely unfamiliar circumstances.</p><p>However, missing units on the exams allude to an even bigger problem with the possibility of granting college credit to current AP class-takers. The US Government and Politics exam only included information from units one through three of a five-unit curriculum. Colleges should not blindly accept that students have an understanding of the inner workings of their own political system based on a course that was only halfway taught and tested.</p><p>The reason colleges offer credit for AP classes is so students can receive credit for or test out of introductory courses. Then, by the time these students enter college, they can partake in a higher level course load.. In this way, colleges help students stay engaged in their education by exempting them from re-learning subjects they already understand. But introductory courses build the foundation for further knowledge, and without a strong foundation, there's not much building that can happen. By losing three months of essential learning, students are missing out on a strong basis necessary for their future college courses.</p><p>Further, students who took AP courses in high school and took the corresponding introductory course in college find the experience different from high school, often more engaging. Chaminda Hangilipola, a former Blazer who graduated in 2018, retook English Literature and Composition as a freshman in college and not only enjoyed the class more, but also performed better because of the more welcoming classroom environment. “I didn't talk at all in that class [in high school], because I was afraid I might get laughed at,” he said, “whereas in college, I was one of the main people who answered questions or talked.”</p><p>While college classes are not necessarily better than high school APs, they do entice tuition-paying students to make the most of their classroom environment. With different class sizes and teaching methods, college provides a different way to learn material covered by many AP courses that is sometimes engaging in new ways.</p><p>These concerns regarding the validity of this year’s exams and coursework are exacerbated by a much larger problem with online exams: cheating. With an entire realm of electronics at their disposal, from phones to tablets to computers and beyond, students had endless opportunities for collaborating test questions throughout the exam.</p><p>The College Board claims that though the tests are open note, no points will be earned from content that can be found online or in textbooks, but this is specifically the content that students are supposed to know after taking an AP course. The College Board also will be monitoring social media and potentially spreading misleading information about the test to deter cheating. These two methods for minimizing cheating are far from adequate, especially considering the inability to monitor student calls and collaboration throughout the test.</p><p>In addition, the College Board plans to send free-response answers to students’ AP teachers to verify academic integrity, depending on how familiar the teacher is with each of their hundreds of students’ writing. But not only is this an unreliable method, especially for those who have a new teacher this semester, it also would not be applicable for the thousands of students who self-study for exams and never take the class in the first place.</p><p>While it is understood that dishonesty will never fully disappear from the academic atmosphere, the ease of cheating on such highly valued tests should raise questions about the weight they hold in determining a student's capabilities. Hangilipola views AP tests as a benchmark that helps colleges foster a student’s specific learning environment, so this year’s test insecurity calls into question their value in assessing an individual's academic standings.</p><p>“You're taking these tests so colleges can understand the basis of your knowledge, just you, no external help,” he said, “Taking it at home, you have so many resources [that] you could use to cheat and present yourself better than what you really are.”</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33114"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">These unregulated work environments call attention to inequalities between households. Many students live in very disruptive environments, required to watch over siblings or listen to parents working down the hall or in the same room, where finding a place to quietly work and concentrate is certainly a challenge. While the whole world may be required to adjust to this time of remote learning, it is not fair to assume the students have adjusted so well that a 45-minute free-response exam will be manageable without the proper environment and materials.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“It's really hard when [my younger brothers are] always trying to come in my room and tell me stuff and talk to me,” junior Shalom Tsegaye said, alluding to a reality many students around the country have been faced with over the past couple of months: finding an environment conducive to learning while at home can be hard. “Sometimes during the day, I have to help take care of them and watch them, so that can be kind of hard to juggle.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although the College Board has worked hard to make sure students have the technological means to take their exams, delivering electronic devices and WiFi hotspots, the 2020 exams no longer hold their prior cumulative nature. The reduction of their length and scope should reduce the value that they carry for college officials.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Under normal circumstances,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/04/study-up-scoring-ap-credit-for-college-isnt-easy.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(209, 35, 42);">86 percent of top colleges</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;in America restrict granting of AP credit—this number should increase now that the standards for the test itself are lowered. The original goal of AP’s was to enhance student learning and engagement, not rush students through the knowledge of a chosen subject. Giving credit under these circumstances would be a mistake.</span></p>	33114
33153	Why MCPS shouldn't offer their health curriculum to students over the summer	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When Norah Lesperin, a sophomore at Albert Einstein, took health over summer break to get the required graduation credit out of the way, she encountered hateful comments about her identity and a sexual assault lesson so insensitive that it made her feel nauseous.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many students feel that health is too tedious of a course to take for an entire semester, so MCPS provides a shortened version of the class over the summer. Unfortunately, the abridged lessons often breeze through important topics that merit more discussion than the three-week class allows and give teachers less time to form bonds with their students.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">By promoting a quick and easy alternative to the regular health class during the school year, MCPS contributes to the dangerous notion that health is an unimportant throwaway class. “The way that the curriculum is set up, it’s more about completing the tasks. It’s less about understanding the ideas,” Blair sophomore Anna Uline said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The rapid nature of the course creates a disconnect between teachers and students. Lesperin said that she felt unsafe during a health lesson over the summer about LGBTQ+ identities when another student commented in the chat that they do not believe gay students face bullying.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“To me, as an LGBT student reading that, I was like, ‘oh no,’</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">but it moved too fast for the teacher to read it, and she didn’t respond,” she said. “Suddenly, I felt that it was my duty to help this kid understand, but there was nothing I could do, and it then made me really uncomfortable knowing I was in a class with someone who might possibly think that gay people lie about being bullied. It was a nerve-wracking moment.”&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33152"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Educators like Barbara Contino, a current Richard Montgomery teacher who has taught health for 23 years, feel that the compressed schedule does not permit enough discourse. “I need more time to build a better relationship with some of my students so there can be more communication and overall sharing,” Contino said. Online summer health, however, doesn’t provide her with that time.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When the curriculum is condensed, teachers must condense a semester’s worth of information into a few weeks—and unfortunately, key information is lost. “The biggest challenge teaching over the summer is finishing the curriculum in a very short period of time,” Contino furthered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lessons that would have been taught and discussed over a period of a few days during the school year are reduced to meaningless modules that students often ignore. “There was one Zoom lesson and then a couple of articles [about LGBTQ+ identities] that the teacher put on MyMCPS classroom,” Uline said, “[but] I didn’t do them because there were no worksheets to go with them.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When we graduate, odds are that knowing how to solve for x in a complicated algebra equation or the date of the Battle of Gettysburg will never cross our minds again. Health, however, is crucial—think first aid, eating a balanced diet, and phone numbers like the suicide prevention hotline. But when these topics are taught over the summer, they are severely rushed.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lesperin and Uline both referenced a worksheet that was assigned to students taking health this summer titled “Preventing Sexual Aggression.” The first question on the assignment asked students to list three ways to avoid being the victim of sexual assault.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lesperin was infuriated by the lesson. “I was horrified. I was angry,” she said. “What if someone in the class was a victim of sexual assault and ended up thinking it was their fault because of the lesson?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Uline, who is a survivor of sexual assault, shares Lesperin’s sentiments. “The sexual assault unit... I found [it] very offensive,” Uline said. “I am a victim of sexual assault, and the unit was full of victim-blaming. It made you write out how to prevent being sexually assaulted.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">That part of the unit was removed after students complained, according to Uline. However, the fact that it was assigned in the first place, with no follow-up lesson to clarify consent or apologize for blaming survivors, demonstrates the serious consequences of shortening the course.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MCPS should require that all students take a full semester health class. While students may find this tedious, this is the only way to ensure that the subject is treated with the gravity it requires. A full semester gives students the opportunity to thoroughly engage with the material and discuss it in a safe space—characteristics that are not guaranteed during the summer course.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If students are interested in taking extra classes over the summer to satisfy graduation requirements or earn more credits, let them take the courses that cover material that won’t matter in a life-or-death situation. Health is too important to be given only a cursory three weeks and a couple of worksheets. When students go out into the world, the lessons that we will need most will be those taught in the health classroom.&nbsp;</span></p>	33152
32082	If you’re left standing on the bus, don’t complain about it every day: do something	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At the start of a school year, there are a million things Blazers anticipate, likely including classes, teachers, the new one lunch, or homework. But for some it’s high capacity buses that are at the top of their list of things to worry about.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The term overcrowded gets thrown around a lot among students riding full buses. Yet, most of these buses are not overcrowded, they are simply at capacity. In the case that there is an overcrowded bus, there is usually a logical reason for the issue and some potential solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first reason is the overwhelming personal choice students have when picking the bus that they will be riding. Jammie Chessley, Assistant Senior Router and Magnet Coordinator of the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) Department of Transportation (DoT), explained that zoning to a specific bus stop has been removed making it difficult to estimate load counts. “Years ago, we used to assign students to the closest stops and we would send letters out, but the parents would call us and say ‘No, we want this stop’ or ‘we want the stop closest to the library.’ So now, we let them choose,” Chessley said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a result, the DoT does not know anything about overcrowding, until they receive feedback from drivers, schools, or parents. When Chessley receives such a notification, she takes a close look at the route to resolve the issues. “They will send me an email or call to say we’ve got an overload on this route, this school, and then I collect all the manifest for the particular school. And I will review them and make changes from there,” Chessley said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bus drivers provide load counts to the DoT in September and January. However, a variety of factors can make these counts inaccurate. Blazers could be going to a friend’s house, taking a sick day from school, riding home with their parents, or simply staying after school. For buses which are almost at capacity, these daily personal choices may fluctuate bus counts above maximum load capacity.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32081"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another consequence of students choosing their own buses is visible when there are two buses going to the same stops. 4994 and 4991, which both stop at Stone Mill Elementary School (SMES) and the Glen Club on Cavanaugh Drive, are prime examples of this issue. 4994 is the earlier bus, thus it is empty. On the other hand, the 10-minute-later departure of 4991 leaves it jam-packed. 4991 shoulders kids who want to sleep in or miss the bus, a number far greater than those who find it easy to leave their house 10 minutes earlier.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The same issue takes place in the afternoon. SMES is a designated stop on two buses, 5991 and 4991, due to the high population of students that live in that region. 5991 is overcrowded, while 4991 has plenty of seats left open. Once again, the reason is that 4991 reaches SMES 20 minutes later because of additional stops. Students want to get home as fast as possible and avoid any extension to the long ride.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mondays and Fridays (as well as school delays and early releases) are the most crowded days on the bus. This is due to yet another factor of student choice: activity buses. Blazers staying after school for extracurricular activities solve overcrowding because students are then sent home in two waves.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In certain&nbsp;cases, Blazer concerns are justified. Certain buses are crowded to the point that there may be some students standing. In this situation, complaining to your friends daily or boasting that you were the brave soul who stood during the bus ride will not change the situation. Instead, call the MCPS DoT; their jobs include helping with transportation issues and they are exceedingly supportive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Some are curious as to why the bus drivers do not resolve the issue of kids standing on the bus, but the answer is simple. When faced with two choices - kicking you off the bus or quietly allowing you to get home - drivers often pick the latter, which students no doubt appreciate.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Jennifer Ren talks about the struggle to find a seat on the bus. “When it’s straight-up way too crowded, the bus ride becomes unbearable and it’s almost like a really difficult roller coaster ride. With each turn you need to make sure that you don’t fall out of your seat,” Ren said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The new bus design exacerbates the issue of students having to brace themselves when sitting on the outsides of bus seats. The previous two-seater and three-seater have been replaced with what students have deemed “2.5 seaters.” The bus has an increased capacity, but seats are smaller for students - who are already bracing themselves with their hands and inner core strength - to sit comfortably in their seats.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, Ren also recognized that the problems within buses have to do with students. Musical instruments, jackets, and backpacks take up a handful of space. There are also always those kids who pretend to be asleep or just blatantly say no when you request to sit with them, just to avoid sharing a seat. This leads to buses which are not overcrowded to seem as though they are.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Buses are not meant to be a form of first-class travel. They serve a concrete purpose: transporting students to and from school. As long as there is a seat for every student, the bus serves the purpose. There are only so many resources in the county, so you getting your own seat is sadly not the priority. This, as well as getting a luxurious sleep or having the space to do homework, is simply not the intent.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yes some buses are crowded. Be that as it may, to say that they are overcrowded is usually a stretch. Pick up the phone and call the DoT if you feel your bus actually has an issue; if the concern is valid, change will come. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32081

33413	Blair Athletics, College Recruitment, and the Pandemic	<p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What challenges have the pandemic created for student athletes at Blair?</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A better question is: What challenges </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">hasn</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">'t it created for them? What about those athletes who are trying to get recruited by colleges, a process that was grueling enough before the pandemic hit? At Blair, athletes and coaches have done their best with what they have, which is to say, not much.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the most pressing challenges has been the cancellation of all MCPS-sponsored competitions. For time-based sports like running, fewer competitions means fewer chances to lower their times. For point-based sports like football, fewer games or combines means fewer chances to improve their stats and show scouts their athleticism.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yohannes Legesse, a senior on Blair's cross country and track teams, was only able to race once this fall at a non-MCPS track meet. He capitalized on this opportunity, running 5000m in 16 minutes and 36 seconds. This was a huge personal record, as he improved on his time from the previous season by over a minute.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cross country races were sparse this past fall due to COVID-19 restrictions, so Legesse counts himself lucky that he had an opportunity to compete. "I definitely felt like I could have done a lot better because I still had a lot left in me. If we had a season, it would have been really great. But it wasn't anything disappointing. I was just happy to get a race in. I thought it was impossible," Legesse says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For college recruitment, Legesse also reached out to a coach from a Division III school and began communicating in early December. "The key thing is just communication. [The coaches] want to know what experience you had… they want to know how the pandemic affected you specifically," Legesse says. Given that different athletes have faced their own unique sets of challenges, some coaches view each athlete's performances with more leniency because the pandemic has made it difficult to complete proper training.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With Blair's athletic facilities closed, students must either shell out money to join a club, buy a gym membership, or hire a personal trainer. For some, these options are not realistic due to financial or health concerns. Many students are stuck working out at home or outdoors with limited equipment. For a sport like football where the gym is essential to building strength and mass, losing access to a gym is a major setback.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Samuel Nosoff, head coach of Blair's football team, highlights the challenges that the pandemic has brought for his team. "One of the biggest things that football and a lot of the other sports are missing out on is we have athletes that rely heavily on the free gym that high school provides. Not all of our athletes are capable of paying for a gym membership or getting to a gym or doing some of the things that others may have the opportunity to," Nosoff says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33412"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">﻿</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A deepening divide</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The pandemic has deepened the divide between the students with the resources to pay for private training and those who rely on school facilities to train. "It's not because they're a worse athlete. It's not because they don't want to. It's just a simple matter of&nbsp;the dollar signs that come with the privatization," says Nosoff.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With in-person practices off the table, Nosoff and his team used the virtual football season to educate new athletes on the various plays that they had to learn anyways. Come Spring, they hope to have at least a combine, an event where students are evaluated on their athleticism and technical skill. "I hope that we have some sort of ability to host our own type of athletic combine for our athletes. If we're not able to play a football season, I'd like to see us be able to work with our athletes in small groups." This combine would allow athletes, not just football players, to test their abilities in a variety of drills, including the 40 yard dash, vertical jump, shuttle run, bench press, and broad jump.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the reasons that Nosoff wants to host a free combine for Blair athletes is that privately-run combines would have profit in mind over the safety of the athletes. Running a school-sponsored combine would ensure that coaches and athletes take the proper COVID-19 safety precautions. "I'd hate to see our kids having to shell out money and go to places that aren't MCPS to get things that typically are offered for free as a student athlete in a public school," Nosoff says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If a football season isn't possible in the spring, Nosoff wants Blair to host these athletic combines so that seniors can have something to show potential recruiters. For some of his athletes, college recruitment is their best shot at getting to college for the least amount of money possible. "We try to have conversations with each family and find out where everyone wants to be in terms of scholarships and academic money and anything that can help them attend a school where they can play football, get a degree. The ultimate goal is to pay as little money as possible to do so," Nosoff says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Athletes can make the process a little easier by reaching out to their coaches and Rita Boulé, Blair's Athletic Director, for assistance. "Reach out to me and their coach one hundred percent and then we go from there. That's what I love doing," Boulé says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Boulé and Blair's coaches will continue to support their athletes regardless of what MCPS sports look like during the second semester. The pandemic has thrown every imaginable curveball at them, but Blair's athletes and coaches have not wavered in their efforts to salvage what they can of their sports seasons.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As Nosoff sees it, the pandemic has tested the relationships between Blair athletes and their coaches. "In speaking with other coaches and other programs, across the board, I think our athletes did a really good job of staying with it and appreciating the virtual seasons. I think that's a testament to the coaches that we have at Blair and the programs that are being run at Blair and the relationships that have been built."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33412
33448	Brood X, composed of billions of periodical cicadas, has emerged in full force and will stay for about a month.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In most years, cicadas are just another insect that we see during the spring and summer. This year, however, the cicadas are a bit different -- they are periodical cicadas that belong to Brood X.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The cicadas we see in most years are annual cicadas that have a relatively shorter life cycle of one to two years. Periodical cicadas, which show up only once every other decade, are significantly different from the typical annual cicada; the most identifiable difference, </span><a href="https://www.wkrn.com/news/the-differences-between-periodical-and-annual-cicadas/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">according to wkrn.com</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, is that adult periodical cicadas have dark blue bodies and red eyes, while annual cicadas have black bodies and are larger in size.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Furthermore, the life cycle of periodical cycles lasts much longer than that of annual cicadas. The life cycle of a periodical cicada is about 17 years long, compared to the yearly-based cycle of annual cicadas. However, a periodical cicada spends almost all of its life underground, continuously growing and molting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Once the soil at the surface of the ground reaches a temperature of 64 degrees Fahrenheit, the cicada (which is called a “nymph” at this stage) finally emerges. The nymph then molts one more time and sheds its skin onto a vertical surface -- this is why you might see a bunch of brown, hollowed out cicada-shaped shells clinging to your neighborhood trees and electricity poles.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Once the nymph molts, it is now considered a full-fledged adult cicada. For the next few weeks, adult cicadas will mate, and each female cicada will then </span><a href="https://www.chicagobotanic.org/plantinfo/periodical_cicada_17_year#:~:text=The%20life%20cycle%20of%20cicadas,the%20longest%2Dlived%20insect%20known." target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">lay up to 600 eggs</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/why-are-cicadas-so-noisy#:~:text=Each%20male%20cicada%20has%20a,bend%2C%20producing%20a%20clicking%20sound." target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to the Encyclopedia Britannica</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, when male cicadas want to find female cicadas to mate with, they produce a loud clicking noise using their tymbal organs (an organ that is unique to cicadas). However, female cicadas usually only mate with one male in their lives. This means male cicadas will often try to compete with each other by producing the loudest noise. This is why, on a nice summer’s day, you might hear intense “chirping” and clicking noises coming from the treetops.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After two to four weeks of mating and laying eggs, the adult cicadas die. About a month later, the eggs will hatch and the nymphs will burrow themselves deep into the ground, where they will grow for another 17 years until the cycle starts again in 2038.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Generations” of periodical cicadas are referred to as broods. The current brood is Brood X, and the last brood that we saw was Brood IX in 2004. Brood X has billions of cicadas, and the reason there are so many of them is simple: strength in numbers. Even if predators eat a significant number of the cicada population, there’ll still be enough of them to continue mating and keep their species alive.</span></p><p><a href="http://sciencenetlinks.com/esheets/periodical-cicada-survival/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Cicadas are prey for all sorts of neighborhood animals</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, including birds, squirrels, and even dogs. Sophomore Christy Li notices that on their daily walks, her dog Lucky keeps trying to eat the hundreds of cicadas that cover the lawns and sidewalks. “He sticks his nose into the grass until something moves, and then chomps. I literally have to tell him off so many times when I walk him,” Li says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Brood X’s exceptionally large size is not the only thing making them unique -- </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2021/05/19/cicada-fungus-sex-drive/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">according to the Washington Post</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, there is also a new type of fungus that is circulating through the brood. On infected cicadas, the </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Massospora cicadina</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> fungus causes the bottom halves of their bodies to fall off gradually. In addition, the fungus causes the cicadas to try to mate as much as possible, even though they lack the organs necessary to reproduce without the bottom halves of their bodies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Infected cicadas may not have shorter lifespans, but their lives become “controlled” by the fungus. As they continue “mating” furiously, the fungus spreads quicker and quicker, and the fungi spores spread onto soil too. This means that when Brood XI emerges in 2038, even more of the nymphs will be infected by these spores.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As of right now, the fungus doesn’t seem to have made a lasting indent on the population size of Brood X, just because of the sheer number of cicadas. However, scientists still aren’t sure if Brood XI will be different, so we’ll have to wait until 2038 to see. Until then, let’s do our best to enjoy the cicadas… or just plug our ears until they stop chirping during the night. </span></p>	33447
33369	Sankofa's first episode is finally here, and it was definitely worth the wait.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Finally, our pining is over: </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZtUkE91SuRA4Ei-YwRLtzmz1Zc3JeRce/view" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">"The History of Minstrelsy,"</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> the first episode of </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qQfnRKL53gX2QazYxtPV1ZhHnGVcgVrFX61bzzom1oQ/edit" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Sankofa 2021</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, is here. Directed, written and narrated by junior Ingrid Ellis, the episode takes a piercing look at blackface and its legacy in today's entertainment industry. Seniors Kasey Thorpe and Charles Thrush weave the narration, poetry, music, and visuals together with outstanding editing that makes the episode soar. The poetry and music from senior Amina King, junior Samar Haddad, senior Abonie Blount and senior Che Moorhead elevates the episode from history to searing, soulful art.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In line with this year's theme of Black experiences in television and film, "The History of Minstrelsy," is less about the White people in blackface, instead shining a spotlight on the resilience of Black entertainers who had to endure the humiliation of stereotypes and caricatures and how they took advantage of these stereotypes to jumpstart their careers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although the MCPS curriculum skims over minstrelsy, it is imperative that White students understand that blackface is another way that America has tried to control Black bodies—this time to entertain White audiences. Sankofa is picking up the slack the MCPS leaves in its lessons on American history.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The episode is far more than just history; it overflows with emotion, oscillating from hope to melancholy and back again. King's performance of "</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/20/amanda-gormans-inaugural-poem-the-hill-we-climb-full-text.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">The Hill We Climb</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">" by inaugural poet Amanda Gorman urges Americans to strive for a better future.

32241	The event was a unique opportunity to meet impactful female scientists and engineers	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MBHS Code Girls hosted its first Women in STEM seminar in the Blair auditorium on Oct. 24 at 2:30 p.m. Speakers Dr. Barbara Nichols, Major Natalie Collins, Karrin Felton, Dr. Yaireska Collado-Vega, Monica Chu, Shalise Alison and Kayla Huffman discussed the paths to their current STEM careers in hopes of inspiring female students to find their passions in science.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Code Girls, led by senior Shreeya Khurana, meets weekly to immerse students in coding and web development projects. Under the National Center for Women and Information Technology (</span><a href="https://www.ncwit.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">NCWIT</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">), Khurana partnered with Karen Harper from Building Engineering and Science Talent (</span><a href="https://www.bestworkforce.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">BEST</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">) to reach out to local women in STEM fields. "I've always seen a lack of females in STEM, especially computer science," Khurana said. "Thankfully, Code Girls was able to connect me to Karen and these amazing women."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Dr. Barbara Nichols, a materials research scientist at the U.S. Army Research Lab, described the early influences that directed her toward STEM. Nichols referred to Michael Jackson's 1982 hit, Billie Jean— specifically the piano keys that lit up beneath his feet as he moved in the music video. "I didn't really care about Billie Jean, or her lover, but I wanted to know how they did that," she said. "I think that was the first thing that really got me into electronics and sensing." Nichols took advantage of the opportunities at her school, seeking out engineering opportunities for minority students and utilizing her programming skills. She went on to major in Materials Science, obtaining her B.S. from MIT and her Ph.D. from Northwestern University.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although neither of her parents went to college, Major Natalie Collins found a place at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR). Collins was fascinated by the 1995 movie </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Outbreak</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. She loved the idea of tracking down an infectious disease and saving others, but she didn't appreciate that the heroine became infected and was saved by men. "I felt like my job in life was to rectify this wrong," Collins said. "We could easily have the female find the non-human primate, developing the vaccine, administering the vaccine, instead of being saved."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Collins set her mind on epidemiology, serving as an intern in research labs and a combat medic in the military. Now the Chief of Diagnostics at WRAIR, she cited the army as a useful tool in shaping her career, paying for both her B.S. and Ph.D. and building the spirit of constant growth.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Marine Corps Engineering Competency Manager and Federal STEM Action Officer Karrin Felton pointed to basketball and piano, which helped her develop focus and curiosity. She emphasized the importance of surrounding oneself with positive influences. As a high school student, Felton met every morning with her "breakfast club," a group of friends constantly reminding each other of their goals. "Be careful of who you choose to be your friend, because they will influence you whether you want them to or not," she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Dr. Yaireska Collado-Vega currently leads the space weather forecasting team at NASA. Her journey from a low-income family in Puerto Rico spells the hard work behind this title. She fell in love with NASA early on, despite the lack of support from her community. Although she had to leave her family in Puerto Rico to pursue her dream, Collado-Vega realized that the words of others couldn't shake her goals. "A lot of people told me I couldn't be a scientist because of the way I look," she said. "I said, 'I don't care. I'm never going to change the way I look.'"</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Monica Chu, a post-baccalaureate research fellow with the US Army Research Lab, also had no clear path for the future as a student. "I didn't know what I wanted to do, and that's okay," she said. "I put four types of engineering on pieces of paper and I picked out bioengineering." Chu switched between many labs while discovering her true interests, and said the changes had positive effects. "It helped me to be adaptive," she said. "I had to learn a lot of jobs, and I learned to ask a lot of questions.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32240"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Shalise Alison said she had a rough road as a woman in STEM. Alison immigrated to the U.S. from Jamaica, had to take English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes and was bullied by students. She was accepted to Morgan State University but opted to go to trade school for child care instead. Later, Alison was again deterred from attending university when she became pregnant at age 21. She eventually obtained her B.S. in biology at Morgan as a single mom, making it clear that there was no end of the road. "I'm getting my master's in teaching right now, but I will be a biologist one day," she said. "A difficult road often leads to a beautiful destination."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Growing up in a family of female nurses, Kayla Huffman was always accustomed to helping others. "I was known as the girl who carried a med kit no matter where I went," she said. "When other kids got injured on the playground, I was there before the school nurse was." She noted that taking the time to discover specific STEM fields and finding a suitable college environment as key aspects of finding one's passion in science. She is now working toward her B.S. in biology at Morgan State University.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Felton pointed to </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hidden Figures</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a true story of three brilliant African-American women at NASA who powered the launch of astronaut John Glenn, as an indicator of the importance of women in STEM. "In the back of that movie theater, I was in awe to say that I shared something with those women," she said. "I remember the trail that they blazed for somebody like me."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students gathered for a reception and question-and-answer session at the end of the seminar. Attendees appreciated the representation of diversity in STEM fields. "I liked that the presenters were people of color," junior Saron Kebekab said. "Seeing their journeys into the STEM field gave me a chance to see future opportunities of my own."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Khurana wants to keep connecting girls to role models in the future. "I wanted the girls to see female leaders in STEM and envision themselves in these careers," she said. "Hopefully, in college, I'll be able to plan these events for high schoolers and middle schoolers."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32240

32880	The National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL) each approved plans to resume play later this summer	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On May 26, the National Hockey League (NHL) approved plans to resume play later this summer in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;On June 4, the National Basketball Association (NBA) followed suit.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32879"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For the NBA, 29 of the 30 team representatives voted in favor of a plan that will send 22 teams to the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Florida to finish the season that was suspended on March 11. The season is expected to resume on July 30 with the NBA Finals ending no later than October 12. Teams are expected to arrive in the Orlando area between July 9 and 11 to begin training.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Under this plan, each team will play 8 games to determine seeding for the playoffs. Seven teams in each conference have already clinched a playoff spot. In the Eastern Conference, those teams are the Bucks, Raptors, Celtics, Heat, Pacers, 76ers and the Nets. In the Western Conference, the Lakers, Clippers, Nuggets, Jazz, Thunder, Rockets and Mavericks have also already claimed a playoff spot. The Spurs, Kings, Pelicans, Suns, Trailblazers, Grizzlies and Wizards each have a chance to claim the eighth spot in their respective conferences.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the plan’s approved format, each team is expected to have one day where they play back-to-back games. According to </span><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29267294/source-nba-approves-plan-return-orlando" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">ESPN</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, there will be a four hour break between every game in order to decrease the chances of someone contracting coronavirus. The playoff format will stay the same as it was originally planned.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The NBA’s plan features a campus-style environment in order to limit contact with others as much as possible. All games will be played in the same facility, which has three separate courts, with no fans allowed. Teams will stay at Disney’s resorts nearby, with families allowed to accompany them. The idea behind this environment is to keep teams as isolated from the outside as possible to reduce the chances of someone getting infected. All will be required to follow strict social distancing protocol. </span><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29267294/source-nba-approves-plan-return-orlando" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">ESPN</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> has also reported that players and team personnel will be tested daily for COVID-19. If a player or coach tests positive, he will be required to sit out while the rest of the team continues to play.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rising senior Brian Mccaw believes it is a good thing that the games will continue. “I think it’s a great idea. It’ll finally give people something to watch and cheer for while stuck at home,” Mccaw said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rising senior William Fitzgerald echoes Mccaw and other fans of the game. “I am ecstatic.

32923	Both conferences voted to suspend their seasons due to COVID-19	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of America’s favorite fall pastimes will not be taking place at many universities across the midwest and the west coast this year. The Big Ten Conference and the Pacific Athletic Conference (PAC-12), both members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), decided to cancel their respective football seasons on August 11 due to COVID-19.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32922"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For the Big Ten, representatives from all 14 schools voted 12-2 in favor of suspending the season, making it the first major college athletic conference to do so. The decision to axe the season was fueled by worries about athletes’ health. “It became abundantly clear that there was too much uncertainty regarding potential medical risks to allow our student-athletes to compete this fall,” stated Big Ten commissioner </span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/big-ten-cancels-college-football-season-for-fall-2020-hopes-to-play-in-spring-2021/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Kevin Warren</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. However, Warren implied his conference would try again in the spring. “We aren’t giving up forever,” he stated.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Big Ten also </span><a href="https://bigten.org/news/2020/8/11/general-big-ten-statement-on-2020-21-fall-season.aspx" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">released a statement</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> explaining that “multiple factors” lead to the cancellation of the season besides the health risk, including the mental health and general wellbeing of the student-athletes. Advice from local government officials was also an important factor in the decision-making process.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Players and coaches alike were disappointed with the cancellation. Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields </span><a href="https://twitter.com/justnfields/status/1293272660999385094?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1293272660999385094%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.saturdaydownsouth.com%2Fcollege-football%2Fbig-ten-cancel-justin-fields-ohio-state-buckeyes-reaction-smh%2F" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">tweeted</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> “smh” shortly after the decision was announced.

All PAC-12 schools unanimously voted in favor of postponing the season until the spring, according to </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sports Illustrated</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RossDellenger/status/1293277711465697286" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Ross Dellenger</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The season was postponed due to advice from medical officials and general uncertainty about the course of the pandemic. Prior to the finalization of the decision to cancel, school athletic directors were also briefed on myocarditis, a deadly heart condition linked to COVID-19 in young people.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sports pundits and Blazers alike were disappointed about these decisions. Chad Dukes, a radio host on Washington D.C.’s sports radio station </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">106.7 The Fan</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> expressed his disappointment that there would be no PAC-12 or Big Ten football this year, saying he wished the season could have been played. Junior Chris Lafleur&nbsp;had similar sentiments, but believed it was necessary. “I was kind of disappointed...but it was a good idea because you don’t want to see anyone get sick or even die,” Lafleur said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the outcry of disappointment, Blair senior Axel Rives believes cancelling the season was for the best. “They needed to do it because it was for the safety of the players and coaches,” Rives said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The long-term effects of the pandemic on college athletics are yet to be seen. For months, there had been a growing sentiment that college sports would be heavily affected by the pandemic. More conferences are likely to cancel their fall sports seasons, something unprecedented for the NCAA.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The effects of cancelling the college football season for these conferences is likely to cause damage to the athletic programs of the schools. Athletic programs will not receive the revenue from ticket sales or TV deal payouts. According to </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2020/07/21/fall-without-football-would-have-long-term-financial-implications/5471792002/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>USA Today</em></a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, over 60% of many athletic departments’ combined total annual operating revenue comes from football. The significant lack of revenue will add to the lengthy list of problems most universities are experiencing because of COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The effects will also do harm to the local economies of college towns. Fans will not be there to spend money, which normally generates a major amount of revenue for the many bars and restaurants around towns.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The overall impact on college towns and schools due to the cancellation of the football season is unlikely to be pretty. Both parties will have substantial losses of revenue. The futures of many potential NFL athletes are now uncertain, and the financial impact on the athletic boards at colleges is unlikely to make those futures any less murky.&nbsp;</span></p>	32922
31781	The complexities of having a tiger parent	<p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Editors Note: Where only first names appear, names have been changed to protect the identity of the sources. </em></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"Did you do this? How are your grades doing? Why'd you get a B on this assignment?" </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sarah, a junior, hears those phrases every day without fail. Her peers may hear the same words from a teacher or mentor, but for Sarah, they come from someone much closer —&nbsp;her dad. She is one of many teens around the world who has a "tiger parent," someone who watches over their child intensely. Considering tiger parent horror stories in books and movies, Sarah's situation may seem unfortunate. Contrary to popular opinion, though, tiger parents aren't entirely terrible. According to their own children, the realities of living with a harsh parent are both good and bad.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sarah's dynamic with her father centers around his "constant nagging," typical of many tiger parents. All the conversations she has with him are focused on school. "He expects me to perform my best and work as hard as I can on everything… I've literally never talked about anything other than something academic with him," she says. This type of parent-child relationship </span><a href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/cons-of-pressuring-kids-to-get-good-grades-4117600" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">increases</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> the risk of unhealthy stress, putting Sarah and many others at a partial disadvantage.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Luke, another junior, faces a similar situation where his parents push him to get perfect grades and excel in everything he does. "[They] </span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">always tell me that… you can always do better than a B. [They say] I have to take really high-level classes and I have to get really high test scores and that I just have to perform at a high level," he explains. "My parents have always told me that you should not just try your best but </span><em style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">be</em><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;"> the best in everything you do."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">The term "tiger mom" was coined by </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Amy Chua in her </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/tiger-mom-amy-chua-controversial-book-parenting-guide/story?id=12767305" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">controversial novel</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, where she praised intimidating Chinese moms like herself. Naturally, the concept has a cultural factor to it. Such is the case for Sarah, whose family is from India. She notices a difference between the way her father and others' parents approach discipline. "I have my Asian friends and they all feel the same way as me, and then with my non-Asian friends… there's a little bit more freedom," she describes.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31757"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For Luke, whose mom is Japanese, tiger parenting doesn't come only from a traditional cultural background, but from family history. His grandparents were tiger parents and made his mom study for "hours on end" during her childhood, pushing her to go to college and immigrate to the U.S. even though they didn't have much money. "</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">It's been drilled into her from childhood — she went to piano lessons after school, she went to all sorts of different extracurriculars all to make sure that she could be the best student in her small town," he says of his mom. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Considering their longtime exposure to tiger parenting, both Sarah and Luke see advantages to it. Although Sarah admits that her father's pressure is sometimes "a bit much" on top of the stress she faces from school, she views it as a useful reminder to get her work done. "You've got so much on your mind that having a little push sometimes is necessary just to keep you on top of your stuff," she explains. "I feel like having that extra pressure is just good for keeping me on track." </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Luke finds the pressure more than just helpful, and praises his parents for bringing out the best in him. </span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">"</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">My family has drilled it into me that I am smart and I deserve opportunities and that I have to do everything I can to get those opportunities…" he says. "</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">In some ways it's admirable that parents care so much about their child's education that they are willing to do anything and sacrifice anything for that child and their betterment." </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">Many think that tiger parents deter teenagers from following their own path. It's true that parental pressure can sometimes lower a child's confidence to follow their personal dreams, but Luke's experience has been the opposite. The majority of his passions —&nbsp;multiple clubs involving public speaking and politics, where he's been successful—&nbsp;are self-motivated. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">"My mom told me that no matter what… she only wanted me to care about what I was doing and be the best at what I was doing. She didn't want to choose my life for me," Luke says. "I don't think any of [my] goals were dictated by my parents. All of them have risen out of my passions and what I've come to love during my time in high school."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sarah's biggest goal, attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for college, has become less appealing as she has gotten older because of the pressure she faces from her dad to reach it. "It's always that constant push of 'If you want to go to MIT, you've got to do this,'" Sarah explains. "Now I'm just like, 'UMD seems good too!'" </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, at the same time, Sarah realizes that her father is just encouraging her to pursue what she wants and that his desires are in line with hers. "His dreams are for me to achieve my dreams and the thing is that I set really high dreams for myself," she explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Luke and Sarah are joined by a host of other students around the country — about </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/09/tiger-parenting" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">30%</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> — who have found their tiger parents' pressure to be helpful, as chronicled by a </span><a href="https://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/may/asian-european-moms-052014.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Stanford study</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Unfortunately, not all people feel the same way. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some are traumatized by the unrealistic expectations their parents place on them. Aaminah Khan, a writer who grew up with a tiger parent, now </span><a href="https://humanparts.medium.com/i-grew-up-with-a-tiger-parent-and-all-i-got-was-this-lousy-psychological-trauma-1c260eb138f4?gi=87433e03f0e" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">speaks out</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> against the "affection-withholding" behavior of her father. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It is [not] worth emulating to hold one’s children to impossible standards and then to make them suffer… when they fail to reach the bar," Khan emphasizes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Luke agrees with that sentiment. "</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">I think in some cases [tiger parenting]... is a form of psychological abuse," he acknowledges. Sarah encourages those who face the same kind of negative tiger parenting and emotional abuse as Khan to stand up for themselves. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If your parents are pressuring you for something you don't want to do at all, make it clear to them that that's not where you want to go," she advises. While advocating for oneself can be difficult, she says, it takes a weight off a person's shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sarah and Luke find themselves in a complex narrative. While they have positive stories of tiger parenting, some of their peers do not. Sarah "understands that [her dad] is doing what is best for her." On the other hand, other teens with similar goals know that their parents' intensity is definitely detrimental to them. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There's no definitive answer to whether "tiger parents" are helpful or not, because the term has existed for eight years and has been evolving since. Decades of contrasting stories reveal that it's up to each student to determine how they feel about their tiger parent. Positive or negative, however, resilience exists — at the end of the day, Sarah, Luke, and other teens have learned to reflect and take the good with the bad. "There's always the frustration when a conversation happens that [isn't] pleasant," Sarah says. "But after a while, I just get back [up] and keep going."</span></p>	31757

Throughout the evening, the Blazers fought strong, whether pinning their opponents early on or resisting a hold until the very end.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Brian McCaw earned three team points in the first match, but the Blazers fell under 6-3 due to a forfeit in the second match. In the 126-pound weight class, senior Aidan Rogers began closing the point gap. After struggling against his opponent for nearly three periods, Rogers managed to turn the tables in the final moments. "I was losing for 95 percent of the match and at the end I was down four to nothing," Rogers said. "I got a reverse cradle and turned him onto his back and got five points in the last second."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32444"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Nikolai Tochilin pinned his opponent within the first two minutes, quickly earning six team points and placing the Blazers in the lead 12-9. Senior Nimesh Fonseka wrestled in the 138-pound weight class. Despite a tough fight in the first two periods, Fonseka pinned his opponent in the third period, with the Blazers now leading 18-9.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the 145-pound weight class, sophomore Junior Kim pinned his opponent in under two minutes as well, giving the team another six-point boost. "I tried a pinning combination move in the first period but slipped and almost got pinned, which would have been terrible because he was not better than me," Kim said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Luke Merill and senior Jason Kaplan persisted through their matches, but Broadneck began closing the closing the point gap. However, Broadneck forfeited the 170-pound match, bringing Blair back up 30-17.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Izu Nweke pinned his opponent in the third period as well, increasing Blair's lead. "I started off easy to preserve energy, studying his weaknesses to see what I could do," Nweke said. "I just kept on building up points in the second period— then I saw the opening in the third period and I pinned him for the win."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Kemith Sturdavent wrestled for the first time on varsity at this match in the 285-pound weight class, giving team captains and seniors Elias Chen and Mervin Mancia the opportunities to wrestle in their home weight class instead of those up to 100 pounds more— in order to place a wrestler in each match. "He was scared and I knew he was backing out." Mancia said. "Wrestling 220 felt like home."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chen noted that today's match was representative of the Blazers' spirit. "Starting out, we were a little bit sluggish, but once we kicked it into gear, we looked sharp," Chen said. "We got a lot of third period pins, and I think that's the team we're becoming— we wrestle hard, and even if the other guys are better, we're tougher."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chen also felt confident about tonight's win and what it means for the wrestling team's future. "This is the kind of match that I could see us getting lazy or sloppy in previous years, but today we really pushed and sealed the deal," he said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair boys' varsity wrestling will play their next home match on Wednesday, Jan. 8 against Clarksburg at 6:15 p.m.</em></p>	32444

Johnson wrote.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A celebration for 47 of the semi-finalists was held in the courtyard outside the counseling office at 7:45 a.m. on Friday, Sept. 17. Senior Sally Kaye was both surprised and excited to receive her results. "I was excited because the chance of getting a scholarship is really exciting and recognition is nice," Kaye said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Celeste Basken, one of the National Merit semi-finalists, applied via alternate entry with her SAT score. Though she was also surprised when she received her results, she doesn't believe that such a high emphasis should be placed on test scores. "I feel like the SAT is not really a great measure of academic success or people's intelligence… I mean, for some people, it definitely means a lot and I totally support them for that. I just think it's important for the administration to emphasize things besides just test scores and things that are not necessarily equitably administered," Basken said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Getting to a testing site, having time to study or even sending SAT scores from College Board to NMSC could be obstacles for students.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kaye furthermore attested to a lack of widespread information that could have prevented more non-program Blazers from earning the title of semi-finalist, as only two of the 51 students were not in the CAP or Magnet Programs. "Everyone should have equal access to information on how to do these things because a lot of people aren't getting the recognition they deserve," Kaye said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Basken echoed this idea, pointing out that many students didn't realize how the process worked. "I think I know a lot of people who probably have good test scores and said that they didn't know that they were allowed to use their SAT score, or they didn't know how the whole process worked, " Basken said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The National Merit Scholarship semi-finalists were determined based on PSAT/NMSQT scores from junior year or on an alternative entry.

33060	Blair seniors analyze wins and losses of their ORACLE Presidential election forecast model	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Saturday, Nov. 7, Joe Biden became the 46th President-Elect after a nail-biting few days. In the wake of the 2020 Presidential Election results, political observers and professional election predictors alike are now comparing which election forecast model most accurately predicted Biden’s win percentage. Blair’s Political Statistics class, led by teacher David Stein, is no different.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33059"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Starting in September, seniors in Political Statistics created a Presidential election model, named the </span><a href="https://polistat.mbhs.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Overall Results of an Analytical Consideration of the Looming Elections (ORACLE) of Blair. </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;The ORACLE predicts the statewide and national win percentage of both candidates, and the model is complete with interactive maps, timeseries’, electoral vote distributions and blog posts written by students analyzing specific outcomes and trends. With the conclusion of the 2020 Presidential Election, students are now learning statistics metrics to compare how well the ORACLE did in its predictions compared to professional models created by </span><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">538</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">TheEconomist</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Election has been a historical election, with many notable election moments like </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/10/30/texas-votes-cast/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Texas surpassing 2016 vote numbers despite the pandemic.</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Despite accurately predicting Joe Biden’s national win, students who worked on the ORACLE model note many major flaws with their model, the biggest one being polling data.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/us/politics/election-polls-trump-biden.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to the New York Times</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, election polls in 2016 infamously hugely under predicted Trump’s win in key states as well as nationwide. And with most votes counted and accounted for, it seems as if the polls missed the mark again this 2020 election cycle, albeit not as blatantly as in 2016. The ORACLE incorrectly predicted that Biden would turn sunbelt states such as Florida and North Carolina, and in the historically red states that Biden did win, like Michigan and Wisconsin, the vote percentage for Trump was significantly higher than predicted.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Carlos Hernandez, who worked on poll weighting and theoretical aspects of the ORACLE model, states </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">that the polls were the deciding factor in such an inaccurate picture of the election. “The polls were really, really, really off, and it's hard to make a good model with garbage data," Hernandez comments. "Polling inaccuracy is something that our model did account for, but we concluded that a massive polling error would be needed to give Trump a shot at winning, and that was what we ended up getting." Hernandez explains that most good models do keep inaccurate polls in mind, and that the ORACLE model handled this polling error as reasonably as could be expected.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">Polling error hinges on a multitude of factors including incorrectly predicting that all Latinx voters would lean Democratic, when in reality, Cuban and Venezulan voters vote differently than immigrants from Mexico and Central America. “I think it's definitely related to the country of origin. I was born in Venezuela, and I wasn't surprised that many bought into the anti-socialist narrative Trump was pushing. Georgia was a major surprise for me. When I saw the situation in NC and FL on election night I thought for sure it was going red,” Hernandez continues.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">Polls also didn't account for the Trump voters who are uncomfortable publicly supporting him, and misrepresented demographics that swing heavily for Trump.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">Despite polling inaccuracies underpredicting Trump’s vote count, the biggest win for seniors working on the ORACLE was the opportunity to put together a professional-like forecast model in less than one month. Senior Kevin Higgs says that for a high school team, he is very proud of the work that the Political Statistics class was able to put together. “I wanted to join Political Statistics because I'm always intrigued by these real world sorts of projects. I was excited by the prospect and it lived up to my expectations,” Higgs says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Creating an election forecast model required tremendous work on many fronts to not only create an election model but also develop a website and design the graphics. “I was most involved in developing and hosting the website. I pulled an all nighter the night before it went live because I had to implement a ton of features and incorporate everyone's feedback,” Higgs concludes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The ORACLE of Blair model saw major wins and losses this election cycle, but the seniors hope their model will increase awareness for the Political Statistics class as well as encourage other high school students to take on similar projects. The ORACLE has been retweeted by Rep. Jamie Raskin and Founder of Center for Politics, Larry Sabato.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To see how the ORACLE of Blair did in 2018 races, read our article </em><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/political-statistics-class-creates-a-midterm-election-model-31387/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>here</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. </em></p>	33059
32362	The soul food chain opens up new location in Briggs Chaney	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery County is getting its first Hip Hop Fish and Chicken restaurant at the Briggs Chaney Center. There are 24 other locations located in Md., and one other location in Washington, D.C. They serve fried fish and chicken entrees, soul food sides and desserts.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I'm not completely sure why it's called "Hip Hop" Fish and Chicken, there was no music in the restaurant, and the vibe was pretty dull. Keep in mind, though, that it's a new place, and they may still need to set a few things up. The menus are red and yellow, though, so their color scheme is bright.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32358"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Fish and Chicken Combo gives you a choice of any two fish or chicken entrees with fries, coleslaw and bread for $11. There is a special with two side choice, where you can choose from certain entrees and get two sides for $11.50.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">They also offer fish by the piece and chicken by the piece. Sweet potato pie, banana pudding and bean pie highlight their dessert options, which are inexpensive. They offer classic American sides like fries, onion rings, hush puppies, sweet potatoes, garden salad and more. Their appetizer section is in fact appetizing, with fried meatballs, fried pickles, jalapeno poppers, macaroni and cheese bites and more. The entrees generally fall in the price range of eight to $12, while the sides are about $3 to $5, the appetizers are about $1 to $7 and desserts are $1 to $4.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I was able to get the Fish and Chicken combo (with shrimp and catfish fillet), the special with two sides (six buffalo wings, macaroni and cheese and collard greens) and peach cobbler for just north of $25. Considering what I paid, the quality of food and the amount of food was great value. They definitely gave me a bang for my buck.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I got my food in no more than 15 minutes, and they did well with keeping the line to order moving. All the food I had was delicious, although a bit salty, was very good. It was made to order and flavorful. The peach cobbler was prepackaged (from another company), but it was very good.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The restaurant serves carryout only, and they accept both walk-in orders and phone orders. Note if you're vegetarian or want a healthy meal, do not come here, all they will have for you is green beans, coleslaw and a garden salad. If you want some quality comfort food that feels like home, this is the place for you.</span></p><p><a href="http://hiphopfc.com" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Hip Hop Fish and Chicken</a></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Address: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">13820 Old Columbia Pike, Silver Spring, MD 20904</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hours:</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Sunday-Thursday: 10 a.m. - 10 p.m., Friday-Saturday: 10 a.m. - 11 p.m.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Phone: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">(301) 879-5656</span></p>	32358

32933	The county stopped working with COVID-19 testing lab Advagenix due to questions of reliability	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On August 13, Montgomery County temporarily closed down four COVID-19 testing sites around the county, with plans to soon close them all. One day later, on August 14, Advagenix was ordered to stop providing COVID-19 tests because of </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“improper laboratory and COVID-19 testing procedures that endanger patient health, safety, and welfare,” according to the </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/coronavirus/county-opens-two-covid-19-test-sites-unsure-why-state-issued-order-against-rockville-lab/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Bethesda Beat</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. These concerns included questions over the safety of saliva samples, especially regarding transport in extreme temperatures. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although Advagenix only supplied about 8 percent of more than 251,100 tests over the last two months, it supplied over 88 percent of the tests that the county gave out at free testing locations, giving this recall the potential to close free testing locations for a decent amount of time.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nearly a week later, on August 18, Montgomery County officially suspended the contract with Advagenix in a statement released by the county.&nbsp;However, there has been contention over whether this permit suspension was supposed to happen, with Advagenix officials of the opinion that testing should continue. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On August 20, </span><a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org/advagenix-state-health-department-incorrectly-said-permit-was-suspended/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Montgomery County Media</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> reported that Advagenix CEO and Chief Scientific Officer Dr. William Kearns expressed that the suspension of Advagenix tests was incorrect and caused consequences for the company. “As a result of the error, the county paused testing at its clinics where residents could receive free testing. The error also caused confusion to the public, calling into question test results for more than 17,000 residents,” Kearns said. This situation has not yet been resolved, with questions still remaining on the reason for the order and the payment given to Advagenix. Meanwhile, a few free testing locations have opened back up.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since the beginning of the pandemic, county officials have set up free testing locations around the county in order to contain the spread of COVID-19. According to the </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20different%20types,an%20active%20coronavirus%20infection." target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">FDA</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, there are two main types of testing, diagnostic tests and antibody tests. Diagnostic tests are done through throat or nasal swabs, and show whether the person currently has COVID-19. Antibody tests are done through blood tests, and show whether a person has ever had COVID-19 in the past, and is used to determine if the person might have been an asymptomatic carrier. Advagenix is used for diagnostic testing, and this has affected the county’s ability to screen for cases.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32932"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although Advagenix only supplied about 8 percent of COVID-19 tests countywide, it supplied more than 88 percent of the free county-distributed tests coming from Advagenix, according to the </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/coronavirus/county-terminates-covid-19-testing-contract-with-advagenix/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Bethesda Beat</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. The recall of COVID tests make it much harder for people to get COVID-19 testing, as the only way to get the tests currently is by going through businesses and getting personal tests. This problem could be solved relatively soon, however, because Advagenix is working to figure out what went wrong, if anything.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org/excessive-heat-did-not-harm-covid-19-test-specimens-advagenix-study-finds/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery Community Media </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">reported that in a study conducted by Advagenix, it was found that all of their saliva samples were shipped in safe and secure situations, and that the rise in temperature did not affect any of them. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Our preanalytical temperature stability study demonstrates that no saliva sample was compromised by excessive heat,” Kearns said. Although no resolution has yet been reached, both county and company officials are working to continue to help measure and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Montgomery County.</span></p>	32932
33012	Despite the pandemic cancelling most in-person gatherings, there are still many ways to celebrate	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As Halloween draws closer, many are upset that because of COVID-19, trick-or-treating will not be a possibility. In fact, guidelines from the Montgomery County council </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/covid19/reopening/requirements/halloween.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">strongly discourage trick-or-treating</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, or any event where food is distributed. This means no in-person parties, no trick-or-treating, and no movie nights on the same couch as your friends. However, this doesn’t mean that Halloween is cancelled, or that there are no ways to enjoy the holiday. Here are a few suggestions:</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Have an online party</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Just because people can’t meet in person doesn’t mean that a party can’t happen! Zoom parties are a great way to stay in touch with your friends, and can even be easier than in-person parties which require considerable planning and effort. All you need to do is find a time where everyone is free, get some candy, and pull on a costume. Set up a costume competition, or just hang out with some good friends. The possibilities are endless, only inhibited by whether Zoom decides to stop working.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Put up decorations</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33011"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even though trick-or-treaters won’t be seeing your decorations, plenty of other people will! Putting up decorations can help your house look the part, and as an added bonus, is incredibly fun to do! Plan a competition with friends or neighbors where the&nbsp;best-looking house wins a prize. Fancy decorations aren’t needed, as there are many homemade decorations that can be made with simple materials. Some examples are paper chains of pumpkins or ghosts, wreaths made of branches, or paper silhouettes placed in windows. These ideas, as well as many more, can be found </span><a href="https://www.countryliving.com/diy-crafts/how-to/g1024/do-it-yourself-halloween-decorations-1010/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, with instructions. Have fun decorating!</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Watch a good movie</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For people who aren’t the biggest fan of scary movies, but want to get in the Halloween spirit, there are tons of classics to choose from. A great choice is anything by Tim Burton, including </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Nightmare Before Christmas </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(Disney Plus) and </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Corpse Bride</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> (Amazon Prime, can be rented for about 4 dollars), which are some of my personal favorites.

The thin wafer-like cookie is rolled into a cone, stuffed with chocolate or sweets and is usually cooked in a two-sided iron griddle. As pretty as it is delicious, Krumkake is a delicate, crunchy cookie. Satrom says her family usually fills krumkake with cinnamon or berries and whipped cream, “I have a really super old family recipe for krumkake. Our family actually has our great grandmother’s original iron griddle press for making the krumkake cookie. It even has old Norwegian writing inscribed in it,” Satrom says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although this online recipe is not Satrom’s timeless family recipe, here is how to make Krumkake:</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Krumkake Ingredients:</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1/2 cup unsalted butter</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1 cup white sugar</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2 eggs</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1 cup milk&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1/2 teaspoon butter flavoring, optional</span></p><p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/68293/norwegian-krumkake/print/?recipeType=Recipe&amp;servings=50&amp;isMetric=false" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">See full directions and recipe here.&nbsp;</a></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Corn Pie</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32416"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are many takes on corn pie, from Amish and Dutch to Trinidadian recipes.

32341	The Alumni Association inducts eight new trailblazers and highlights their successful lives	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Starting in 2009, the Blair Alumni Association has recognized graduates who are influential and successful outside the classroom. On </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/alumni-hall-lives-up-to-its-name-32264/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Nov. 2</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">,&nbsp;eight new members joined the Alumni Association Hall of Fame: Steve Barber, a professional baseball player;&nbsp;Malcolm "Mac" Beasley, a professor and prominent physicist; Carol Mehrling, the first female police chief of Montgomery County; Eliot Pfanstiehl, a music icon; Brian Magid, a Blair sports star; Jacque Crenca Hinman, CEO of Fortune 500 company CH2M Hill; Carlos "Chick" Hernandez, a local sportscaster; and Craig Rice, a member of the Montgomery County Council.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Steve Barber ('56)</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a student at Blair, Steve Barber already stood out among his fellow student athletes. Before the world saw him wearing an Orioles jersey on the pitcher’s mound, Barber blazed through high school baseball at Blair. Old friend and former teammate Buddy Kreh ('56) reminisces about Barber's goals for high school and beyond, “His aspirations were always to be a ball player. [Growing up,] Steve wanted to play for the American Legion team [as a high schooler], which in the summertime was actually the Blair High School team playing under the American Legion banner.” Soon after graduating from Blair, Barber signed with the Baltimore Orioles, where he would spend the next seven years playing baseball.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Barber’s two-time All-Star baseball career came to a close in 1974, but he still had much to show regarding his excitement to serve society. A hero at heart, in the last couple decades, Barber has been driving buses for children with disabilities.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Malcolm “Mac” Beasley ('57)</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mac Beasley graduated from Blair in 1957 and went on to study physics at Cornell University. After earning a Ph.D. in engineering physics at Cornell, Beasley accepted faculty positions at Harvard University and subsequently at Stanford University, where he eventually became the Dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32343"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Beasley’s early Blair life was hardly academically centered. He was involved in many extracurriculars such as student council, drama, Masque and Gavel and Library Club. But basketball was Beasley's true passion as a Blazer. He played on Blair's team for three years and was named an All-Metropolitan player in his senior year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Accepting his induction, Beasley reflected on how he found his true passion for physics late into his high school years. "It was not until my senior year at which point I took my first physics course. [My teacher] definitely stimulated my interest in physics. I think he awakened the inner nerd in me," Beasley says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When his rigorous college classes interfered with basketball practice, Beasley chose to pursue academics rather than continue with sports. His physics focus drove him down a long but rewarding path of success, culminating in his position as President of the American Physical Society in 2014.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Carol Mehrling ('66)</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the first female Police Chief of the Montgomery County Police Department, Carol Mehrling smashed through barriers both while at Blair and in the workplace. Her brother, Ken Mehrling, accepted her induction in her memory, describing her life in and outside of high school.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32342"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a Blazer, Mehrling was both studious and spirited with her investments in countless volunteer activities and clubs, which foreshadowed her future in public service. She participated in the National Honor Society and in the Dance, Safety and Homecoming Committees, all while never failing to show her school pride at Blair sports events.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After her graduation, Mehrling’s father, a police radio dispatcher, submitted Mehrling in a scholarship competition from the County Police, which she won. This set up the rest of her education and training at Montgomery College and Towson University. Upon joining the MCPD, Mehrling quickly flew up the ranks, earning the position of Chief in 1995.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Throughout her achievement in the Police Force, Carol Mehrling’s positive mindset set her apart from everyone around her. “I think my sister would want me to end by passing this message on...fight for all you believe in and create it… and everyone deserves a hug, especially from the chief,” concludes Ken Mehrling.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Eliot Pfanstiehl ('68)</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Class of 1968 inductee Eliot Pfanstiehl's accomplishments are exhibited in the Music Center at Strathmore in North Bethesda, a nonprofit multi-disciplinary arts center that hosts multiple performances of both renowned artists and local ensembles daily.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From its high, sloping ceiling designed for clarity and reverberation to its iconic walkway featuring glowing rainbow lights, Strathmore is known for its breathtaking design and acoustics. This can be greatly attributed to the efforts of Pfanstiehl, founder and former CEO of Strathmore.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pfanstiehl dedicated most of his adult life to developing and holding leadership positions in performing arts programs, including the Montgomery County Arts Council, the League of Washington Theatres, Friends of the Kennedy Center, the Maryland State Arts Council and Maryland Citizens for the Arts.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">His devotion to Strathmore and performing arts in general stems back to his musical experiences at Blair's former Wayne Avenue campus. "The reason I built Strathmore was because, in my day, Blair did its musicals in the gymnasium. Do you know what the acoustics are like in a gymnasium?" Pfanstiehl asks as he addresses the audience in the newly developed Alumni Hall, also known as Blair's auditorium.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pfanstiehl states that Blair was a large influence on him as a person. "It [Blair] shaped us and made us who we are. Just like us, you have been shaped by this place. Your ethics have been shaped, your sense of fairness, justice, honor, righteousness came in some way from the hundred conversations you had right here at Blair," Pfanstiehl says. "Thanks Blair, you done good."</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brian Magid ('75)</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One of the best basketball players in Blair history, Brian Magid led the Blazers to victory before graduating in 1975. During his senior year, he led the basketball team in scoring, securing them the County and State Championships.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Magid described how the Blair sports environment was one he could never forget. “There was nothing like playing with your friends, your family, at our school, in that intimate fanatic-packed Blair fieldhouse. Everything about those years at Blair with basketball has left great memories," he remembers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Magid’s stellar basketball performance extended far beyond high school as he dominated the court on George Washington University’s team in his senior year and led the nation in free throws. Though the Indian Pacers drafted him for their team, Magid ended up playing professional basketball in Israel instead.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Summarizing his time at Blair, Magid turns to thank his teammates and supporters along his basketball career. “We created great memories, and we made people happy. There's no better legacy than that, ” he appraises.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jacque Crenca Hinman ('79)</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the CEO of a Fortune 500&nbsp;consulting, design and construction company, CH2M Hill, Jaque Crenca Hinman has countless major engineering and infrastructure projects under her belt. Attending Penn State University post-graduation, Hinman quickly rose to prominence in the fields of engineering and infrastructure.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32340"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During her Blair years, Hinman shined as a member of National Honor Society and Spanish Honor Society, and especially as President of the poms team. This enthusiasm and determination to be involved in the community, fused with Blair’s moral code, led her to success at her engineering firm.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hinman believes that Blair's environment guided her towards a successful mindset.&nbsp;“The student body and faculty’s diversity in culture, race, religion, and socioeconomic status... [Blair’s] way of being and thinking and feeling has stayed with me my whole life and was critical in helping me as a Fortune 500 CEO,&nbsp;“ Hinman deliberates.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many recognizable projects that Hinman has worked on with CH2M Hill include infrastructure for the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games. Retrospectively, she remembers where it all started. “Not bad for the downcounty academic underdogs,” she says.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Carlos "Chick" Hernandez ('81)</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chick Hernandez's time at Blair echoed with the sounds of mischief and laughter. "My crowning achievements were being voted class clown from grades 1-12,"&nbsp;he says. Teacher after teacher would become exasperated yet amused by Hernandez's knack for finding trouble and the various nicknames he gave himself: Hollywood, Dazzle, Razzle, Leo, Moses and more.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32339"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Throughout middle and high school, Hernandez was dedicated to the Boy's Service (BS) Club. "It was a microcosm of Blair. We had greasers, nerds, jocks, all colors, all religions in the club, and they helped teach me to make a decision on people based on my interactions with them-not to assume anything," he says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hernandez also devoted much of his high school years to playing in three sports: football, baseball, and swimming. Rather than continuing athletics beyond high school, Hernandez used his comical disposition to pursue a career as an Emmy-awarded sportscaster, combining his interest in sports with his dedication to the diverse local community. He worked for NBC Sports Washington and garnered support from fans in the area.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hernandez again emphasized his love for the Blair community while accepting the award, "High school helps shape so many of us because of where we are in our lives when we get there. What a thrill to come home and be in front of my people."</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Craig Rice ('90)</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many recognize Craig Rice as a Montgomery County councilman serving his diverse community, but at Blair, his education pointed to something very different. Graduating from Blair’s Math, Science, and Computer Science Magnet Program in 1990, Rice attended the University of Maryland before diving into politics and public service.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32338"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rice's tendency to reach out to the community is reflected in the activities he participated in at Blair. As a magnet student,&nbsp;Rice felt isolated from the rest of his classmates, leading him to join various clubs such as the mock trial team, ski club and architecture club to connect more to the general Blair population. "It gave me opportunities to meet people I wouldn't have normally met and be able to establish friendships and relationships and get to know different kinds of people," Rice says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the chair of the Council’s Education and Culture Committee, Rice supports schools in Montgomery County by fighting for access for everyone and ensuring that "nobody gets left behind" by the school system. Rice describes how these goals were exhibited in his Blair a community as well. "The inspiration, entertainment, everything that we value in our community, that we value in our society, we've been able to do it all at a great school… We've heard stories of how we stepped up to support our Blazers when they were in a time of need," Rice says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Each of the 2019 inductees has paved the way for others to benefit from their interests after their time at Blair, whether it be through shaping policy, building public infrastructure, providing entertainment or furthering science. "You don't have to be a Blazer to be a trailblazer, but I'll tell you this: being a Blazer makes you a very special trailblazer," Rice concludes.</span></p>	32340
31978	The classic Tarantino movie’s nuanced nostalgia may be lost on some	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” is sure to whisk the audience back to 1969 Los Angeles. The movie, directed by Quentin Tarantino, captures the luxury and absurdity of old Hollywood. The story follows Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), an actor known for playing the “bad guy” in TV westerns, and his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt).&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31977"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rick Dalton’s claim to fame is his role as the villain in “Bounty Law,” Tarantino’s recreation of a classic Western within the movie. “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” leads the audience through Dalton’s experience finding his way through a Hollywood that no longer values his work. With Booth acting as his best friend, chauffeur and assistant all while being his stunt double, Dalton struggles to navigate the decline of his career.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The movie also delves into the true story of famous actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), who was murdered by members of the Manson family—&nbsp;a cult led by Charles Manson in the California desert— in the summer of 1969. While the movie does not depict the murder of Tate, Cliff Booth’s fictional interactions with a hippie girl named Pussycat lead to a strange encounter with the cult living on an abandoned ranch.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the name suggests, this film is simply a story told about the past. Tarantino presents the Hollywood he grew up with to the younger generation. While the story is compelling and the acting is excellent, its nostalgic nature is what makes it so unique. “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” is a compilation of Tarantino’s interests: the architecture, fashion, music, slang and more just scream 1960s. For a new generation of moviegoers who aren’t familiar with this era of Hollywood, this movie has the potential to be a compelling throwback.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Quentin Tarrantino is a critically acclaimed writer and director whose most well-known movies include “Pulp Fiction” and “Kill Bill.” His movies are also known to include some extremely graphic violence and pop culture references, both of which appear in “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both DiCaprio and Pitt give excellent performances, making the audience cry one minute and laugh the next. While the movie was generally comedic, some moments left audiences close to tears or with fearful goosebumps.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although the references to Hollywood’s golden age and the excellent acting were noteworthy, it is difficult to stay interested during the first half of the movie since the story moves at a grudgingly slow pace. However, the end of the movie certainly does not disappoint with its sudden change in tone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” isn’t for those who prefer to stay away from stylized and nuanced films with many overlapping storylines. While Tarantino exemplified the masterful directing that he is known for, the nostalgia of this movie may be lost on some.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For audiences that appreciate Tarantino’s style and love old Hollywood films, this is the perfect summer movie.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” is rated R for graphic violence, strong language, and alcohol and drug use. It is playing at Regal Majestic &amp; IMAX and the AFI in Silver Spring.&nbsp;</em></p>	31977
32447	Captains Zaire Cooper and Chris Watkins plan to commit to a collegiate team in the near future	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair football's senior offensive lineman Zaire Cooper and senior running back Christopher Watkins have both received at least one National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I (D1) offers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Dec. 5, Cooper and Watkins both received offers from Marist College. They have an opportunity to play another four years together. "It's cool, I never thought it would happen in all honesty," Cooper said. Watkins agrees that it's a great thing. "Getting to spend another possible four years with someone I’ve played with and trying to accomplish the same things basically is great to think about," he said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32446"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cooper has received seven NCAA offers so far (as of Dec. 24), with his first coming on June 21 from Davidson College (D1). He received his other offers on Sept. 29 from Morgan State University (D1), on Oct. 24 from Concord University (D2), on Nov. 22 from Colby College (D3), on Nov. 23 from Oberlin College (D3), on Dec. 5 from Marist College (D1) and on Dec. 22 from Shenandoah University (D3).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Watkins' offer from Marist College is his first and only offer as of Dec. 24. After missing his junior year due to a broken fibula and torn deltoid ligament, Watkins' recruiting process was stunted. "Missing last season definitely hurt because that’s 10 less games I got to showcase my talents. Then, questions of durability came into play for recruiting," Watkins said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A major part of Watkins' recovery was physical therapy, and learning how to run and walk again. "I can't forget [to thank] Ms. Meghan, our previous and lovely trainer, because without her helping me all year with my physical therapy I might not have had the senior year I had," Watkins said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Receiving offers after years of hard work is certainly a relief for Cooper and Watkins. "It’s a bit relieving knowing I’ll have an opportunity at a high level of education and a high level of football," Watkins said. Cooper agreed that having the chance to continue pursuing both academics and athletics is rewarding. "It’s as if everything I’ve done has finally paid off. [Whether] it was athletically, academically or socially, it feels like I’ve made some great moves," he said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cooper thanked his mother for helping him get to the point where he is now. "Especially since she’s not the typical football mom, it makes me feel great that she’s doing this all for me, and not just football," Cooper said. "She's definitely helped me the most."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Making the best decision possible can be hard for the student-athletes, especially when there are several colleges to consider, such as culture, coaching, education and the team's talent itself. "[I consider] the combination of how good their football is and how good their academics are. I see how they are as a family, what their culture is like and all of that," Cooper said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although National Signing Day has passed for football, announcements can still come later. Watkins aims to make his commitment announcement around late January, and Cooper's decision date is unknown.</span></p>	32446
32001	The sequel has all the elements of a stereotypical shark thriller	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Complete with clichéd dialogue, poorly-developed characters and a predictable plot, "47 Meters Down: Uncaged" is exactly what one would expect from a shark movie.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film follows the daughter and stepdaughter of Grant (John Corbett), a diver who recently discovered an underwater Mayan city in Yucatán, Mexico. His daughter Mia (Sophie Nélisse) and stepdaughter Sasha (Corinne Foxx) drive to a secluded lagoon with Sasha's friends Alexa (Brianne Tju) and Nicole (Sistine Stallone). Nicole convinces them to go scuba diving in one of the caves of the city that Grant is excavating, whose entrance conveniently happens to be located in the lagoon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The girls quickly realize that they are not alone in the cave, and must make their way through the maze-like city. As they journey through the labyrinth, the oxygen supply dwindles, the shark's kill streak goes up and the girls get increasingly panicked.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The characters in the movie are ironically very shallow. The majority only care about themselves, focusing on nothing but their own chances of survival. But none could possibly be more focused on self-preservation than Nicole who destroys an escape route in an attempt to save her own skin. As a matter of fact, her entire personality seems to revolve around making idiotic decisions that endanger the rest of the group.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There isn't much to be said of the rest of the characters, either. Although the other three teens seem to possess more common sense than their friend, the viewer doesn't get to know much about them before they are thrust into the deep.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The plot was incredibly similar to that of the original "47 Meters Down." There are a few predictable jump scares. The dialogue consists mostly of gasps, heavy breathing, and high-pitched screams. Not to mention that the "sharks" look like they're made out of rubber (which they probably are).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The filmmakers attempt to make up for their uninteresting plot by casting Foxx and Stallone, daughters of successful Hollywood actors Jamie Foxx and Sylvester Stallone. But while their acting wasn't awful, it certainly wasn't award-winning.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32000"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Unfortunately for director Johannes Robert, "47 Meters Down: Uncaged" doesn't quite live up to the reputation of the original. Admittedly, it is difficult to produce any shark horror movie that doesn't come across as predictable or cliché because the writers must find a balance between eliminating too many or too few characters. If too many die the movie comes across as downright gory, but if too few die it's not frightening enough. Since there's such a fine line between too many and not enough, only so many plot points can be written in that haven't been used before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For anyone considering watching it who has already seen a shark movie, don't bother. Your oxygen, like Nicole's, could be put to better use.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"47 Meters Down: Uncaged" is rated PG-13 for violence and gore and is now playing at Regal Majestic &amp; IMAX and Regal Hyattsville Royale.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32000
32449	SCO's predictions with about a quarter of the season gone	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The National Basketball Association (NBA) season is in full swing. The Lakers are exceeding expectations, people are complaining about Kawhi Leonard's load management, and Luka Doncic is tearing the league up with his smooth moves. With about a quarter of the season gone, here are award predictions, courtesy of SCO.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32448"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Most Valuable Player: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The race for the Maurice Podoloff Trophy (NBA MVP award) will be tight all season. James Harden is averaging nearly 40 points per game (PPG) and Luka Doncic is almost averaging a double-double (he's even close to a triple-double). With that being said, the Greek Freak is (averaging through 28 games) 31.8 ppg, 12.8 rebounds per game (RPG), 5.4 assists per game (APG), 1.3 steals per game (SPG) and 1.3 blocks per game (BPG). In addition, Milwaukee has won 25 of their 29 regular season games. It is certainly possible as we move along that players such as Anthony Davis, Doncic, Harden, LeBron James and others may move into the MVP race.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rookie of the Year: Ja Morant, Memphis Grizzlies</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This 2019 NBA Draft class has been stellar to date, but Ja Morant has been sensational for Memphis so far. His play style is extremely professional, almost veteran-like, and he's not the average rookie by any means. While Memphis hasn't been great, at 10-19, Morant leads his team in scoring, assists and steals with 18.4 ppg, 6.7 apg and 1.2 spg. If Morant weren't to win, Miami's Kendrick Nunn or Tyler Herro, Washington's Rui Hachimura and Golden State's Eric Paschall have also been playing very well, and would all be deserving of the ROTY honor.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Most Improved Player: Devonte' Graham, Charlotte Hornets</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is an absolute no-brainer. Charlotte selected Graham with their second-round pick in 2018. Graham's rookie year seemed average at best for a second-rounder. In only 46 regular season appearances, Graham averaged just 4.7 PPG and 2.6 APG. In the 2019-20 season (through 31 appearances), he has become an unexpected star for the Hornets, averaging 19.1 PPG, 7.5 APG and 3.7 RPG, including an amazing 40-point performance against Brooklyn. I can't see anyone else winning the MIP.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Defensive Player of the Year: Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Anthony Davis has been absolutely thriving on his new team in Los Angeles. He leads the league in bpg, with 2.6, averages 9.4 rpg and 1.4 spg. From a more advanced standpoint, he has a 6.1 plus/minus, 103.6 defensive rating and 18.7 defensive rebound percentage. Rudy Gobert is a possible repeat winner, along with Draymond Green and Kawhi Leonard.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">6th Man of the Year: Lou Williams, Los Angeles Clippers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lou Williams is the face of this award. He has won the award three times, tied for the most ever with Jamal Crawford. In his 14th year in the league, it's no surprise that Williams is still a candidate this year. Coming off the bench, he is averaging 19.4 ppg, 6.2 apg and 3.1 rpg in 30.2 minutes per game (MPG). Other candidates include Montrezl Harrell, also from the Clippers, as well as Brooklyn's Spencer Dinwiddie.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The season has brought plenty of surprises. Trae Young and Luka Doncic are putting up amazing numbers in just their second NBA season. LeBron is having one of his best seasons at 34-years-old. There is plenty of talent in the league this year. A lot could change through the course of an NBA season, though, and new players can burst onto the scene as a new MVP or ROTY candidate.</span></p><p><a href="https://stats.nba.com" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>All statistics</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> are accurate as of Dec. 21, 2019 at noon.</em></p>	32448

32931	Despite America’s general unwillingness to take action in advance, we must in order to prevent the worst effects of global warming	<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Ever-rising temperatures. Mass flooding and heatwaves. These are just some of the effects that climate change will have on the world, as hypothesized by </span><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">NASA</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. Given this, it is easy to say that something has to be done about climate change. Most reasonable people would agree with this, but they are vague on the details. With the numerous current problems, the comparatively distant threat of global warming doesn’t seem too bad. While waiting might seem like an option, the fact of the matter is that when the effects of global warming become too much to ignore, it will be too late to take any meaningful action.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32930"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Historically, America doesn’t have the best track record for dealing with crises, and its strategy seems to be to wait until the problem cannot be ignored, and then finally take action. While part of this is human nature, as it is naturally easier to accept a problem when directly faced with it, the American government in particular has followed this trend. This tendency to only act at the last second often has consequences and, almost always, dealing with the problem earlier would have saved a lot of the trouble. As an example of this pattern, we can look at how the coronavirus crisis has played out.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Back in January, coronavirus cases were just beginning to appear in China, according to </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/timeline-coronavirus-started/story?id=69435165" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">ABC News</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, and by the end of January, Wuhan was in lockdown. Despite drastic </span><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/china-s-aggressive-measures-have-slowed-coronavirus-they-may-not-work-other-countries" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">measures</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> like putting cities in lockdown and canceling most social events, deaths did occur, but many were prevented due to the swift actions of the government. The same article shows that the first coronavirus case in America appeared just days after China’s, but although the WHO (World Health Organization) declared a global health emergency in February, President Trump did nothing until the middle of March, when he finally declared a national emergency. This happened partly because Americans didn’t want to accept that there was a problem, and partly because of the politicization of a health crisis that affected everyone, threatened the livelihoods of millions, and had no reason to be made political, much like global warming. As a result, cases in America are still extremely high, the economy is in shambles with an unemployment rate of 10.2 percent as of </span><a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/unemployment-rate-states/#:~:text=Data%20delivered%20to%20your%20inbox&amp;text=Between%20June%20and%20July%2C%20the,employers%20added%201.8%20million%20jobs." target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">July</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. People are wondering, “could this have been better?”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The answer is, quite possibly. Looking at China’s response, it is likely that a quicker response to the crisis before it became too pressing an issue to ignore could have helped America contain the coronavirus more easily, and possibly allowed us to be in a period of recovery right now, instead of a rapid downward spiral. The general lesson that could be taken away from the coronavirus crisis is that decisive action before the problem gets too big to control is necessary in most cases. So why aren’t we doing anything about climate change?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With everything going on in the world right now, climate change seems like the least of our problems. This is how people have viewed climate change for decades, but due to this approach, many disasters are nearer than most people realize. </span><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-1/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to an IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> from 2018, the global temperature is expected to rise a minimum of 1.5</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">° Celsius (34.7° Fahrenheit) as soon as 2033. At this point, there is no way we can stop climate change. The world failed to take any meaningful measures decades ago, and now the crisis is very nearly here. However, there are ways that the world could limit the rise to 1.5° Celsius, instead of doing very nearly nothing and letting temperatures climb even higher.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Doing nothing seems to be the American government's main goal. For years, climate change was ignored, and Trump has appeared to make it his priority to go back on as many climate protections as humanly possible. This includes leaving the Paris Climate Agreement, an international agreement for countries to limit carbon output and try their best to stop irreversibly ruining the earth. Unfortunately, despite coming closer than ever to the world as we know it being changed by global warming, it is still not the most “important” topic at any given time. People now more than ever are concerned about the impending climate catastrophe, but very little mainstream attention is focused on it.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is not to say that no one is trying. </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">The Green New Deal</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, a bill cosponsored by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), introduces a program that would drastically reduce emissions, shift America towards using more renewable energy, and try to mitigate the effects of global warming. This bill, however, is held back by the fact that climate change has become concerningly politicized. Instead of an issue that everyone should agree on due to the threat it poses to animals, human life and property, climate change has become the left versus the right. In this case, the left believes that we should try to prevent this disaster, while many on the right either don’t believe in climate change or think that making changes wouldn’t be worth the economic risk.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For these reasons, climate change is an extremely important topic, and one that should be brought up much more often by politicians. America’s tendency to delay action until the last moment meant disaster for the coronavirus outbreak, and it may very well mean disaster for the entire planet if we continue like this. While this is mainly the fault of politicians caring more for short-term profits than long-term goals like keeping humanity alive, it can also be traced to the fact that we as citizens don’t bring it up as often as we should. So we need to change this. Bring up climate change more, ask politicians to act, anything that can help. Yes, there will always be other problems that seem more “immediate,” more “pressing,” but if we fail to act until climate change is the “immediate” problem, we know from history that it won’t end well.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32930
33044	Enrollment has dropped off this fall in light of remote learning realities in MCPS	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Following an announcement from MCPS on July 21 that students would not return to in-person school for at least the first semester, a large number of MCPS families opted to unenroll in favor of private education or homeschooling options.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the Montgomery County Board of Education (BOE) meeting on Oct. 6, MCPS revealed that the enrollment total for the 2020-2021 school year is 161,150 students, marking a drop-off of more than 4,100 students since last year, when enrollment totaled 165,267.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to Superintendent Jack Smith at a Board meeting on Sept. 13, this large shift has for the most part occurred in elementary schools. While most middle and high schools met their expected enrollment numbers this year, no elementary schools reached their projections.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Melissa Wilets, the mother of a 12-year-old starting sixth grade this year, decided to transfer her son to the independent Washington Waldorf School due to the high screen time MCPS expects of students amidst virtual learning. She disapproved of the county’s learning model in the spring, noting the “heavy reliance on technology.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Wilets already knew a family with a student enrolled at Waldorf who had a positive experience with the school’s virtual learning strategy. “We heard good reports about how they were teaching the kids and how they were able to translate what they normally do to this new environment,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When she initially transferred her son, Wilets hoped that he would be learning in a physical classroom; instead, the Waldorf school adopted a hybrid model, including both virtual and in-person learning. “They are going in person once a week and have an hour and a half with their teachers and classmates outside with masks on,” she said. “I think that’s really made a difference. Kids get to interact with each other in person, which isn’t happening with MCPS.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Caroline Quinn also changed schools in light of COVID-19, transferring from Walt Whitman to St. Andrews Episcopal School in Potomac. Quinn is satisfied with her decision because she will be going back to school in person as soon as this week. “It’s hard to feel like you’re really going to school right now because we are still online, but I’m looking forward to going in person,” she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Last year, only 74 students unenrolled in MCPS in favor of homeschooling. However, this year almost 1,080 students have left the public school system to be homeschooled, according to data presented to the&nbsp;BOE.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33043"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hemakshi Gordy, who graduated from Blair in 2020 and decided to take a gap year due to COVID-19, has been tutoring two elementary school students. They unenrolled from MCPS over the summer and are homeschooling this year.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gordy explained that the students were due to start kindergarten and second grade at Takoma Park Elementary School this fall. However, when MCPS unveiled its new virtual learning plan over the summer, their mother decided that homeschooling would be a better fit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a single parent working a full-time job, the students’ mother does not have the capacity to help two small children with their schoolwork throughout the day along with her job, so she decided to hire Gordy to teach them in person. “It was going to be hours and hours of Zoom, something like nine a.m. to three in the afternoon for elementary school kids, and that is absolutely not reasonable or possible for most families,” Gordy said, “let alone for families where both parents are working or parents who don’t speak English. It just wasn’t going to work out.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Elizabeth Danielski, a Blair junior, also seriously considered a switch to private school over the summer. However unlike Wilets and her family, Danielski decided to remain in MCPS.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Danielski explained that the private schools that she looked into did not have the same diversity in course options as Blair, so by remaining in public school she has the opportunity to take the classes that she’s interested in. “AP Chemistry is one of the classes that the private schools we looked at didn’t have… so I’m glad that I got to stay with MCPS for that,” she said, “but on the other hand, a lot of private schools are open now, and for a lot of my other classes, that would probably be a more effective method of learning.”</span></p>	33043

32377	The restaurant chain recently pledged to stop donating to anti-LGBTQ+ organizations	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Monday, Nov. 18, restaurant chain Chick-fil-A announced that starting next year, it will stop donating to anti-LGBTQ+ organizations Salvation Army and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA). Besides its popular chicken sandwiches and customer service, Chick-fil-A is also known for its long-term financial commitment to Christian organizations and beliefs.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32376"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both the FCA and the Salvation Army are Christian organizations dedicated to enforcing Christian values, and both have </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/business/chick-fil-a-lgbtq-donations/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">explicitly written</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> against homosexuality and same-sex marriage.

"No organization will be excluded from future consideration—faith-based or non-faith-based," Tassopoulos said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the midst of the controversy and confusion, other Blazers decide to simply focus on the food. Junior Chad Yu continues to eat a Chick-fil-A twice a week because of the quality of their chicken. “I don’t really care about people criticizing me, because I just enjoy their food," Yu said. "I was indifferent before, but with the recent news, I do feel better that people aren’t looking at me in that way anymore."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazer Imogene Weiss agrees that a company’s donations doesn’t impact her decisions. “Food is food, but I respect my friends who don’t want to go there. With the recent news, I think it’s a little too late for the company to backtrack, and everyone already knows their values,” Weiss said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chick-fil-A is not the only corporation that has made controversial donations before.

33252	A look into Blair’s new chapter in the Entrepreneurship program.	<p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Have you ever wondered why school doesn’t focus on teaching students how to do taxes, manage money, or get out of student debt? A reason why is the general conception that the government shouldn’t mandate things like graduation requirements. Maryland non-profit, Innovate X works to change the high school curriculum so more students graduate with excellent financial literacy skills while encouraging entrepreneurial minds.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Innovate X was founded by Richard Montgomery High school junior, Katie Yuan. In less than a year, Yuan's organization has established chapters all over the world from Indonesia, India, to Egypt, to Blair high school. Through afterschool programs, </span><a href="https://www.innovate-x.org/blog" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">econ watch</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (official blog), and many programs, Innovate X advocates for more opportunities to be given to students in order for them to become financially literate and responsible.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Beginning</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sixteen-year-old Katie Yuan began developing Innovate X when quarantine began and the economy started to suffer even more. “During that time, I would often see in the news that the economy is going into a recession and millions of people are losing their jobs. I’m just thinking that schools from across the country and especially Montgomery county too don't really account for personal finance,” Yuan says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yuan would often ask herself: What can she do to help out this issue? Yuan argues that school often doesn’t prepare students for the future. She explains that only 24% of millennials demonstrate basic financial literacy skills. . “During school we have math, english, social studies, science, but when we go into the real world [these subjects will barely help students]. What are the chances that you're going to need to know how to graph a parabola unless you are an engineer or in a math related occupation?” Yuan continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After realizing the problem, Yuan contacted multiple nonprofits advocating for financial literacy. These include MD Cash Campaign, Financial Beginnings, Jumpstart, Chris Do, and Fulphil. Using her connections, Yuan was able to find dedicated team members to help her run Innovate X. She then began brainstorming ways that her organization can accomplish the goal of greater financial literacy. After finishing the legal paperwork (IRS Tax Exempt 503c status + Incorporation) and creating the Innovate X website/social media, Yuan’s journey had come to an official start. Through setting short-term and long-term goals, Yuan was able to quickly grow her non-profit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Present</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Juniors Hawon Lee and Emily Liu started Montgomery Blair’s chapter of Innovate X. “We first found out about the Innovate X organization [over the summer] and we wanted to get involved. We decided to start a chapter at Blair where we can branch out and get more schools/students to know about the organization,” Lee explains. As the Blair chapter's presidents, Lee and Liu also serve on the non-profit organization's executive board.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Currently Innovate X is working on Project Finance and the Incubator Program. Project Finance “consists of students who are willing to testify for the organization and advocate for the inclusion of financial classes in the schools curriculum so that more students will be exposed to these skills before they leave high school,” Lee explains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Incubator Program “gets students into submitting a start-up idea. The students then get mentors to get advice on how to start their start-up. Later on they’re gonna pitch their ideas and then in June, the funds will start for their project,” Liu states.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As chapter presidents, Lee and Liu organize discussions on ways Blair students can get involved (with the community) and conduct InnovateX's main projects on a local level. "We host a lot of different programs which can adhere to the needs of different students makes it really special, especially if you are interested in different parts of entrepreneurship or starting a business,” Lee says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chapter members mainly stick to writing about the economy. “Right now we are working on publishing articles and creating graphics for those articles. The articles have three categories that they go into. One of them is talking about the current economic situation. Another one is advice for other youth entrepreneurs, and the last one is doing exclusive interviews with founders of other youth-wide organizations,” Liu states.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The publications team consist of writers and graphic designers. The Education team makes the curriculums for the after-school programs. The public relations team is in charge of the organization's social media. The financial team applies for grants and reaches out to potential sponsors. The International outreach team works to reach marginalized populations that are in need and make sure that they are heard and included. They do this by conducting workshops and establishing numerous projects for greater inclusion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If you have dreams of being an entrepreneur, consider joining Innovate X. Executive meetings are bi-weekly while Chapter meetings are monthly. Anyone is free to join the Chapter at any time they’d like. Executive team applications only come once a year so keep a look out for those on the organizations website, </span><a href="https://www.innovate-x.org/about" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Innovate X.</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	33251

33167	SCO investigates student sleep patterns during the pandemic.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When quarantine started, Blazers and students around the nation rejoiced at the thought of being able to sleep in every morning. Nine months later, it turns out that many Americans are still struggling with sleep, despite the extra time.

Coronasomnia can affect all age groups, including high school students.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In June, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274952/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">researchers at the National Institutes of Health</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> conducted a study on how Americans were sleeping during the start of quarantine, as well as the pandemic’s effects on mental health overall. “The main findings, as expected, revealed very high rates of clinically significant insomnia (20%), acute stress (15.8%), anxiety (18.5%), and depression (24.5%),” researchers Charles Morin and Julie Carrier write.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Coronasomnia is caused primarily by stress, which has worsened significantly during the pandemic. The COVID-19 virus itself has caused many to worry about the health of their families and themselves, and for the </span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/oct/how-many-lost-jobs-employer-coverage-pandemic" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">15.9 million Americans who lost their jobs due to the pandemic,</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> financial struggles only add to their stress.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another cause of coronasomnia is a lack of stimulation in our daily routines. During lockdown, a lot of normally exciting activities (like going to the movies or going to a restaurant) became impossible.

We need some variety in our activities. When our lives become so repetitive, the lack of stimulation and activities contributes to poor sleep,” Drake says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For a lot of Americans, working from home has also led to broken sleep habits. Many people are working and sleeping at drastically different times than before, and sudden changes in our sleep schedules mess with our circadian rhythms. The more you change your sleep schedule, the harder it is for your body to adjust, making it harder to fall asleep.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Because of this, general sleep quality in the U.S. has been going down in the past few months, based on </span><a href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/how-have-sleep-habits-changed-amid-covid-19" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">research done by the American Journal of Managed Care</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. For most students, however, online school has allowed for more and better quality sleep than before quarantine, while still enforcing a normal sleep routine.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In a SCO survey, Blazers were asked how many hours of sleep they got per night before the pandemic and how many hours of sleep they get now.

Unlike the rest of the nation, which mostly saw decreases in hours of sleep due to coronasomnia, 64 percent of surveyed Blazers say they get more sleep now than they did before quarantine. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is mostly thanks to the later starting time of online school (from 7:45 am to 9 am), which accounts for the hour increase in Blazers’ average sleep per night. Furthermore, regulated start times for school prevents students from sleeping in too much, while still allowing them to get more sleep than before.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For freshman Sudhish Swain, the delayed start time has helped him transition easily between middle and high school. In fact, online learning has helped him improve his sleep schedule by quite a bit. “I used to sleep at 11 p.m. and wake up at 6 a.m. to go to school. Now I sleep at 10:30 p.m. and wake up at 8:00 a.m. That’s like 2.5 hours more,” Swain notes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For freshmen, transitioning from middle to high school is often difficult due to the higher levels of stress. Having the chance to get extra sleep during online learning has helped them balance their stress levels and ease them into the high school experience.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33164"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Likewise, for Blazers who struggled with balancing healthy sleep schedules before the pandemic, quarantine has allowed them to gradually find a better way to sleep well. For senior Anika Dasgupta, even though her workload has increased significantly this year, quarantine has still allowed her to get more sleep than before. The delayed start time has allowed her to nearly double her average sleep per night, and she feels a lot more focused with the extra sleep. “Instead of sleeping from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m., I'm sleeping from 3 a.m. to 9 a.m. Now I don't literally pass out during class because I'm tired,” Dasgupta says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As we continue into our second quarter of online school, getting enough good quality sleep remains just as important as before. So far, the majority of Blazers have been sleeping well during quarantine and are doing a good job of balancing stress and maintaining good sleep schedules. Let’s make sure to keep it up!</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33164
32729	The Blazers beat the Jaguars by a score of 56-27	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (13-5) beat the Northwest Jaguars (3-15) by a score of 56-27 on Friday night. The highly successful and spirited senior night celebrated center Adia Keene, guard Zoe Abramson, and guard-forward Lucy Martin.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Keene started the night out strong by winning the tip-off and immediately making a two-pointer. Despite a few missed shots and fouls, Blair was successfully able to limit Northwest to 5 points in the first quarter. The Blazers left the Jaguars struggling to shoot, and they continuously obtained defensive rebounds leading to more scoring opportunities. Blair’s 9-5 lead after the first quarter only grew as the night went on.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior guard Kate Hildebrandt was a powerful offensive force in the second quarter, scoring eight points. Fierce passes and visible communication kept Blair on their path to victory. The Blazers shot well throughout the game,&nbsp;with 15 points from Hildebrandt, 10 points from sophomore guard Emily Liu, and 7 points from Lucy Martin. Despite several riskyshots in the third quarter from Blair, Northwest could not make a comeback. This led to Blair’s ultimate 56-27 victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This game marked a comeback from recent losses to Churchill and Walter Johnson due to offensive issues. Coach Ferguson highlighted the Blazers’ success with layups throughout the game. “We’ve talked a lot at practice about getting the ball to the paint, not necessarily always having to score from the paint, but getting that opens up shots. We got the ball in the paint a lot tonight, which was good and that got us the layups,” Ferguson said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Defense was another highlight of the game. Hildebrant, Liu, and Keene were able to collectively steal the ball 11 times, contributing to the subsequent offensive success. “It’s actually funny. We spent most of the year in man or a 3-2 zone but tonight we decided to switch things up and it worked,” Keene said. Different rotations and intensity led to a lot of deflections and Northwest turnovers. The Blazers possessed the ball for a large part of the game.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;Following the victory, seniors discussed how Blair basketball has shaped them. “This program is really special for me,” Keene said. Lucy Martin agreed. “This team will always have a place in my heart. I’ve been with Coach Ferg for four years and every year I’ve enjoyed it,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ferguson shared the sentiment. “These girls have been with me since my first year on JV, so it’s pretty special to see them go all the way. I think that they’re having a great senior year and they’re playing to their potential, which is awesome,” she concluded.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, February 21st against the Walt Whitman Vikings at 5:30 p.m.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Editor’s Note: Lucy Martin is the photo editor for Silver Chips Print.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32730
33269	Pro-sports leagues’ changing reaction to social activism.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOn July 13, the football team based in Washington, D.C. announced that they were changing their name from the Washington Redskins to the Washington Football Team—an announcement that had been long awaited by many across the country.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33268"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">﻿The Washington Football Team had been known as the “Redskins” for over 80 years, despite it being widely considered a slur against Native Americans. Protests, demonstrations, and boycotts have all called for a name change since 1972, but Dan Snyder, the owner of the team, famously stated in a USA Today interview, "We’ll never change the name. It’s that simple. NEVER—you can use caps.” Pressure increased on Snyder and the rest of the organization following the killing of George Floyd and the social reckoning that followed. Investors no longer wanted to associate with the team’s brand. Nike pulled all of the team’s merchandise off of their website. FedEx, the brand for which their stadium is named, formally asked the team to change their name.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;In mid-July, the team’s management finally relented. While activists recognized this decision as a step in the right direction, many believe that Snyder only changed the name because he knew he had no other choice. In an interview with ABC, Billy Tayac, Chief of the Piscataway Tribe in the Chesapeake Bay region, said, “With Mr. Snyder, what put the pressure on him to change the name? Money talks and that's what he realizes.”</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The current climate</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe name change comes as part of a series of reforms and donations from sports leagues across the country. The National Football League (NFL) has pledged to donate $250 million over ten years to help combat racism; the National Basketball Association (NBA): $300 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tGeorge Solomon, former sports editor at the Washington Post and founder of the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism, told Silver Chips that he thinks viewers are pushing to allow athletes to use their national platform to protest. “The social fabric of the country is changing, and there is a demand for athletes to speak out more than ever,” he explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn the opening weekend of the NFL 2020 season, five teams—including upper management—remained inside their locker rooms for both the playing of the national anthem and of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song often referred to as the Black national anthem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn a public statement, the Green Bay Packers, one of the teams that opted to stay in the locker room, explained their rationale: “We decided as a team to remain in the locker room… so as to not distract from our message that we stand united for social justice and racial equality. This is part of our continued call on our leaders to engage in meaningful dialogue that results in change.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tStatements like these from teams’ front offices were especially impactful, as just two years ago, many of them were fining players for protesting in their own way.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;In the NBA, many players decided to strike and leave the stadium before their playoff games began on Aug. 26, in protest of the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, temporarily halting the NBA playoffs. Following their lead, many players in Major League Baseball, the Women’s National Basketball Association, and Major League Soccer striked as well. College sports cancelled practices and games.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOnce the NBA players called off their protest, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Associations released a statement explaining that the NBA and their players had formed a coalition, designed to create a forum for all those involved with the NBA to share their views on social justice and to try to create joint change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn addition, both the NBA and NFL allowed their players to wear statements about social activism on their respective jerseys and helmets, in order to raise awareness for the issues most important to them. Sayings such as “Say Her Name,” in reference to the killing of Breonna Taylor and other Black women, and “I Can’t Breathe,” in reference to Eric Garner’s and Floyd’s final words, were printed on the backs of NBA players’ jerseys. The names of Black men and women who were killed and other sayings like these were pasted on the backs of NFL players’ helmets.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAll of the sayings on the jerseys and helmets had to be approved by the respective leagues before being used.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFootball fields and basketball courts have also been fitted with statements voicing support for the Black Lives Matter movement, emphasizing that change will take the whole country.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While Blair athletes might not have gone so far as refusing to play, senior varsity basketball player Jacob Briggs knows that they would have still protested this year had there not been a pandemic. Despite the consequences for missing practice and school, Briggs thinks they also would have attended all the protests outside of school. “Even during all the punishments we got for protesting last year [in DC], we still went as a team to support each other and what was being fought for,” he says. Players who skipped school to protest were forced by the coach to run during following practices.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Is this activism simply performative?</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tSimilar to the changing of the Washington Football Team name, much of this activism has faced criticism. Other than the sizable monetary donations, some motions by the league have been characterized as too little, too late. Many fans are asking why it took so long for the sports leagues to finally make these changes—many of which do not feel as if they are truly the changes that are needed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tRoger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, released a video in which he said that the NFL “was wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier,” even as players like Colin Kaepernick, who used their platform to protest, are still unsigned and exiled from the league.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDuring the first weekend of games, the NFL showed a video of Alicia Keys singing “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” In this video, Kaepernick is prominently featured along with many other NFL stars kneeling for the song. Kaepernick tweeted, seemingly in response, “While the NFL runs propaganda about how they care about Black Life, they are still actively blackballing Eric Reid for fighting for the Black community.” Kaepernick’s comments reference NFL player Eric Reid, who filed a collusion lawsuit in 2018 accusing the NFL of preventing his employment because of his protest activity. Other athletes agree with Kaepernick, with Reid even calling the video “diabolical,” according to ESPN.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLike the Green Bay Packers, the Miami Dolphins also released a public video about why their team chose to remain in the locker room; the statement featured many of their players criticizing the NFL and their “empty gestures.”</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Why now?</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAll of this change begs the question of why these sports leagues chose to start supporting these protests now. The NBA has long tried to make itself appear to be the most progressive of sports leagues, with the commissioner choosing not to enforce rules against social activism on the athletes, but the NFL has held their position against protestors for many years.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tKaepernick kneeled in 2016, Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013, and people have protested the old Washington Football Team name since 1972. So why did it take until 2020 for the NFL to respond to continuous criticism?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tSimply put: money. The NFL is finding itself in a precarious position with younger viewers. In 2017, just 27 percent of Millennials said that they were committed to watching football games, a huge drop from the 36 percent of Generation X-ers, according to a survey done by McKinsey and Company. That same survey did not find the same gap in generational viewership in the NBA, an organization known for being more progressive.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAn NFL-sponsored poll in 2018 found that a majority of African-American, Latinx, and millennial viewers did not support disciplining players who kneeled. Racial tensions have only mounted since then. With growing pressure from all around, the NFL was pushed to support the Black Lives Matter movement and players’ peaceful protests at games.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBriggs concurs that athletic leagues, including the NBA, do not actually care about the Black Lives Matter movement, but rather the money. “It's a business and the majority of their money comes from minorities, so if minorities aren't [supporting them], then they don’t have a source of income,” he says. “Allowing players to skip games or change their jersey names—I feel like it’s a whole scam to keep the money flowing.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWhile major sports leagues, especially the NFL, seem to have made some changes for the better, they were forced into a similar situation as the Washington Football Team: reform or risk losing money and relevancy. The NFL chose money.</span></p>	33268
32243	The sensitivity of mass shootings renders the new lockdown largely ineffective	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">School shootings across the nation have resulted in national student-led walkouts, strikes and calls for policy reform. In an effort to educate students on what to do in a shooting and keep them safe, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) implemented new active shooter drills, formally called “lockdown with options,” this year. However, the unforeseen nature of shootings, coupled with the sensitivity of the topic, causes any type of shooter drill to be futile.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32242"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The </span><a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmmain.aspx?pid=billpage&amp;tab=subject3&amp;id=sb1265&amp;stab=01&amp;ys=2018rs" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Maryland Safe to Learn Act</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, which Gov. Larry Hogan signed into law in April 2018, spurred these drills into action. While the bill does not mandate shooter drills, MCPS moved forward with the drills to </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Active-Shooter-Drills-Start-in-Montgomery-County-Public-Schools-562450631.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">get ahead</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> of the curve. MCPS is not alone—according to the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/09/07/why-schools-should-end-active-shooter-drills-immediately/#dd5b27a2a928" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Washington Post</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, the school security services is an industry now worth three billion dollars.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The new “lockdown with options” gives students three choices: Avoid, Defend or Deny (ADD). "Avoid" is for classrooms near exits, where students can escape and run away. "Deny" is the traditional lockdown procedure in addition to barricading the door. "Defend," the last resort, is to fight the gunman.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Unlike other counties in the nation, MCPS does not simulate real gunshots or fire blanks in the hallway. “Loud noises like gunshots are not good for kids with anxiety. Anybody would be scared enough as it is. You will not see anything like that in MCPS drills,” Blair security assistant Brian Leatherwood says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The unpredictability of shootings contributes to the drills' ineffectiveness. The best the county can do is to describe how students should act in various scenarios. The ADD response is also flawed because it relies on the fact that students know the gunman's location. As opposed to security who can communicate through walkie-talkies, students are completely blind to the assailant from their classroom and have no guarantee of making the correct choice.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even if students know the gunman's location, drills are unable to prepare them for every possible scenario. “It could be in the beginning of the school day when everyone is in the cafeteria or not in class. So then what do you do? It’s hard, because we do not really have any answers for that,” Blair School Resource Officer Sharese Junious says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Additionally, all logical reasoning will go out the window in the state of an actual shooting. “Nobody is going to remember what we learned in those PowerPoints if an actual event occurs. Everyone is just going to panic, and everything will be in chaos anyways,” junior Dana Graham says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The sheer number of mass shootings that have happened in the past also puts school systems in a worse position. As of Sept. 1, there have been </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mass-shootings-2019-more-mass-shootings-than-days-so-far-this-year/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">283 mass shootings</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in America. Gunmen usually learn from past school shooters, so they know what kind of instructions schools give their students. “Copycats learn from previous instances. They know kids will run, and sometimes they will have exits blocked or covered,” Leatherwood says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though the new active shooter drills are ineffective in preparing students for a school shooting, they do succeed in sparking an important conversation. Before MCPS introduced “lockdown with options,” the county lacked a conversation about active assailant situations. At the very least, these new drills expose students to the potential courses of action they can take in the event of an actual shooting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The key to keeping the school safe is to stay alert and report any suspicious findings. “Do not open the door for anyone you personally do not know. Report anything that seems off to us, because you guys know the school better than the police do,” Junious concludes. School shootings are scary, and active shooter drills are unequipped to simulate a real shooting scenario. Thus, it is always necessary to stay vigilant and listen to the advice from the county.&nbsp;</span></p>	32242
32960	Test centers implement extra protocols to adhere to social distancing guidelines	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sept. 26 and Oct. 3, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) held its first set of SAT administrations following a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The earlier Aug. 29 cancellation in MCPS caused many students to drive long distances and test in different counties within Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Upcoming SAT dates include Nov. 7 and Dec. 5. Students who are already registered should regularly check their College Board accounts for test center updates including </span><a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/test-center-closings" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); background-color: transparent;">closure</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, relocation or cancellation due to limited capacity. More guidelines for MCPS test centers (arrival information, parking, entrances, etc.) can be found </span><a href="https://news.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/quicknotes/update-on-sat-act-administration-for-mcps-students/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); background-color: transparent;">here</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> or on their individual websites.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Aside from normal testing requirements, the College Board issued a series of additional coronavirus-related protocols that must be followed on test day. This includes requiring masks for the duration of testing, limiting testing rooms to 10 students, and asking that students arrive 15 to 30 minutes earlier than the normal 7:45 a.m. to 8 a.m. window. The early arrival request will allow time for test takers to complete a COVID-19 safety screening — a process where students verbally respond to a series of </span><a href="https://pages.collegeboard.org/sat-covid-19-updates#screening" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); background-color: transparent;">statements</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> about potential exposure — before being permitted to enter the building.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32959"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Any individual who violates these requirements, in addition to any extra guidelines implemented by their test site, will be dismissed by their test center and their test scores will be cancelled without refund. However, students who feel ill on test day are encouraged to stay home; registrations can be transferred to another test date at no charge or cancelled with full refund through Dec. 31 for this reason.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At this time, the SAT is the only large national test administration offered in MCPS. The county is only administering the ACT to students with previously approved accommodations. “This small group testing will take place during the approved October special testing window. Parents of students with approved accommodations for special testing should contact the counseling department at their child’s school to make arrangements with the testing coordinator for testing to take place outside of the school day,” MCPS said in a </span><a href="https://news.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/quicknotes/update-on-sat-act-administration-for-mcps-students/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">statement</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> released on Sept. 17. There are no further updates from MCPS on when ACT testing will return in an increased capacity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a result of continued standardized testing uncertainty, colleges have updated their requirements for the 2021 admissions cycle. Most schools have increased flexibility by extending score deadlines, reviewing applicants with or without test scores equally and understanding that applicants may not have had multiple testing opportunities (typically results in a higher score). A list of colleges with test optional policies can be found </span><a href="https://www.insight-education.net/list-test-optional-colleges-2021/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); background-color: transparent;">here</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.

31803	Blazers attended a Q&A session with SMOB candidates Zoe Tishaev and Nate Tinbite	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Thursday, April 11, the Student Government Association (SGA) hosted a town hall with the two Student Member of the Board (SMOB) candidates, Zoe Tishaev and Nate Tinbite, in the auditorium. Held during both 5th and 6th period lunch, the event allowed Blazers to ask the candidates questions about their campaigns and policies.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">SGA parliamentarian Swechchha Shrestha kicked off the town hall by asking the candidates to introduce their policy platforms.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Tishaev is a junior at Clarksburg High School who became involved in student government late in her freshman year.

Tinbite's policies focus on closing the opportunity gap, breaking socioeconomic barriers and amplifying student voices.

32361	The film is a familiar roller coaster detective story with a unique twist.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The entertainment industry has seen its fair share of whodunnit stories, but none have been quite like “Knives Out.” The original flick, directed by Rian Johnson, spins a cookie-cutter detective story into a much more complex and chaotic tale.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Knives Out” tracks the events that unfold after mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead following his 85th birthday from the perspective of his caregiver and close friend, Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas). From the anonymous hiring of Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to tension in the dysfunctional Thrombey family, the story twists and turns until audiences come face to face with the realization that this is no normal whodunnit.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The stellar casting for the Thrombey family captures the stereotypical conflicts that many of us run into at the Thanksgiving dinner table. With the loss of their patriarch, the downward spiral of souring relationships between the characters is not only entertaining, but also an incredibly clever way to unwind alibis and reveal the plethora of hidden motives to keep viewers guessing.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32357"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Similar to Johnny Depp’s legendary first outing as Jack Sparrow, Craig’s portrayal of the southern Detective Blanc cuts through the story's tension while piecing together crucial information for viewers. His character carefully walks the line between humor and wit, and stands out against the sea of dreary and unrealistic investigators in the detective genre</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chris Evans’ ability to shift from arrogant to understanding as Hugh Ransom Drysdale, the deemed “Black Sheep” of the Thrombey family, brings a surprising and chilling performance. His character’s indifference to his family’s opinions creates entertaining encounters with Blanc and Marta.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This film would not be successful without its simple yet complex setting. Taking place in a puzzle-like mansion filled with trinkets and unique mysterious decorations, “Knives Out” doesn’t require Blockbuster CGI or special effects to create an ominous and mysterious ambiance.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Reminiscent of classic detective film music, composer Nathan Johnson's track slices between scenes and is the perfect accompaniment for the film’s somewhat humorous tone and peculiar environment.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Knives Out” is a unique film that pays respect to traditional detective stories written by Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle, tackling the complex process of reaching the truth. With a perfect balance between humor, action, and mystery, it is a must-see original flick.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Knives Out” is rated PG-13 for brief violence, some strong language, sexual references and drug material and is now playing at Regal Majestic, AMC 18 Arclight Bethesda, and AMC Wheaton.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32357

33176	Many who wear the popular glasses fall into a false reality.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As Leigh Tinsley stared into her Chromebook, grading her student’s work, she began to feel a shooting pain in her eyes and a throbbing headache that seemed to distort the world around her. Worried about her health, she contacted her doctor, who recommended that she buy blue light glasses to alleviate some of her symptoms. Though aware of the skepticism surrounding the effectiveness of these glasses, Tinsley still bought them and feels that her issues have been relieved.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tTinsley, a Blair English teacher, is not the only one who has experienced eye pain and headaches from screen usage and opted to buy blue light glasses. With digital technology becoming increasingly intertwined with people’s lives and COVID-19 forcing nationwide shutdowns and remote learning realities, more and more people are spending time in front of screens. Consequently, they are exposing themselves to blue light, which can be harmful to an individual’s health in excess.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tNicholas Losekamp, a psychology teacher at Blair, said that the issue is due to a lack of blinking when staring at screens. “When you focus on something, you don't blink. If you're not blinking, you're not lubricating your eyes,” he said. “If you do that for a long period of time, it's going to cause eye strain,” he explained.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33174"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, according to VeryWellHealth, an award-winning online resource with information on up-to-date health topics, while not a causing factor, there is evidence that greater exposure to blue light can increase the risk of macular degeneration—a disease that severely impairs eyesight.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBut the damage caused by blue light goes beyond an individual’s vision.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAs a result, blue light glasses have emerged as a popular option as they are said to solve these health issues, thus allowing people to continue the on-screen activities they enjoy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tTo those who have never owned glasses before, wearing blue light glasses is a different experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tCruz Portillo-Castillo, a senior at Northwood, bought blue light glasses last December to resolve the eye strain and sleeping difficulties he experienced after playing on his Nintendo Switch gaming console. Portillo-Castillo noticed that his surroundings were different when he wore his glasses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;“Everything [around me] had a different color to it,” he said. “Sometimes white would have a more yellowish tint to it.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tPortillo-Castillo said the glasses didn’t change the way he saw himself, and he didn’t feel it changed the way others perceived him. “Not at all,” he said. “[I just noticed] being able to see better, less eye strain, [and] being able to sleep better.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tSimilarly, Kenny Menelas, a junior at Takoma Academy, also bought blue light glasses because of eye strain resulting from digital use and used them so much that he forgot to put his glasses in his case before playing and resting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t“The glasses are attached to me like peanut butter and jelly,” he wrote in an email. “[One time] I forgot to remove the glasses from my face when I was playing basketball with my friends. My friends laughed at me and called me careless, but I [didn’t notice].”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAlthough Portillo-Castillo, Menelas, and many others agree that blue light glasses helped alleviate the eye strain and headaches caused by using digital devices, according to scientific research, these glasses do not do that.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tA 2017 study by Wiley Online Library investigated whether utilizing blue light glasses reduces eye strain, and researchers didn’t find evidence that supported the commonly held belief.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe researchers measured subjects’ symptoms of eye strain on a five-point scale over the course of a month of wearing either high-blue-blocking or non-blue-blocking glasses. They couldn’t find a noticeable difference between the two groups.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">\tLosekamp stated that people’s issues may feel resolved when wearing these glasses because of the placebo effect</span><span style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">—a psychological phenomenon where someone thinks they are cured of an issue despite engaging in a treatment without therapeutic value. “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The glasses don’t help you,” he said. “But the belief that they do makes them work.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOther solutions that can ease eye strains like the 20-20-20 rule, which suggests that every 20 minutes, a person should look at something different 20 feet away from them for 20 seconds. This helps to relax your eyes and encourages blinking. Furthermore, using eye drops can help lubricate your eyes if they become dry.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAt the end of the day, whatever the method a person chooses to alleviate the symptoms of staring at a screen all day––whether it be wearing blue light glasses or utilizing strategies like the 20-20-20 rule––striving to protect one’s health is all that matters.</span></p>	33174
33159	Kathryn is Silver Chips' Ombudsman. To connect with her, email ombudsmansilverchips@gmail.com.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many of us have experienced teachers who interact with us digitally in a way that feels like an invasion of our privacy. Some teachers follow us from personal accounts or retweet our personal posts without asking; others comment on student social media content that is unrelated to school.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 2015, a former Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School principal personally followed back many of her students on Twitter. Despite the fact that she believed it would bridge the gap between student and teacher, she faced significant blowback from her students. There’s a reason why that gap exists. There should be a difference in how we interact with our teachers versus how we interact with our friends and family.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When teachers and administrators communicate personally with students through social media, the nature of those exchanges can oftentimes put students in uncomfortable positions. How would it look if we blocked our teachers who interacted with us on social media? This action could effect how they view us as students and maybe, some students feel, even change how they grade our papers and tests.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33158"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A teacher’s presence on social media also puts them in a difficult position. There is a fine line between announcing a fundraiser or a scholarship opportunity and snooping on students or asking why they haven’t turned in a particular assignment. Any engagement on social media that crosses that line of direct teacher-student communication is an overstep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The MCPS policy on social media is theoretically clear. In their “Best Practices for Employees” guide, they offer recommendations on how staff members should conduct themselves on social media, including not doing anything that signals they are “friends” with a student and having separate accounts for “professional” and “personal” matters. The document also explains, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS employees posting to social media in a professional capacity should not block users or delete comments on their own initiative.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Our own principal, Renay Johnson, is known for her active social media presence on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook. Principal Johnson’s Twitter, especially, is popular among staff and parents, as she often posts resources for students and advertises various sporting events and academic opportunities in the Blair community. And yet, despite—or perhaps because of—her significant following and support, her accounts have recently sparked uncomfortable tension.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Over the summer, a number of students took to social media with criticism of the Blair administration, and MCPS regarding the treatment of sexual harassment allegations and the culture of sexual harassment, assault, and abuse in our schools. Some of these students’ Twitter accounts were later blocked by Principal Johnson.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I spoke with Principal Johnson, and she said that she felt the tweets were “personal attacks.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“When… it crosses the line from being, ‘we don't block anyone,’ to bullying and harassment and intimidation,” she said, “you have the right to block people.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some of the tweets were racist, misogynistic, and derogatory. One person sent out a racial slur underneath a post from Principal Johnson about new portables at Blair, another brought her salary into question, and someone else used the word “clown” to describe the principal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">These comments crossed the line. Our principal should not have to face bigoted criticism, and she had every right to block those students. Just like our peers who were speaking out against abuse, Principal Johnson should be allowed to protect herself from harassment and bullying. But it was unnecessary for her to block students that were simply being critical of the administration.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whatever Principal Johnson’s response was to individual students, blocking students who spoke out made it feel as if we were being punished for criticizing administration.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to Principal Johnson, any statement that she makes regarding topics such as sexual assault, rape, or violence must be approved by MCPS before it is released. But she now recognizes she could have made a neutral comment addressing the situation: “In retrospect, I could have said, ‘Hi Blazers, I understand your concern about sexual assault in our school; [there’s] a police investigation.’”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If Principal Johnson had released this statement through Twitter, or in a newsletter at the time, I think many of us would have felt much more secure and safe knowing that the school was taking action to protect their students.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The best way to mitigate MCPS employees having to handle criticism from students on social media would be to remove names attached to the accounts. Instead of having a “Blair Principal” Twitter or Instagram, administration could simply have an account for Montgomery Blair High School. This way, students could voice concerns without crossing the line into personal attacks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The county must also seriously revise its teacher-student “Best Practices for Employees” guide. A web-page of recommendations is simply not enough. Employees need clear rules and clear ramifications of the penalties for breaking these rules. Students need to also understand that using racist language against someone that they are upset with is not acceptable. Oftentimes, it can have the opposite of the intended effect.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The incident this summer with Principal Johnson and other Blair staff lay bare that the MCPS social media policy is weak and ineffective. For years, interactions between teachers and their students on social media have gone virtually unchecked. It should not be our responsibility as students to tattle on teachers for breaking these guidelines. MCPS must step up now and recognize that this is a growing issue of concern—one that will get much more complex as new social media platforms gain prominence and the county shifts toward more digital learning opportunities.</span></p>	33158
31999	Something's keeping student musicians at home, and it's not the sweltering summer heat	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair junior Shariar Vaez-Ghaemi wipes his brow and sets his clarinet down beside him. He purses his lips and debates whether or not to keep practicing, lest he burn out the week before the audition. Junior Maxwell Zhang wearily rubs his fingertips that have hardened to calluses courtesy of his viola. All over the county, young musicians are voluntarily confined to their homes, passing up hanging out with friends to grind for what's approaching.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every student in Montgomery County is gearing up for back-to-school season, but musicians know these final weeks by another name: audition season.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31998"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fall orchestra and band auditions are usually comprised of scales, orchestral excerpt, solo repertoire and sight reading components. Well-known local youth groups include Potomac Valley Youth Orchestra (PVYO) and Maryland Classic Youth Orchestra (MCYO), which both have a hierarchy of ensembles for students from 2nd grade to 12th grade.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For many, audition season is a time of stress, competition and labor. Musicians might practice for hours each day, only to freeze up in front of the judges. Each player feels the gravity of the potential mistakes, reliving the painful memories of a slipped finger or rough transition. Zhang, who has years of auditions under his belt, has experienced these effects firsthand. "I didn't make All State in freshman year because I dropped my bow during a staccato excerpt in my audition," he says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Their worries are, without a doubt, justified. Fall auditions hold a tremendous weight— how they perform during those 15 minutes determines where they will rehearse a few hours each week for the rest of the year. Will they be in an ensemble with their friends? Or left behind in a lower level?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the toughest aspects of playing an audition is feeling the judge's presence. To combat this spotlight panic, musicians create opportunities to simulate audition circumstances. They play for teachers, friends, family and even stuffed animals.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Vaez-Ghaemi and junior Chris Tong both plan to audition for PVYO on the clarinet in the coming weeks. Contrary to the many anxious players, Vaez-Ghaemi recognizes the mind game of auditions and refuses to fall back into unease. "I've realized that the last few weeks of audition season, and even the events leading up to the audition, are out of my control," he says. "Everyone overthinks it and tries to predict how the judges will interpret their music."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Tong, too, has grown comfortable with the nature of auditions. "</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I just try to think of it as playing music for someone else," Tong says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whether it be eating a banana an hour before the audition, drinking chamomile tea to calm their nerves or wearing a good luck charm, most musicians have their personal pre-audition routines. "I wear my turquoise tie," Vaez-Ghaemi says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Routines aside, the warm-up room is essential to get in the zone before performing. "</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I warm up for a pretty substantial amount of time before my audition, which I think helps me a lot," Tong says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Audition season has its upsides, but it also has its downsides. "I like most that I have a chance to show what I’ve done all summer," Vaez-Ghaemi says. "I like least that I have to compete with my friends." Despite the inevitable competition that arises, friends still find ways to collaborate, perhaps conducting practice auditions over a video call or rehearsing excerpts together.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Vaez-Ghaemi keeps the core of auditions in mind to remain focused and calm. "Really, auditions are very simple: just prepare a piece, play it, and walk out," he says. It's crucial to ultimately remember that those brief moments inside the room are judged subjectively, and musicians will enjoy the upcoming school year regardless of the results.</span></p>	31998
32522	The Blazers win 70-47 against the Cougars	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair boys' varsity basketball team (5-1) defeated the Quince Orchard Cougars (5-2) by a score of 70-47 in their third home game of the season on Monday night. The game, originally scheduled for Dec. 16, was moved to Jan. 6.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The beginning of the first quarter was tight as Blair and Quince Orchard traded buckets, leaving the score 6-6. During the latter half, senior forward Bakarr Bangura made five field goals with assists from junior guards Roman Cannuscio, Jacob Briggs and Michael Ayala, contributing 10 points to the team. The most impressive moment of the first quarter, and arguably the entire game, happened in the last second of the quarter when Cannuscio took a shot from the midcourt line and made a three-pointer. At the end of the first quarter, Blair was ahead of the game, 23-10.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32521"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With the Blazers starting off the second quarter with more than double their score, the Cougars attempted a comeback. The Cougars were able to close the gap to 7 points, bringing the score to 28-21. However, within a matter of minutes, Cannuscio and junior guard Alfred Worrell scored a series of three-pointers and free-throws. The second quarter ended 43-28.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both the coach and the players agreed that Blazers started off strong and played well. "I think we played really well as a team," Cannusio said. "We came out strong in the first quarter and we really extended the lead and put them away early. We were able to get things going early and keep the momentum."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Through the third quarter, Quince Orchard lagged behind even more as they struggled to keep up with the Blazers. Worrell, senior guard Liam Olagbaju, Ayala, Cannuscio and senior center Leon Johnson made shots, keeping Blair in the lead. The gap between the teams' scores peaked at the end of this quarter, which ended with a score of 63-38.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">By the start of the last quarter, it was almost certain that the Blazers would take home a victory. Although the Blazers slowed a little, scoring only seven points in the quarter, the boys ended the game with a solid 70-47 victory.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Coach Damon Pigrom said that the team played well together and that the players trusted each other. "I thought it was a very good team effort," Pigrom said. "We shared the ball. We defended and we were able to win." Pigrom, however, did point out that the team needed to work on consistency. "The main thing is probably being more consistent about playing as a team," Pigrom said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Thursday, Jan. 9 against Sherwood at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	32521
32393	Are the new AirPod Pros worth it?	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Sorry, I can’t hear you I have AirPods in.” Ever since their original release in 2016, AirPods have become a cultural phenomenon: in every crowd, someone is bound to be using them. Bluetooth and wireless headphones have existed for years, but these small and portable white earpieces easily one-up every similar product on the market.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Oct. 30, Apple released the AirPod Pros, the newest version of the popular earbuds. The public’s reaction was mixed, with the most common responses related to the product’s expensive price ($249), revamped design and added features. Critics went as far as claiming that the AirPod Pros can generate enough radiation to cause cancer among users.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32392"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">AirPods are universally acclaimed. Yet, some of the characteristics of AirPod Pros, most notably the price, are offsetting. Here is a look at several key aspects of the AirPod Pros so you can determine for yourself if they are worth the splurge.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Features</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">The first version of AirPods were wireless Bluetooth earbuds. In addition to playing audio, AirPods feature a built-in microphone. This filters out background noise and allows users to take phone calls and talk to Siri, Apple’s assistant.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">The AirPods’ built-in accelerometers and optical sensors can detect </span><a href="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/10/AirPods-Pro-comparison-AirPods-gen-2-controls.png" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">taps</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;"> (e.g. double-tap to pause audio or skip track) and in-ear placement, which enables users to easily pause their music by taking out the one or both earbuds. The music automatically resumes when they are put back in.</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">The AirPod Pros include these favorite features as well as several exciting additions. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">AirPod Pros boast active </span><a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/.a/6a0120a5580826970c0240a4e589dd200b-600wi" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">noise cancellation</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, which creates an immersive sonic experience. However, this is coupled with users having the option to activate “transparency mode” if they want to be tuned in to their real-world surroundings as well.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Apple also refined the ergonomics of their headphones, implementing a </span><a href="https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/10/airpods-pro-airpods-compare-ear-tips.png" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">customizable fit</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in the AirPod Pros. There are three sizes of the flexible silicone tips—small, medium, and large—that click into the base of the AirPod and conform to the user’s ear shape in order to keep the AirPod secure. Additionally, there are vents helping equalize pressure, so users feel almost as if there is nothing in their ears at all.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One slight downside to these improvements is a shorter battery life. The AirPods deliver up to five hours of battery life, with another 19 hours added by the charging case. Due to the noise cancelling feature, the AirPods Pros claim a little less – 4.5 hours – plus the same 19 hours from the charging case. Compared to other earbuds which offer 8-10 hours of life without charging, this is upsetting.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Price</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The first-generation AirPods cost approximately $140, but the AirPod Pros hit the market at $249. This drastic price jump makes the newest generation of Apple earbuds far less accessible and potentially not worth the price.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Eric Feng, an AirPods user, says the AirPod Pros’ price offsets the chance that he will upgrade, but it could be worth it for long-term use. “The AirPods Pros are $249 which is a bump up from $160 but I think that people will get their money’s worth if they keep them for two or three years,” Feng says.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Style</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Style is the one aspect Apple has not mastered with their AirPods. With the first generation’s release, critics stated that Apple got lazy and simply just cut the wires off of their classic earphones.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The AirPod Pros also have yielded a plethora of memes regarding their similar appearance to other comical items. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">They look stupid. They look like blow dryers,</span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">” </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">sophomore Dulce Vasquez says. They’ve also been compared to the peashooters from Plants vs. Zombies, Snoopy, seahorses, Birdo, Mario, Pingu, Bellsprout from Pokemon and so much more. Efforts to revamp design seem to be lackluster on the whole.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Radiation</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">The primary concern that potential users have about AirPod Pros is that their placement in the ear canal exposes tissues in the head to high levels of radiofrequency radiation. Extremists </span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6796679/Are-AirPods-dangerous-250-scientists-warn-be.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">cite studies</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;"> stating that when animals were exposed to this form of radiation, they had increased reproductive, neurological and genetic damage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">The flaw with this idea is that AirPods alone expose us to radiation. Radiation is everywhere. The only way to stay protected is to distance yourself from technology altogether, which is impossible in this day and age.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">In actuality, there's really no evidence that radio-frequency (RF) radiation can cause brain cancer or tumors in humans. In fact, as stated by the </span><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/EHIB/CDPH%20document%20Library/Cell-Phone-Guidance.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">California Department of Public Health</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">, holding a cell phone to your face emits more RF energy than Bluetooth devices like AirPods.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All in all, AirPods are worth it. The sleek earbuds are on trend for any occasion. However, the necessity to blast through your savings to buy AirPod Pros is up to individual debate. The struggle is no doubt deciding for yourself whether the advanced features are truly worth the dramatic price.</span></p>	32392
31963	After knocking out France in the quarterfinal, there was no real competition left for the Americans.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On July 7, the United States defeated the Netherlands 2-0 in the final of the 2019 Women's World Cup at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais, located in Décines-Charpieu, France. But the United States' second consecutive World Cup championship was won long before co-captain Megan Rapinoe's game-winning penalty kick in the 61st minute of the final. It was decided before the final, even before the semi-final. The United States practically guaranteed another World Cup win when they beat France 2-1 in the quarterfinal.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Coming into the tournament, the U.S. and France were the favorites. The Americans, the defending champions, were ranked number one in the world according to the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA), and France had the home team advantage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Both teams won their groups handily and looked strong going into the knockout stage. However, due to the layout of the World Cup's bracket, France and the U.S., arguably the two strongest teams in the group stage, were set to meet in the quarterfinal.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the first round of the knockout stage, the U.S. faced Spain, who proved to be more worthy opponents than many were expecting them to be. But the Americans pulled through with a 2-1 victory. France faced a tough Brazilian side, but also won with a score of 2-1. At this point, both teams were preparing for their next match, which would be against each other in a few days time.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The highly-anticipated quarterfinal started out with a bang, with Rapinoe slipping the ball behind French goalie Sarah Bouhaddi in the fifth minute on a free kick. Although both sides continued to make solid offensive runs, the score held for the rest of the first half, and for the first twenty minutes of the second half until Rapinoe scored again in the 65th minute off of a well-placed pass from Tobin Heath.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31962"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The U.S. almost went up by three, which would have created a deficit that would have been nearly impossible for France to recover from, but Heath was called offside after scoring on Bouhaddi in the 75th minute.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">France then began to make a comeback, with a header from Wendie Renard to close the gap to a one-goal game in the 81st minute. Unfortunately for France, there was too little time left for them to tie it up, and the United States advanced, knocking out the home team in the process.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">France lost, despite the fact that they had maintained possession for the majority of the game, had completed more passes and had taken more shots. Perhaps they could have pulled away with the win if they had taken advantage of the weaknesses in the American side that Spain had exposed.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For the rest of their World Cup run, the U.S. didn't have to face a team of the same caliber as the French side. It was an extremely close game against England, but the United States kept the possession game and number of passes completed much closer, and took more shots.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Netherlands were the "dark horse" of the tournament. Most people didn't expect them to go as far as they had. They played well in the final, but the Americans still beat them without much difficulty.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The win came at a critical time for the U.S. Women’s National Team, given the court case they filed earlier this year against the U.S. Soccer Federation on the basis of unequal treatment to the men’s team despite better performances.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It will also be interesting to see whether or not the team actually sticks to Rapinoe’s claim that they won’t be going to the White House if invited by President Trump, due to the team’s disagreements with several of his policies.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sometimes, that's just how things work out. Due to the set-up of the World Cup, it isn't always the best two teams that end up in the final, as was the case this year, when the best two teams met in the quarterfinal.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31961
32356	How the Silver Spring Methodist Church’s food distribution program operates	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Silver Spring Methodist Church, located across the street from Blair, has been distributing food in partnership with the Manna Food Center for the past few years every second and fourth Saturday. Along with food distribution, the church also hosts cooking classes under Manna's "Chat and Chew" program to help people learn to cook the food received from the pantry.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32355"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The "Chat and Chew" program runs for an hour before the food distribution, giving those registered with Manna a chance to learn how to cook with the food they receive. "We're trying to showcase recipes that highlight some of the ingredients that people might be receiving at the pantry that day," Manna Director of Programs Jenna Umbraic says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Manna’s Community Food Education Program manager, Cynthia Wilson, is in charge of the curriculum the cooking lessons follow. The lessons typically focus on a specific ingredient, exploring its health benefits and cooking a dish. While Wilson does head the conversation on what is being cooked, volunteers working at her side also discuss the dish with those watching the lessons. "It's good to have someone else chime in on something, to bring it down so that people can understand it and walk away with it," Wilson says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Class sizes are small, typically not exceeding more than eight members. This allows for Manna staff to get to know participants and have honest dialogue. "We are definitely talking about the recipe, but we also want to establish a bond with you…with a smaller group, you develop a better rapport and they're more comfortable asking questions," Wilson says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32354"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Building up this connection, Manna members often ask what those taking the cooking class would like to learn during the next food distribution. “We have folks that come out to meetings, and we'll ask them 'What is it you would like to learn? What recipes would you like?'" Wilson explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While Manna has other food education programs, the "Chat and Chew" program at Silver Spring Methodist Church is the only program like it in the area, due to the church’s licensed kitchen space. "We've had community food education for a few years now, in different shapes and forms. This is just an extension of that, and allows us to use this asset of the kitchen and combine it really nicely with the pantry that's happening that day," Umbraic explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Umbraic hopes to inspire those involved in the cooking lessons to continue to make healthy meals. "Hopefully, this is a chance for people to see those foods being prepared and to taste them and then get excited about trying them on their own," Umbraic says. The Manna pantry program at Silver Spring Methodist church ran for the past few years, and Manna workers look forward to continuing this food distribution program along with the new"Chat and Chew" program in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>	32354
32153	After graduation, Blair students are not confined to just one career pathway.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For most students at Blair, the college admissions process begins as early as middle school. Varsity sports athletes, club presidents and protege musicians simultaneously try to check all the boxes for a padded resume.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Parental and peer pressure attaches a negative stigma with not having a college degree. However, it must be made clear to students that a full-time four year college program is not the only pathway to success. The alternatives to college may provide even greater opportunities and avenues for growth: vocational training and job offerings are just some of the exceptional post-high school activities available to Blazers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In fact, according to</span><a href="https://mbhs.edu/departments/counseling/BlairProfile.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"> Blair’s Class of 2020 Profile</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, only 60 percent of the 2019 seniors went on to attend a four year college. 32 percent went on to two year college and 8 percent pursued other post-high school activities. Want to know what the other 8 percent did instead?&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jorge Ventura, Senior</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair fosters a program which allows students to attend Thomas Edison High School for half of the school day. Edison is a free vocational and technical school. Courses range from carpentry to health professions to cosmetology.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair senior Jorge Ventura proves that not all successful students have to attend college. Ventura participates in Edison’s plumbing course in the construction cluster. He has already earned his plumbing certification and is getting job offers from the US government and </span><a href="https://www.local5plumbers.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Plumbers &amp; Gasfitters Local 5 Union Hall</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers who go through the Edison programs make up a substantial portion of seniors who decide to pursue their careers instead of attending college. Blair counselor Ms. Belvey Russ notes that by the end of high school, seniors are getting job offers in their respective fields and certifications to enter into the workforce. “They’ve added some new programs like cybersecurity, and students are getting network operations experience and job offers out of that program,” Russ says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ventura is currently working part-time at the Local 5 Union Hall, a job which Edison has readily prepared him for. “I’ve learned how you vent, how to backflow, how to install a water heater and blueprints as an apprentice,” Ventura says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32152"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After graduation, he plans to continue working in the plumbing industry instead of taking courses at a college. “I tried to study a book before, but I find that I really like to do hands on stuff instead. Besides, the union is commercial and residential. My body and mindset is already comfortable with this plumbing job. I know how to interact with customers and solve problems myself,” Ventura concludes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ben Mourad, Class of ‘18</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">College is not just an educational opportunity; it is an immersing experience. Students are usually required to take classes in all subject areas. This may not be the best learning environment for everyone, especially those who are extremely passionate about one particular issue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair alumni Ben Mourad (Class of ‘18) expressed that while college is a great way to pursue ideas, he wanted the freedom to focus on one particular subject rather than be distracted by other school work. “</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I decided not to go to college because I had some ideas I wanted to pursue immediately. I was very interested in how to help people find common ground, and I wanted to see what I could do in my local community,” Mourad says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Straight out of high school, Mourad landed an internship at the Restorative Justice Unit in MCPS Central Office. “It has been an excellent way to find platforms for my ideas as well as put them to the test,” Mourad concludes.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Arqad Soendoro, Class of ‘16</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The price of attending university is another roadblock that steers students away from traditional education. Combined tuition fees lead families to spend up to $70,000 a year, according to </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/244041/most-expensive-colleges-in-the-us/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Statista</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Because of the financial burden, Blazers may also work part-time or transfer to the University of Maryland (UMD) after two years at Montgomery College (MC).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Alumni Arqad Soendoro (Class of ‘16) notes that he decided to work full time after high school in order to pay for MC. “I decided </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">to go to college part-time to afford everything, and I worked full-time at my uncles mechanic shop,” Soendoro says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Soendoro participates in the Maryland Transfer Advantage Program (MTAP). MTAP is a dual enrollment partnership between UMCP and MC. Students </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">complete their associate’s degree at MC while planning for a successful transfer to the UMCP to complete their bachelor’s degree. Thanks to funds saved up from his job, Soendoro can now transfer to UMD after the spring semester.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As seen by the rising demand in college education, students often plunge into a pre-college mindset, never considering the plethora of other opportunities available to them. Upperclassmen should discuss career ambitions and goals with their parents, counselors and teachers before making a decision about their future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Making a career choice is a big decision that shouldn’t be rushed. College isn’t for everyone, plain and simple.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32152

The leaders of the analysis to met with around 250 to 400 community members and discuss concerns about the future phases of the analysis.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s SAC capacity for the discussion was 475 seats, with around 300-350 of the expected attendees showing up for the analysis meeting. Community members were organized in tables of eight to help facilitate smaller-scale discussion along with WXY and Public Engagement Associates’ presentation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The presenters opened by preemptively addressing frequently asked questions about the boundary analysis. Kushan Dave, the representative for WXY, emphasized that the analysis was just a tool for county operations and repeatedly stated that it “did not make any recommendations for redistricting.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While many community members came to learn about the analysis, some came to verify and put rumors about the purpose of the study to rest. "I felt like it was important to come and get information directly from the source, so that when neighbors are bringing up moments of anxiety or expressing [concerns], I can say 'No, I was there, it’s not about that,'" MCPS parent Alison Gillespie stated.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Dave also stated that public discussion of the boundary analysis will give the Board valuable insight on the problems in the school system and add context to the data collected. "What we are really hoping to do is learn from the community and in a lot of ways, but the data only tells you so much. Through these meetings, we learn what things we should potentially be looking at and then add an objective report."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The event was structured by five main discussion sessions, where attendees would comment on sections of the analysis explained via a presentation from WXY and Public Engagement Associates. Community members discussed their own investments in MCPS, facility utilization, school diversity, school proximity reports and all four together in separate 10-minute sections with peers at their table.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32601"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Diversity aspects of the analysis raised pressing questions from the community. The leaders focused on the percentage of MCPS students who are or have been eligible for Free and Reduced Meals (Ever-FARMs) in each school to measure socioeconomic diversity. Many community members expressed concerns on whether this was a proper measure of diversity as it did not mention racial bias or other disadvantages students might have in the school system.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Public Engagement associate Steve Brigham stated that the next step in the boundary analysis is to reach out to students and other harder-to-reach populations. "There was a really strong emphasis on youth voices this meeting that we didn't hear [before] that we really need to respond to," Brigham said. Presenters explained that they were hoping to communicate with students through the Student Member of the Board, Nate Tinbite.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Leaders in the boundary analysis plan on reaching out to less represented communities in the near future. "Between this coming week and early to mid-Feb, we'll be doing about eight to 12 smaller meetings with different hard-to-reach populations," Brigham said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32601
32819	Missing out on the school or club seasons could mean a missed opportunity for most players	<p>One major result of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic is the indefinite suspension of the sports world. All American sports leagues have been suspended, the long-awaited March Madness tournament was cancelled, and most spring athletes didn't get to sport their colors at all this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The transition from practice every day and being prepared for games to having no practices or games to worry about has been difficult for many student athletes. "Going from a full season ahead of us to not even being able to practice was pretty shocking, and definitely has been a major let down," junior lacrosse player John Audet said.</p><p>Not just school teams have been affected, but also club teams. The club season is crucial to many high school players who are building their skill set and gaining more attention for college recruiting. Many athletes now fear that without this club season, they won't be able to play in college. "Junior year is where you’re mostly getting looks, but hopefully, if things get better, the time lost will be made up in summer programs for recruitment," Audet said.</p><p>Missing out on a whole club season will make it hard for athletes to show off their skills. "It definitely takes a huge hit to my recruitment process because without film and stats, there’s nothing I can really send out to these college coaches," junior soccer player Liben Schmidt&nbsp;commented.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32818"></div><p>Senior student athletes are missing out on their last season as a Blazer and senior night. "It felt like my official way of saying goodbye to my high school volleyball career and now that I can’t, it’s horrible," senior volleyball player Mizan Arum said with sorrow.</p><p>Teams with high expectations for the season have had their hopes crushed. "I definitely had high expectations with a lot of the players being experienced and the chemistry was great, not getting to play with my seniors for their final season is pretty crushing," Audet said.</p><p>The season's cancellation was also devastating due to the fact that most teams didn't even get to play a single game. "It’s really hard for me to accept the fact that I will never play in Blair’s court again," Arum added.</p><p>As it isn't completely known when the virus will calm down or go away, the cancellation or abbreviation of the fall season is a possibility. "It’ll just mess up everyone's hopes and personally I think it could ruin some talented athletes' chances of obtaining really good offers," Schmidt said .</p><p><em>On April 28, the Maryland Public Secondary School Athletic Association (MPSSAA) officially announced the cancellation of any remaining sporting events for the 2019-20 school year. The teams that remained in the boys' and girls' basketball state playoffs were all awarded state semifinalist titles for the season.</em></p>	32818
32413	Blazers beat Patriots 61-51	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair's Varsity Girls' Basketball team (2-0) beat the Wootton Patriots (1-1) by a score of 61-51 on Tuesday night, powering through their first home game of the season. Both teams had tactful performances, but the Blazers secured the victory with their superior passes, shots and defense.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The game began with junior captain and guard-forward Peyton Martin winning the tip-off. The Blazers lost possession of the ball and Wootton made a quick shot, opening the scoring at 2-0. However, the team remained unfazed, with junior guard Kate Hildebrandt evening the score to 2-2. Senior captain Lucy Martin followed in suit and quickly turned the score in Blair's favor. The Blazers continued to score points with remarkable teamwork and strong passes across the floor. Defense was strong with players constantly forcing Wootton out of bounds; Peyton Martin and senior guard Zoe Abramson successfully blocked several of Wootton’s shots. The quarter ended with a 3-point buzzer-beater by Peyton Martin, leaving Blair up 22-11.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32412"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The game became more intense in the second quarter, with the Patriots meeting the Blazers' initial attack with quick passes and strong defense. Throughout the quarter, sophomore guard Emily Liu dominated the court by closely guarding her opponents and making three baskets for Blair, including two 3-pointers. However, Blazers made multiple fouls, leading the Patriots to score points with free throws. The Patriots also scored a total of 13 points in the last minute of the quarter, tightening the score to 32-28 going into the half.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Freshman guard Amelia Martin detailed how Blair spirits were low during halftime. “We went through a big pep talk during halftime to bring our energy back up to the same level as theirs because basketball is all about our third quarter game and how we’re going to come back and seal the deal,” Amelia Martin said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The air was tense as the third quarter began, as Blair was determined to maintain their lead and Wootton strived to flip the score. Invigorated from pep-talks during the halftime break, both teams had a visible increase in spirit. Dramatic turnovers and fast breaks from both sides characterized the quarter, causing the ball to rapidly change hands and intensifying the competition. Freshman guard Natalie Frost and Abramson played strong throughout the quarter, scoring four points each. The Blazers worked to widen the gap on the scoreboard and succeeded, as the quarter ended 48-39.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The fourth quarter was heated. Wootton's center player continued to score, but the Blazers were able to counter her scores by continuing to make baskets for Blair. Both sides shot aggressively; Blair collectively scored 13 points, while Wootton scored 12. By establishing a comfortable lead in the third quarter, the Blazers prevented the Patriots from making a comeback. The Blazers successfully held on to the ball during the last minute of the match, ultimately securing their 61-51 victory.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After the game, Peyton Martin reflected on what the team should continue to work on as the season progresses. “Right now, making sure we’re always serious on defense. I think that sometimes, when we get ahead, we let off a bit,” she said, referring to the Patriots' comeback in the second quarter.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Coach Amy Ferguson was proud of the communication and determination the team exhibited throughout the game.&nbsp;“These girls never gave up and they were willing to move the ball and pass it to one another so, overall, a good win,” Ferguson said.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, December 13th against the Magruder Colonels at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	32412
31986	The superficial spinoff film doesn’t have much else in common with the rest of the franchise	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Step aside, Bonnie and Clyde… there’s a new dynamic duo in town. Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) prove that there is no situation they cannot get out of in “Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film starts by introducing a group of MI6 agents who are trying to take back Snowflake, a deadly virus that can be manipulated to kill millions of people, from terrorist organization Eteon. Brixton Lore (Idris Elba), a part-human, part-robot Eteon operative kills all the agents except Hattie Shaw (Vanessa Kirby) who escapes. Agents brief Hobbs and Shaw, Hattie's brother, about the missing virus and they then have to work together to track it down, much to their dismay.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since 2015’s Fast and Furious 7, Hobbs, an agent of America’s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) and Shaw, a former British elite operative, have hated each other with Hobbs even turning Shaw in. In this film, they finally come together, but miss no chance to try to look superior in comparison to the other.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From Los Angeles to London to Moscow to Samoa, this movie is truly larger than life. It is loaded with all the characteristics of a perfect action movie—high speed car chases, fist fights, unrealistic situations and constant humor.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Director David Leitch does a phenomenal job with his vision for this film. The stunts and camera work allow for some of the best vehicle and hand-to-hand action sequences viewers have ever seen.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hobbs and Shaw’s hilarious rivalry is the film’s crowning touch. The stark difference between them is evident from the start. Shown in split screen, Shaw is featured driving a sports car in rainy London while Hobbs zooms through sunny Los Angeles on his motorcycle. Their constant petty banter makes the movie unique. Not only are they up against the enemy, they are also up against one another.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31985"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, the movie falls short when compared to the rest of the “Fast and Furious” franchise, especially because of Vin Diesel and other integral cast members’ absence.&nbsp;﻿</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The plot is extremely exaggerated, creating several loopholes. In Fast and Furious, there was a larger cast who joined forces to fight a smaller evil. In Hobbs and Shaw, the reverse occurs —only Hobbs and Shaw are up against a full-fledged, technologically-advanced organization.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Luckily, the movie stands alone. It is not necessary to have seen Fast and Furious 1-8; the only advantages of seeing these films are understanding the exact reason for the conflict between Hobbs and Shaw, as well as the minor references at the end.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For those looking for a movie that is an action masterpiece, “Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw” is the right fit. Without a doubt, it is the best action film to come out following Tom Cruise’s MI6 in 2018. On the other hand, hardcore Fast and Furious fans can look forward to Fast and Furious 9, the ninth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise, which is hitting theaters on May 22, 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw is rated PG-13 for lengthy action scenes containing violence, suggestive material and some explicit language. It is playing at Regal Majestic &amp; IMAX in Silver Spring and ArcLight Cinemas in Bethesda.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31985

In the past, Takoma Park's branch made piñatas to host birthday parties for homeless children and written cards to veterans. "This week, we're working on toiletry bags to help the victims of the recent hurricane in the Bahamas," Anderson says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Anderson, Mehta-Harwitz, and Kunnam are set on organizing two events per month, often times partnering with other organizations such as </span><a href="https://www.specialolympics.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Special Olympics</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><a href="https://takomaparkmd.gov/government/recreation/snow-angels/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Snow Angels</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. "We try to pipeline volunteers there to shovel snow for the elderly and disabled," Mehta-Harwitz says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Mehta-Harwitz wants to utilize the untapped potential of Blair volunteers to expand the scope of Difference Makers. "When you have older kids, there's a lot more versatility," she says. "People can get places on their own and do their own projects."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This versatility comes in handy with passion projects, a key component of Difference Makers. "Passion projects are where people have a particular cause that they're interested in, so they take charge and we just help them," Mehta-Harwitz says. The club hopes that a volunteer base comprised of older students will facilitate more intensive, ongoing project.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kunnam alludes to the joy of helping others. "I like seeing people happy and seeing getting to understand how other people live," she says. "It's very eye opening and rewarding."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Anderson stresses that membership isn't necessary to participate— in fact, students can simply show up to events as a convenient way to earn SSL hours. "It's very low commitment. And people don't have to come to meetings every week to stay for the full length of the meeting," Anderson says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students can commit on an activity-by-activity basis.

Moved by the misfortune of the large orphan population in the community, they established Paper Bridges as a nonprofit to communicate with the students. "It was heartbreaking to see young students struggle and fall behind both socially and academically as a result of a lack of love and affection from their caregivers," Zhang says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At its core, Paper Bridges aims to provide the support these children lack.

32608	The singer’s third album is a refreshing reflection of her last four years	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Jan. 10, Selena Gomez released her third studio album, </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rare</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. The album release follows four years of ups and downs in Gomez’s life and it is all evident in her 13 new carefully-crafted tracks. </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rare</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> is her third number 1 album on the Billboard 200 Chart.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The album is a behind the scenes look at Gomez’s heavily publicized struggles during its four year creation period. She received a kidney transplant from her best friend Francia Raisa after complications from long-term autoimmune disease lupus, dealt with mental health issues in and out of rehabilitation facilities and went through an immensely public breakup with on-off boyfriend Justin Bieber which was followed by Bieber's immediate marriage to Hailey Baldwin.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32607"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gomez’s emotionally-charged rise from the ashes came in the form of “Lose You to Love Me,” which was released on Oct. 23, 2019. The powerful piano-heavy ballad, which earned Gomez her first no. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, turns all of her pain and suffering into empowerment. Fans reading between the lines were quick to realize that the song was likely about her breakup with Bieber. She sings, “In two months, you replaced us / Like it was easy / Made me think I deserved it / In the thick of healing,” making direct references to Bieber’s abrupt rebound with Baldwin. “I needed to lose you to love me,” the message that runs through the chorus, is one of the major themes of the album.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">24 hours after the release of “Lose You to Love Me,” Gomez put out a much more upbeat and dance-heavy tune: “Look at Her Now.” The echoing vocals in the middle of the song are lush and the chorus pops. In line with the subject matter of her heartfelt ballad, she sings, “Of course she was sad, but now she’s glad she dodged a bullet / Took a few years to soak up the tears, but look at her now.” Gomez takes heartbreak and turns it into power.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The contrasting tones of these two songs left fans wondering which vibe the album would have. Many were expecting an album full of confessionals, but the release showed that Gomez truly wanted a fun album about self-love and not being afraid to dance alone. She succeeded through incredible production, as well as infectious themes and melodies that create easy transitions from one track to the next.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The title track “Rare”, which serves as the album opener, is a quiet yet meaningful anthem about self-worth, supported by breathy vocals and minimal drum kicks. A large part of </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rare </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">discusses the emotions behind failed relationships —both romantic ones, like on lead single “Lose You to Love Me,” and friends growing apart in “People You Know.” Track two, “Dance Again,” highlights the importance of dancing past the pain, as Gomez sings, “I kickstart the rhythm / All the trauma's in remission.” Other tracks on the album, albeit catchy, are less personalized and seem to serve solely as transitions to standalone narratives. “Ring,” “Kinda Crazy” and “Fun” could be incorporated into any pop artist’s repertoire; there is no obvious connection to Gomez.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One of the highlights of </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rare</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> is the final track: “A Sweeter Place”, featuring Kid Cudi. The layered vocals over dark yet cathartic synths provide a unique experience. It’s one of the few moments where it seems as though Gomez fully experimented with her sound.

32237	What goes into producing this year's fall play	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Based on the posters for this year's fall play, Blair is in for a fantastic production. One may be looking forward to scenes based off of Aladdin and Alibaba and the 40 thieves, along with the story of Scheherazade and how she helps a ruthless king undergo a massive character arc. But what many Blazers may not know is what goes behind the making of the production and just how much work it takes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair theater teacher Kelly O'Connor and her husband, John O'Connor work on the fall play as directors. The O'Connors begin thinking about what production to perform each fall a year before the production is slated. Even now, the O'Connors are thinking about what play to produce next year.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">John O'Connor attempts to adapt the fall play as accurately as possible, looking at the original source material. "I got the latest translation of [1001 Nights] in English and that was very helpful because what I wanted with all the tales was to produce stories which were faithful to the original way which they were told," John O'Connor says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When deciding what play to produce, the O'Connors look for plays that have a variety of different aspects that are favorable for Blair theatre, such as a large cast and interesting roles. "You want to play that has a nice big cast with roles of a variety of size and challenge. You want to really be able to challenge the more veteran performers, but also give interesting, fun roles for people who are newer at this," Kelly O'Connor says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The directors also attempt to choose plays with large female casts. Since many classic plays focus on a mostly male cast, the O'Connors strive to choose a production that has many female characters, especially since many female students audition for roles in the play. When well-known plays with small female casts are produced, the directors change a large number of male roles into female ones. "Last year, when we did a play about the Trojan War, Agamemnon, King of Kings was played by two female actors and when we did Hamlet, Hamlet was played by two female actors," Kelly O'Connor says. For this year's fall play, every student that auditioned for a role was cast. Almost 70 students tried out for "Tales from 1001 Nights" and every single one received a speaking role, much to the directors' joy.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers with both big and small roles enjoy acting in the play. "It's fun, you get to be someone else for a bit," freshman Jonathan Cumblidge explains. Some students aim for smaller roles during this fall play to hopefully get bigger ones as the year goes by. "I have four lines, it's smaller, but if I do well, I might get a bigger role next time," senior Steven Carrasco says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many actors and actresses feel a connection with the role they're playing. Lead actress and assistant director Hemakshi Gordy has a great amount of respect for the character she portrays. "Something I really love about Scheherazade is that she's a really incredible woman, one of the most incredible women in all of literature, she puts herself in dangers way and not only finds a way to save herself and all the other women but also finds a way to do it that is still fueled by compassion and has this undying faith in the ability of people to change," Gordy says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Actors and actresses with larger roles also have more freedom to explore the role they're cast in. "I'm growing so much as an actor through this role because I have a lot of creative license with this role. Scheherazade tells stories throughout the whole play and me being in her role means that I get to tell the stories through my own interpretation of her experiences," Gordy says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Once rehearsals begin, the O'Connors include student input on different parts of the production. While Kelly and John O'Connor influence the play to fit their view of what the production should look like, both have an open mind, often changing many aspects of the play before opening night.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32236"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As rehearsals continue, the building of the play's set starts as well.&nbsp;Stage crew is broken into sections, but all members of each section spend an amount of time on carpentry since it has a big focus. One of the most essential parts of the production is where it is being performed, and stage crew puts a large emphasis on building that set.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every year, audience members watch the fall play onstage and seating is built by the stage crew. "We always have to build black box walls for the fall plays, every fall play is set on stage and the audience also sits on the stage," Co-president of stage crew Annie Hicks says. Being on stage, audience members have a more active role viewing the production. "It's really great having the audience on three sides since that gives you more flexibility and the whole stage is really alive when the audience is right there with you," Gordy explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A new addition to the special effects for this year's fall play is the use of projectors. Stage crew is hoping to utilize this new technology by integrating them into the background of some scenes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the final few weeks before opening night, actors and actresses attend Saturday rehearsals, which are each six hours long. Since these rehearsals are on weekends, it also allows actors and actresses to approach them with a revitalized energy.&nbsp;"In some ways, it's more fun because you haven't just been through a long school day you're coming fresh," Gordy explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Stage crew also comes in during these rehearsals to finish up sets for the production. Stage crew has a more relaxed schedule compared to actors' and actresses' rehearsals, during these final few weeks, those in charge of building the set try to get as much done as possible.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Costumes are also fitted during these Saturday rehearsals. They are brought from the garage most Blair costumes reside in and are altered by those in charge of costumes. A small number of students and even parents with exemplary sewing skills adjust actors and actresses costumes in the rush of these final rehearsals.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All of the work done for this play will come to fruition on Nov. 14, opening night. Those who are working on the play hope audiences will come in with an open mind. " I hope that people can come into it, looking to hear stories, because that's what it's all about," Gordy says.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32236
31722	Green Club members work to recertify Blair	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery Blair High School has been certified as a "Maryland Green School" with the Maryland Green Schools Award Program (MDGS) since 2012, thanks to the tireless work of Green Club, which spearheads an application to recertify Blair every four years. Now, the club's members are working diligently to meet the deadline of March 18 to earn that title once again</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To qualify for the title, Blair has to demonstrate a variety of accomplishments that tie in with creating a sustainable environment. A crucial part of the award requires youth action and initiative to show that both faculty members and students are working towards to protect the environment. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31721"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Elizabeth Levien, a Chemistry teacher at Blair, says that the Green School certification would show that Blair is taking steps towards sustainability. "It shows that our student body and staff are committed to modeling the best sustainability practices. It will also instill good habits in young people," Levien stated.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Green Club is using the new water bottle refiller stations, along with a variety of climate-related activities at Blair such as indoor plant management and composting bins, to show the steps Blair has taken to be greener. "It is actually not that hard to certify; Blair already does a lot of environmentally beneficial things. It's really just a matter of finding them and putting it together," Green Club co-president Anna Brookes said. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Other high schools in Montgomery County who have been certified include Poolesville, Richard Montgomery and Northwood.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Levien believes that becoming certified as a Green School is only the first step towards becoming a greener school. "It's nice to have the label, but I do think that there is room for improvement and stronger change. For one thing, people shouldn't view recycling as the solve-all green practice but instead really strive to reduce the amount of waste in the first place," Levien said. </span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To find out more information about Maryland Green Schools, visit to </em><a href="https://maeoe.org/green-schools-and-green-centers/green-schools-program" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>MAEOE.org</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</em></p>	31721
33273	Football does not have a G.O.A.T.	<p>Tom Brady: six-time Super Bowl Champion, four-time Super Bowl MVP, three-time League MVP, 14-time Pro Bowl selection, three-time First-team All-Pro, two-time NFL Offensive Player of the Year. His list of achievements and honors goes on and on, but is he really the Greatest Football Player of All Time (G.O.A.T.)?</p><p><strong>Charlie's take</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I despise Tom Brady just as much as the next person. I have never rooted for him or his New England Patriots to win. Having been raised in San Francisco, I was supplied with Joe Montana highlight reels from a young age. It was impossible for me to imagine any quarterback more dominant or skillful than “Golden Joe.” However, as my knowledge of football grew, it became more and more difficult to deny the truth: “TB12” is the greatest to ever play the game.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLooking at the raw statistics is the first step in understanding why Brady is the G.O.A.T. He ranks second in career passing yards and passing touchdowns, trailing only New Orleans Saints’ legend Drew Brees. Brady ranks No. 6 all-time in passer rating and No. 16 in completion percentage. But what sets Brady apart is remarkable longevity and a decorated career of awards, accolades, and Super Bowls.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tNow in his 21st season, Brady has played 290 games and will soon pass Brett Favre for the most games played by a quarterback in league history. During his lengthy career, he has collected three Most Valuable Player awards, 14 Pro Bowl selections, three First-team All-Pro selections, along with countless other honors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe most impressive and important of his achievements, however, are his rings. His record six Super Bowl wins and four Super Bowl MVP trophies prove his superiority over the entire NFL. In the playoffs, no other quarterback can compare to Brady. Take Brees, for example. As referenced before, Brees edges out Brady in both career passing yards and touchdowns. But Brees’ single championship and limited number of deep playoff runs suggest that his statistical success is a mere reflection of the weakness of his conference, the NFC South.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tNow that I’ve incontrovertibly established that Brady is the G.O.A.T., I must address the common counter-argument that his successes can be attributed to New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick. Quite frankly, this is a moronic argument. Belichick had a losing record with the Cleveland Browns before becoming the Patriots head coach in 2000. After joining New England, he led the Patriots to five wins and a dismal 13 losses before Drew Bledsoe’s fateful injury and Brady’s subsequent rise to dominance as the starting quarterback.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIt’s obvious that the two enjoyed mutual success, but that does not diminish Brady’s career accomplishments. If you think Belichick’s coaching genius stains Brady’s legacy, you must also eliminate Joe Montana and Jerry Rice from the G.O.A.T. conversation, as they both benefited greatly from the legendary coach Bill Walsh and his famed “West Coast offense.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOnce you learn to put all anti-Patriots bias aside and look at Tom Brady’s career objectively, it’s easy to conclude that Brady is the greatest football player of all time. To say otherwise is blasphemy.</span></p><p><strong>Ayush's take</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Football does not have a G.O.A.T. The conversation always surrounds the quarterbacks––Tom Brady, Joe Montana, and the Manning brothers to name a few. But the idea that quarterbacks are somehow more important than running backs, wide receivers, or anyone on defense is deeply flawed.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tComparing players at the quarterback position is a much more reasonable way to have the G.O.A.T. argument. But quite frankly, Tom Brady is not even the greatest quarterback of all time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tNow, I am not going to deny that Brady is a great player. He is by far the most accomplished to play the game. Period. But Brady is a system quarterback and the product of the greatest coach of all time: Bill Belichick.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe notion that Brady is solely responsible for the New England Patriots’ dynasty is completely and utterly false. Theoretically, if any top-15 quarterback replaced Brady in Belichick’s system, they would be more accomplished than Brady.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tStatistically, Brady’s play is just above average. Even though he’s played the second-most games in quarterback history, he sits 16th all-time in completion percentage––under the likes of Kirk Cousins, Phillip Rivers, Derek Carr, and Matt Shaub. Brady does not lead a single major individual statistical category. He was not the factor that led to the Patriots’ long list of success. As a matter of fact, Brady’s mediocrity hindered the potential of Belichick’s reign.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBrady’s style of play is nothing to marvel at. Over the course of almost 300 games played in the NFL, he has mastered the art of the checkdown. Whether it was a five-yard post to Gronkowski or a drag to Edelman, Brady was not the one making big plays and winning games during his time in New England. Theoretically, if Brady was the G.O.A.T. and was paired with a top-five wideout talent of all time, the expectation would be that he wins a Super Bowl, right? Wrong. Randy Moss and Tom Brady never won a championship. Instead, they lost to Eli Manning and the talent-starved, 10-win New York Giants in the 2012 Super Bowl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tPair an innately talented quarterback––the likes of Patrick Mahomes and Russell Wilson, for example––with Belichick’s genius and the most consistent defense this league has ever seen, and you have well more than a mere six Super Bowls in 19 seasons.</span></p>	33272
33080	Netflix strikes gold yet again with its latest hit documentary miniseries	<p>If you are looking for a major distraction from the global pandemic, look no further than Netflix’s <em>Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness.</em> The latest pop cultural sensation has swept the internet, generating endless memes and discussions about the series’ absurd content.&nbsp;</p><p>Do not be mistaken, though, as the show is not at all your average National Geographic documentary on tigers, but a harrowing exploration of the dark world of zookeeping and the eccentric and arguably immoral rulers behind it all.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33079"></div><p><br></p><p>The show follows the show’s eponymous figure, Joseph “Joe Exotic” Maldonado-Passage, and his motley crew of zookeepers as he struggles to maintain his Oklahoma zoo of over 200 tigers and other big cats. Conflicts arise not only from within but from outside forces as Exotic grapples with animal rights activist Carole Baskin and her attempts to shut down his zoo.</p><p>In the first few episodes, Exotic is admittedly compelling as many viewers find themselves strangely enthralled by his emblematic mullet, marriages with multiple men, self-produced country music videos—the list goes on and on. Whether Exotic is a real person or an ungodly parody of Steve Irwin becomes almost indiscernible.</p><p>However, beneath the animal-printed facade lies an unstable man who has clearly drifted from his original mission of rescuing big cats from the wild. Exotic may very well be the living embodiment of ‘You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain.’</p><p>Incident after incident, Exotic falls into a web of trouble as he desperately tries to maintain his reputation. As Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin viciously go back and forth with slanderous online videos from Joe’s end and a slew of lawsuits from Carole’s, their tit-for-tat conflict seemingly never-ends. Exotic even goes so far as to hire a hitman to take out Carole Baskin and, as a result, the series climaxes with his sentencing to 22 years in prison on two counts of murder for hire and 17 federal charges of animal abuse.</p><p>While Joe Exotic may seem like the main miscreant, it is difficult to root for anyone. Really, the only enjoyable personalities were the other zookeepers at Joe’s zoo and Mario Tabraue—the man who allegedly inspired Tony Montana in the iconic 1983 film “Scarface.” It is shocking yet ironic that the man who inspired one of the most vicious characters ever in cinema is seen as an angel compared to the documentary’s focal figures.</p><p>Ethics and morality are virtually nowhere to be found. Carole Baskin, the hippy-dippy animal rights activist working against Exotic is just as cruel, with animals confined in wire cages and volunteers working for extended periods, earning no money whatsoever. And all that does not even come close to the full scope of her controversy.</p><p>One of the main discussions the show has produced is whether Carole Baskin murdered her husband, Don Lewis. The documentary focuses on Baskin and Lewis’s mysterious past relationship, honing in on Lewis’s puzzling disappearance. Although the twenty-year case remains open today, the documentary has essentially made up its mind on the matter: Carole Baskin was definitely involved in murdering her husband.</p><p>But while Carole Baskin murdering her husband may seem like the most entertaining and memeworthy explanation of his disappearance, the show provides little factual evidence to support its suspicions, merely opting to show gossip from the other characters and denial from Carole and her current husband.&nbsp;</p><p>This is one of the show’s main pitfalls: It sacrifices any sense of veracity for crafting an insane yet captivating narrative. As true as its events may be, viewers should choose to take the show with a grain of salt, though there is no denying that it is an absolute spectacle that is nearly impossible to not binge-watch for seven hours straight.</p><p><em>Tiger King </em>also proves to be as deeply compelling as it is disturbing and insensitive. Even though the documentary’s purpose is to detail the incidents leading up to Exotic’s conviction, at times it is unclear as to why certain events are emphasized and others are not.</p><p>The show glosses over serious matters such as 23-year-old Travis Maldonado’s suicide, and instead chooses to focus on Exotic’s pompous gubernatorial campaign just a few episodes later. It is altogether hilarious but horrific, leaving viewers with a sour taste in their mouth after learning of all the atrocities mentioned in the show.</p><p>There is obviously much more to be discussed beyond what <em>Tiger King</em> is able to compress in seven short episodes. Analyzing moments such as Doc Antle’s unsettling harem of female zookeepers, Jeff Lowe’s shady business deals, and even that glorious shot of James Garretson jet riding into the sunset can produce hours of discussion.</p><p>But for all that it is, <em>Tiger King</em>\tis a wild ride from start to finish. Five years of production and a storyline spanning almost two decades culminates into a highly contentious yet engaging look at a disturbing, fascinating subculture.&nbsp;</p><p>4/5 stars.</p>	33079
31697	Developments in artificial intelligence make transportation a breeze	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cars zooming around with no one behind the wheel—it may seem like something out of a science fiction movie. However, companies like Uber and Tesla are quickly developing cutting-edge technology and sensors that could make it happen. Thanks to the ubiquity of cars in today's society, the development of self-driving cars has the potential to reinvent our lives.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Self-driving cars rely on </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609674/whats-driving-autonomous-vehicles/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">sensors, cameras, data processors and artificial intelligence</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to detect and respond to their surroundings. On-board cameras spot and collect data on things like lane lines, speed limit signs and traffic lights. Radars send out radio waves to sense the presence, distance, angle and velocity of nearby objects. Machine learning, an artificial intelligence tool, trains computers to improve performance and adapt to changing circumstances as it learns from past experiences.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31696"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Today's driver-assistance systems, like </span><a href="https://www.tesla.com/autopilot" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Tesla's Enhanced Autopilot</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, offer hands-free driving in some situations, but are still short of full automation on the classification system of Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) International, an automotive standardization body. In the six SAE Levels of Driving Automation, Level Zero features absolutely no automation, Level One to Level Four feature an automated driving system executing a portion of the tasks, and Level 5 means every task is automated.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Tesla's autopilot system offers lane centering, adaptive cruise control, self-parking and the ability to change lanes with driver confirmation. In November 2018, Tesla debuted a feature called Navigate on Autopilot, which gives its cars the ability to change lanes to get around slower drivers or to leave the highway when it reaches an exit.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Deeya Garg drives a 2015 Tesla Model S, which is a sedan that includes Tesla's first version of autopilot, AutoPilot 1 (AP1). The system can sense lane lines as long as they aren't blurred or snowed over, change lanes with driver confirmation and adjust to the speed and position of cars in front of it.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even with autopilot on, Garg needs to keep her hands on the wheel while driving. "Once, I took my hands off to do something and the car kept beeping at me. It gave me three warnings and didn't let me use autopilot again for the rest of the trip," she says. Some people use a hack to get around this feature by </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJH_L0ZLOfw" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">placing water bottles or other objects on the steering wheel</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> so that the sensor detects a weight and thinks that the driver's hand is on the wheel.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Garg cautions that although the autopilot makes accidents more unlikely, everyone should be careful and not rely on autopilot too much. "You still have to be fully conscious of what you're doing. Some people feel like with autopilot they're in the backseat, and that's not how it should be," she says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the multitude of companies testing them, fully automated self-driving cars are years away from being available for private ownership. Instead, they will probably debut in limited areas as highway-bound trucks or taxi-like fleets. Before self-driving technology is open for commercial use, government and tech companies must address questions such as how the technology will impact the environment and economy and how to protect it against cybersecurity attacks.</span></p>	31696
32335	College athletes should be allowed to make money off their name	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The NCAA made a new rule that will allow athletes to make money off their name, image and likeness starting in 2023. California was the first to pass this law, leading the NCAA in the right direction.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">It is good to see the NCAA finally accepting change for once, but this law still under represents student athletes, keeping a clear distinction between professional athletes and collegiate athletes. Students won't be recognized as employees under the new rule, which in reality is what they are.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The NCAA is principally a business once scholarship money comes into play, the athletes become "employees" of their school. The money spent on stadiums, coaches and advertising makes the NCAA a business not a nonprofit.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many have called out universities for not compensating student athletes despite the hours they put into their craft and the millions of dollars their coaches earn a year. The University of Alabama's football coach, Nick Saban makes $7.5 million a year while the average scholarship for student athletes is on $18,000 a year.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This $18,000 does not cover annual expenses, or college tuition, and with the amount of hours student athletes spend playing their sport and doing school work, they have little to no time to get a job. This can make it hard for them and their families to support themselves financially.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the NCAA's recent change, the organization somehow still argues that California's law is unconstitutional,The NCAA's stance is especially ironic when you look at how the current rules violate the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The FLSA gives the right to a minimum wage for all American workers, establishing a maximum of 40 hours a week without extra pay for overtime. It also guarantees established workmen's compensation for all workers who would be injured. The NCAA is a business so therefore they violate multiple parts of the FLSA.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The most notable part of the FLSA that affects student athletes is the guaranteed workers compensation for injuries. Currently athletes can be kicked off the team and lose their scholarship if they get hurt or injured, meaning they don't have a worker's compensation even after their hours of work put into their craft. In 1991 the NCAA established a 20 hour rule, keeping coaches from making their students practice for over 20 hours a week. This allowed the NCAA to not be recognized as a business. However, worker's compensation, and a basic flow of money is a basic right that all workers get no matter the hours they work, except for student athletes.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32334"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The NCAA needs to understand that their athletes are not being treated fairly, being compensated correctly for all the work they put in and all the money they make for the school and the organization. The NCAA is profiting off of work that is not being paid for. The "Fair Pay to Play Act" is a step in the right direction, but until student athletes are classified as employees then they are being cheated out of hard earned money.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32334
33276	Talks of reopening raise concerns about ventilation efficacy in MCPS.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS is currently investigating the possibility of opening schools during the second quarter for select groups of students with the highest degree of need, possibly renouncing their previous announcement that the first semester would be conducted entirely virtually.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33275"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS sent an email to staff members on Sept. 25 giving a 45-day notice of the possibility of returning to in-person classes. The notice was required by a deal agreed upon by the Montgomery County Education Association (MCEA) and MCPS. Superintendent Jack Smith clarified that the notification does not signify that MCPS will shift to in-person learning. “This does not mean that in-person instruction will begin in 45 days,” he wrote. “It means that we can… do more in-depth collaborative planning for the eventual return to instruction in buildings.”</span></p><p>The MCEA president, Christopher Lloyd, declined to comment for this story.</p><p>The possibility of returning to in-person classes places a burden on MCPS to keep students safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19 within schools, a task that school districts across the country have struggled with.&nbsp;</p><p>Heating, ventilation, and air condition (HVAC) systems are essential to limiting the spread of COVID-19, according to Linsey Marr, <span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">the Charles P. Lunsford Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> at Virginia Tech. “[HVAC systems] are critical. Ideally, you could open the windows if the weather is conducive for it. That will greatly improve ventilation, preventing a buildup of virus in the air,” she said in a press conference.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During the same press conference, panelists stressed the importance of ventilation and airflow in indoor spaces to stop the spread of COVID-19, as virus particles can travel further than six feet in the air. By keeping air flowing in a classroom coupled with the use of masks, the likelihood of spreading the virus decreases significantly and prevents a buildup of virus particles in the air of a classroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS’s Key Facility Report from 2019 reported that Blair’s HVAC system was classified as needing review. This means minor components may need repair but the system as a whole did not need to be fixed or replaced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">William Rose, a math teacher at Blair, described his experiences with ventilation at Blair as flawed. “Blair’s ventilation system does not work perfectly. On any given day, there are sometimes some rooms that are receiving no airflow.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to Rose,&nbsp;the quality of the HVAC systems varies from room to room. “There are some rooms that are just totally not air-conditioned, and some days when it's cold, there are some rooms that are not getting any heat,” he said. “It's a constant problem. They're always kind of trying to fix it, but it seems that it's never fixed.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During a Board of Education meeting on Oct. 6, Smith noted that the MCPS is trying&nbsp;to upgrade air filters and HVAC systems. He said MCPS has requested additional funding for these measures from the Montgomery County Council and that the request is currently under review.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The procurement contracts presented at the Board of Education meeting from Smith reveal that MCPS wishes to purchase HEPA air filters, which trap harmful particles in the environment, and indoor air quality equipment and supplies.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The county has already begun to utilize school buildings, largely for SAT testing. In these situations, an emphasis on social distancing has taken priority over an overhaul of any ventilation systems.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Scott Murphy, the MCPS Director of College and Career Readiness, oversees SAT testing in MCPS buildings. Murphy said that many social distancing measures have been taken. "Capacity was limited to 250 students at each high school testing site,” he explained. “There were no more than 10 students in a normal size classroom during SAT testing."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Murphy also noted that during testing, masks were provided and students answered a health questionnaire, per requirements from the College Board.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Kimberly Prather, an expert on aerosols (small liquid droplets suspended in the air) and a professor at the University of California San Diego, recommends as many people as possible within the school should be notified of a COVID-19 case should it occur. Virus particles often move farther than six feet, and masks alone do not fully mitigate one’s inhalation of the virus indoors. “If [schools] have [all] desks six feet apart and someone gets infected, the whole class is not told,” she said. “I personally think that that kind of guidance should be changed so that everyone in that classroom… [is made aware].”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to an informal Silver Chips survey, 25 out of 37 Blair students said they would not feel safe returning to in-person classes in the second quarter. Additionally, 26 out of 37 students said that they don’t believe MCPS can protect students from catching COVID-19.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While students overwhelmingly said that they would not feel safe returning to in-person classes,&nbsp;26 out of 37 students believe that they would perform better academically should classes shift to an in-person format. Still, 21 out of 37 of students said they would choose virtual learning over in-person classes for the second marking period.</span></p>	33275
32979	Netflix’s “Enola Holmes” is a wonderfully fun movie about puzzles and family.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The cultural impact of Sherlock Holmes is hard to understate, producing countless stories as well as spin-offs. “Enola Holmes,” released on September 23, brings a new perspective to the screen by telling the story of Sherlock’s younger sister, Enola (Millie Bobby Brown). Based on </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Enola Holmes Mysteries</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> by Nancy Springer and directed by Harry Bradbeer, “Enola Holmes” explores the life and adventures of Enola Holmes, who has a knack for mysteries and a desire to find the truth.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Enola is an independent young girl who was raised by her single mother (Helena Bonham Carter). Conflict arises when one day, her mother mysteriously disappears. When her older brothers, Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft Holmes (Sam Claflin), threaten to place her in a finishing school to ensure she is brought up well, Enola is forced to strike out on her own in an attempt to solve the mystery behind her mother’s disappearance. On the way, she meets the Viscount Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge), a young runaway fleeing unknown attackers. Together, they explore and unravel a plot that threatens the future of London.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This film is incredibly fun, and is very tongue in cheek. At many points during the movie, Brown turns to the camera for a quick aside that recaps the film up to the current point. These asides are funny, and Brown’s energy makes them even more enjoyable. However, there are some moments when Brown’s monologues to the camera feel forced, and take away from the action. When this happens, it can feel like the movie stops in order to make a comment, and then continues again at the same pace. This does make some parts of the movie feel exhausting, due to the quick jumps, and could be fixed by making sure to maintain tension, and not throw it away for jokes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, the editing does manage to create a light feeling, with cheerful music and the intro, which with its voiceover and light-hearted animations can either feel extremely fun or slightly tiresome, depending on personal taste. As a result, despite a 2 hours and 3 minute runtime, "Enola Holmes" moves relatively quickly. The exception to this is the beginning, and the couple of times when asides break the action, but the energy only occasionally falters once the movie is truly underway.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32980"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The actors in “Enola Holmes” are all talented, and play the characters extremely well. Brown perfectly encapsulates the bright and tomboyish character of Enola, while Partridge plays an endearingly loyal, if sometime bland, Tewkesbury. Sherlock and Mycroft do not appear very often, but when on screen they embody the characters well, with interesting twists on classic portrayals. In general, all the actors are fun to watch, and make the movie very enjoyable.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As an adaptation, “Enola Holmes” holds up. The movie is based on the first book of </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Enola Holmes Mysteries</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, written in 2006. It is a surprisingly faithful adaptation, with only a few changes from the source material to add tension and to include more action scenes. Many of the changes were most likely made in order to bring the movie to a satisfying conclusion. This is probably to make up for the fact that it does not cover the whole series, but despite the small changes, “Enola Holmes” stays accurate to the book and brings the characters to the screen with extreme detail.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Enola Holmes” includes important historical issues relevant in the 1900s, including reform bills that lowered voting restrictions and women’s suffrage movements. There are a few moments where the movie strays from realism in portraying these events, including some simplification. However, this is most likely in order to create a more compelling story, and so is understandable. The way that historical social movements are portrayed helps to give a context for the story that grounds it, despite some inaccuracies.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Overall, “Enola Holmes” has clever dialogue, an upbeat feeling and an excellent cast. It is a wonderful film to watch as a family, especially for fans of the book series.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Enola Holmes” is rated PG-13 for some violence, and is now available on Netflix.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32980
33278	How Native tribes are coping with COVID-19 despite a lack of federal funding.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tChristine Benally, a member of the Navajo Nation in the midwest, works to lower the rates of violence in Native populations through community outreach. Native communities often have high amounts of childhood abuse, which can lead to trauma and a host of health issues. Benally sees these issues so often that she calls it “a pandemic in itself.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThis trauma can lead to a higher risk for substance abuse and chronic disease, which can increase susceptibility to COVID-19. “Those who have these addictions or diseases are at a higher risk for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality,” Benally explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAcross the country, the pandemic has hit Native communities hard. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Native groups make up 1.3 percent of COVID-19 cases while accounting for only 0.7 percent of the U.S. population.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33277"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In Maryland, however, it is hard to tell how tribes are faring since the state does not track COVID-19 infections for Native communities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThere are currently two recognized tribes in Maryland, the Piscataway Indian Nation and the Piscataway Conoy Tribe, as well as several recognized indigenous groups. None of these communities have received any state or federal COVID-19 funding.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tState and federal governments can choose to recognize tribes, but what that recognition entails can vary. In Maryland, state recognition acknowledges a tribe's existence and allows it to have public gatherings, but it doesn’t grant funding or qualify the nation for land rights.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFederal recognition, on the other hand, means access to funding and programs. Since no Maryland tribes are federally recognized, they are not allowed these benefits. To become federally recognized, tribes need to prove their sovereignty to the U.S. government through either an executive order, a historical treaty, or an act of Congress.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAside from state or federal recognition, tribes can receive funding through non-profit organizations, such as the Cedarville Band of Piscataway Indians, Inc. in Maryland.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHowever, the struggle for funding doesn’t end if a tribe is federally recognized. While the federal government appropriated $420 million directly to tribes through the Coronavirus Aides, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in April, tribes still received significantly less funding than states per person. For example, the Navajo Nation and the state of Alaska have roughly the same total amount of infections, but Alaska was appropriated $1,708 per person, while the Navajo Nation only received $44 per person living on the reservation. While the Navajo Nation isn’t reflective of all tribes, it is one of the largest in the country and has had one of the most drastic outbreaks.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBut problems don’t just arise from the limited amount of money tribes receive. Federal money, if granted, comes with a time limit. In the case of the CARES Act, the deadline to spend relief money is Dec. 31, according to Bette Jacobs, professor at Georgetown and a member of the Cherokee Nation. Moreover, Jacobs says that if tribes spend the money outside of CARES Act stipulations, they may have to pay it back.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThree months may seem like sufficient time to spend relief money, but it can take a while to allocate funds effectively towards the underlying problems that have made the pandemic worse. “It's not like this is the purchase of certain supplies,” Jacobs says. “This is infrastructure issues, and medical records, and capacities of that nature.” Jacobs underscores how tribes don’t just need personal protective equipment</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">; </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">they need fundamental change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOne of the areas Jacobs points to is infrastructure improvements, such as across the board access to well-built homes and reliable internet. While the funding from the CARES Act could help tribes get back on their feet from COVID-19, it all depends on whether they can spend the money in time, according to Jacobs.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOne issue that has exacerbated the infection rates of COVID-19 is the state of Native homes. One-third of homes on reservations are considered overcrowded by the National Congress of American Indians. Living in such close proximity puts everyone in the home at greater risk for COVID-19 if all household members are not able to keep a strict quarantine. This is not always possible since, according to a Harvard University study from September, 51 percent of Native people had internet connectivity issues, meaning they might not be able to telework.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAdditionally, according to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, 12 percent of homes on reservations have insufficient heating and cooling systems, as opposed to 0.1 percent of U.S. households overall. Since COVID-19 spreads through small particles in the air, an inadequate ventilation system leads to an increased chance of contracting the virus.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn addition to safety concerns, the pandemic has heightened economic strains on Native communities. According to Harvard University, 46 percent of Native adults have had their hours cut, been furloughed, or lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19. In comparison, the average monthly national unemployment rate during the pandemic is about 10 percent.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThese patterns of inequity across the country are true in Maryland as well. Jansikwe Medina-Tayac, who is a member of the Piscataway Indian Nation and graduated Blair in 2020, says that while her immediate family in the Washington D.C. region is doing fairly well, members of her tribe in southern Maryland have been struggling from a lack of medical attention and relief funding. “A lot of times, it's really expensive to go to the doctor, or the doctor’s far away,” she says. In response, Medina-Tayac says urban members of the nation have been helping from afar by raising money for masks and supporting each other through the pandemic and beyond.</span></p>	33277
32459	The kits provide materials to combat traumatic injuries.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Through a grant from the Department of Homeland Security,&nbsp;Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) is putting “Stop the Bleed” kits in each of its 208 schools. The kits, paired with a 90-minute training session, provide school staff with the appropriate knowledge and resources to stop bleeding from traumatic injuries during emergencies.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Stop the Bleed” is a national awareness campaign that was launched in Oct. 2015 by the White House. According to the organization’s </span><a href="https://www.stopthebleed.org/learn-more" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">website</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, “Someone who is severely bleeding can bleed to death in as little as 5 minutes. That’s why bleeding control, keeping the blood inside the body, is the purpose of Stop the Bleed training.” The campaign is to educate the public, who is always at the scene of an accident before emergency personnel, about how to control serious bleeding.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32458"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The 90-minute training session focuses on three simple but important steps: apply direct pressure, pack a wound and use a tourniquet. A formal presentation is followed by hands-on learning. Currently, only MCPS school security personnel have received the training. The next step is to train health educators, who will then give the training to high school students in conjunction with standard lessons on first aid and CPR. It is unknown whether other faculty will be trained, but anyone who wants to be trained can find the information on the organization’s </span><a href="https://www.stopthebleed.org/training" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">website</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Stop the Bleed” is becoming more valuable due to the increasing amount of school shootings throughout the United States. There have been </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/15/us/2019-us-school-shootings-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">45</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> shootings on school grounds in the 46 weeks of the year. At least </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/11/14/saugus-school-shooting-california-how-many-2019-school-shootings/4190941002/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">30</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> of those shootings resulted in death or injuries.&nbsp;On Nov. 14 at Saugus High School in CA, where five students were shot and two were killed, staff used </span><a href="https://www.stopthebleed.org/learn-more/khn-saugus" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">two</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> bleeding control kits to aid the injured students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In MCPS, which has endured several threats for violence over the last few years, the kits are a safety precaution measure. There were three bomb threats and 130 physical and verbal threats reported at county schools during the 2017-2018 school year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">School health nurse Anisa Harris thinks the “Stop the Bleed Kits” will have a positive impact. “It is always good to have something in case of an emergency. We all hope that we will never have to use ‘Stop the Bleed’ kits, but it’s good to know that we have one, in case it’s needed,” Harris said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Harris concludes that it is extremely beneficial to teach students, in addition to educators, how to use the kits. “Anytime there’s an emergency, the more people who know how to use emergency equipment, the better. Just like everybody needs to know CPR and everybody learns how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED), it’ll be good to have people who know how to use a ‘Stop the Bleed Kit’ too.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32458
31954	"Quiz whiz" Sophia Weng competed against two other students across the nation	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On June 19, rising senior Sophia Weng represented Blair at the 2019 Jeopardy! Teen Tournament hosted by television personality Alex Trebek. She competed against Rohit Kataria, a junior from Wheelersburg, Ohio, and Justin Bolsen, a freshman from Canton, Georgia.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Jeopardy! Teen Tournament features 15 high school contestants between the ages of 15 and 18 in a two week event. Every weekday night from June 17-28, a Teen Jeopardy! episode is broadcast on television. Five quarterfinal games, each between three contestants, take place during the first week. The winners from these games, combined with the next four highest scorers, compete in the semifinals. The three winners from the semifinals participate in two final games, with their cumulative score determining the champion and winner of $100,000.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31953"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every game is comprised of a Jeopardy! Round, followed by a Double Jeopardy! Round and a Final Jeopardy! Round. The Jeopardy! round has five general categories, each containing five clues weighted by difficulty— $200, $400, $600, $800 and $1,000. Double Jeopardy! follows a similar structure, but the value of each clue is double its original value. Final Jeopardy! has a single clue, with a 30-second time limit for contestants to write down their answer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Weng's experience with trivia competitions extends far past Jeopardy!. She competes with Blair for a local trivia game show, It's Academic. She is also a member of Blair's competitive trivia teams, including Quizbowl, Science Bowl, History Bowl, Ocean Science Bowl and Envirothon. According to Weng, Teen Jeopardy! was just another day in her life. "It was kind of business as usual, because I do so much studying for Quizbowl and History Bowl and all my other competitions," she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All of the practicing paid off as Weng showed up and competed as if the game show was any other trivia competition. The first round consisted of categories "Computer Connections," "Kings &amp; Queens," "Hodgepodge," "Book Chapters," "5-Syllable Words" and "The D.C. Universe." Weng initially dropped into the negatives by answering clues incorrectly but soon recovered. She held second place by the end of the round with $4,400, while Bolsen and Kataria had $8,000 and $3,400 respectively.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After the first commercial break, Trebek spoke with each of the contestants. Weng introduced Magnet Arts Night, the Blair Magnet's annual student-run talent show, to the audience members. "[CAP students], once upon a time, believed that math students couldn't do art, and they couldn't act, and they couldn't perform, so we decided to show them wrong," she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The next round, Double Jeopardy!, had categories "Extracurricular," "Animals," "Music I'm not Familiar With," "Big Rivers," "Crossword Clues 'N'" and "The D.C. Universe." Bolsen pulled ahead by successfully completing three Daily Doubles. At the end of the second round, Weng was again in last place with $6,800, while Bolsen held $25,300 and Kataria held $11,400.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Before the final round, Bolsen had already secured his advancement to the semifinals. The day's competition was a "lock game," defined by the </span><a href="http://www.j-archive.com/help.php#lock" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Jeopardy! Archive</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> as "the scenario in which the score of the player in second place is less than one-half the score of the player in first place." Bolsen secured his victory by only wagering $42.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Final Jeopardy! round consisted of a single clue from the "Ancient Literature" category: "If you were using an alternate name, the title of this work could be translated as 'Troy Story.'" Bolsen and Weng correctly answered the clue with "The Iliad," while Kataria failed to respond. Bolsen ended in first place with $25,342, Weng in second with $13,600 and Kataria in third with $0.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although Weng is out of the running for 2019, the rest of the Jeopardy! Teen Tournament will play on WJLA-TV, weekdays at 7:30 p.m. and ending on June 28.</span></p>	31953

This drop in enrollment was based in Kindergarten and Pre-K, whose enrollment rates decreased at the highest rates. Many appear to be choosing instead to receive a private or homeschool education.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33028"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From July 1, 2019 to Sept. 16, 2019, 51 students total withdrew from MCPS to instead receive homeschooling, and 129 students withdrew to instead attend a Maryland nonpublic school not located in Montgomery County. During the same time period in 2020, 984 students withdrew from MCPS to receive homeschooling and 950 students opted to withdraw from MCPS to attend nonpublic schools not located in Montgomery County.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair principal Renay Johnson said she believes that this drop in enrollment is based in the younger grades. “I think most parents are thinking, ‘My child’s first experience [with education] will not be online.’ They may select a private school that has in-person kindergarten, or they may waive the first year," Johnson said. “A lot of families, they want in-person learning for their elementary aged students."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">President of the MCPS Board of Education Shebra Evans said that the board had always been expecting some kind of drop. “Prior to COVID, we were predicting that our numbers this upcoming fall would not be the same as we had seen traditionally...but we attribute some of that to our international numbers going down” due to concern regarding federal policies, Evans said. Evans also explained that enrollment numbers do fluctuate at the beginning of the school year, so it’s possible that they could go up slightly.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, Evans concurred with Johnson that this drop may be due to Pre-K and Kindergarten students. “There are some parents that are possibly not sending their Pre-K and Kindergarten students because this is a virtual world, it’s a little bit different,” Evans said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Valerie Grussing is one of those parents. Even though she is a firm believer in public education for her children and under most circumstances would not send them to a private school, Grussing has decided to send her Kindergarten-age son to a private school. “It was a really difficult decision not to go that route, but we just felt like we didn’t have any other choice for our family, for both of us to be able to keep our jobs and for all of us to be able to keep our sanity,” Grussing said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Johnson also noted that while these lower grade levels may be suffering from enrollment drops, enrollment drops at the high school level are extremely low. In fact, according to information from earlier in the year, the overall MCPS enrollment for grades 9-12 actually increased from the 2019-2020 to 2020-2021 school year by 0.38%.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Regardless of the format MCPS schools have taken, Evans reiterated that MCPS priorities have not changed since entering the virtual environment and that MCPS is doing everything they can to support parents and students during this difficult time. “We’re really trying to make certain that we can help as many kids as we can through this virtual environment,” she said.</span></p>	33028
32948	The singer’s sixth album uses purposeful pop to cheer us up amidst the pandemic	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pop singer Katy Perry released her sixth studio album </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Smile </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">on Aug. 28. The album features Perry’s new style of “purposeful pop” (mainstream music with a deeper meaning) and its tracks focus on positivity during these hard times. While it differs from her past albums, </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Smile</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> is definitely well-written and features a variety of styles that we haven’t seen from Perry so far.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Smile</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> is the epitome of growth in Perry’s singing styles. Perry’s earlier hits, which included record-breaking “Teenage Dream” (2010) and “Roar,” (2013) all fit the typical high energy style of 2000s pop </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> bubbly, loud and perfect for parties. Perry’s earlier albums, such as</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Prism </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">(2013)</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">and</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> One Of The Boys </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">(2008), have an anthem-style pop vibe that is known to reliably guarantee hits, complete with Perry’s powerful belting and signature high-pitched choruses.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Over time, Perry has been trying to transition from her brand of bubbly and anthem-esque pop to what she calls “purposeful pop.” As its name suggests, Perry wants her songs to have a deeper meaning to them, not just vague songs for partying and dancing to. "I’ve seen behind the curtain, and I can’t go back. I used to be the queen of innuendo, everything done with a wink. Now I want to be the queen of subtext— which is a cousin to innuendo, but it’s got more purpose," Perry said in an </span><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-purposeful-pop-katy-perrys-new-sound-for-witness-would-be-a-big-departure-61798#:~:text=When%20explaining%20exactly%20what%20%22purposeful,but%20it's%20got%20more%20purpose.%22" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">interview with Vogue</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With her 2017 album </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Witness</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Perry started her transformation with an inclusion of more reflective music. The album featured a variety of different electronic styles, with influences from Swedish pop, 80s throwbacks, and 90s house shuffle. Perry collaborated with many different songwriters and artists, from Nicki Minaj on “Swish Swish” to Skip Marley on lead single “Chained To The Rhythm.”</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Witness</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, with its wide range of different electropop styles, definitely opened up Perry’s musical range and versatility. However, it received negative feedback from the pop industry, making it Perry’s worst performing album to date. Many consider it to be too different without Perry’s signature singing style. As a result, the album peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 for only 15 weeks, a weak showing compared to her top hit “Dark Horse” (2013), which held the #1 spot for 57 weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Between </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Witness </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">and </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Smile</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Perry released a few singles that fit her “purposeful pop” vision.

Perry uses softer EDM backgrounds to give off dancey yet lowkey vibes, a combination that is becoming increasingly popular in the pop industry nowadays.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The album’s title track “Smile” is definitely more upbeat and high energy than the other songs on the album. While it might not be as unique as the other tracks, it still shares the same purpose of making us feel better and hopefully putting a smile on our faces.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The penultimate track, “Only Love,” addresses the feelings we all share during the COVID-19 pandemic </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> loneliness, lack of motivation and uncertainty. Perry turns these feelings into an endearing homage to her loved ones, reminding us that love can prevail even in times of darkness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Perry ends the album with “What Makes A Woman,” a soulful personal reflection on her life experience as a woman. She pays tribute to the power of women and how indescribably unique they are in the chorus: “Spend your whole life but you couldn’t / Describe what makes a woman/ That’s what makes a woman to me.” As a new mother herself, Perry explores the ever-changing identity of women and what society defines them to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Smile</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> may not have any particularly bubbly or high-energy tracks that you might’ve seen in Perry’s older albums, it serves as a comfort to listeners during these hard times.

31612	The class will dissect different eras and impacts of hip-hop in the U.S.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Social studies teacher Kenneth Smith is piloting a Hip-Hop History and Culture class at Blair during the 2019-2020 school year. Smith, who grew up in the "golden era" of hip-hop in New York, brainstormed and proposed the class this year after realizing that hip-hop is rarely studied in high schools. "For years, I always integrated some aspect of hip-hop into my [social studies] classes," he said. "I thought to myself, this class and similar classes are taught at colleges all over the country but very few are taught at the high school level." ﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31611"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The class will focus on a variety of topics related to hip-hop, Smith said. From the connections between hip-hop and African-American oral tradition to the adoption of hip-hop in Asia, Africa and Europe, Smith plans to appeal to a variety of student interests and help Blazers dissect the meaning of hip-hop music. "We're also going to look at the socio-political context that created the culture in the Bronx… and look at misogyny in the [hip-hop] culture," Smith added. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith's goal for the class is to take students' enjoyment of hip-hop to the next level. He noticed that many of his students over the years were immersed in hip-hop but did not know about its deeper meaning, roots or implications, and aims to change that through the content he will cover. "For those that are connected to hip-hop, I want them to understand that there is an intellectual component to it. I want them to be able to deconstruct and look critically at the culture," he explained. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith's class has garnered attention on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TheMoCoShow/status/1082612525164834816" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">social media</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and in local news outlets like </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/schools/regions-first-hip-hop-history-and-culture-class-starting-at-blair-high-school/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Bethesda Magazine</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, as well as through a YouTube video he posted explaining the inspiration behind the class and the issues it will focus on. Smith is happy about the reactions to the class so far and said he is not discouraged by the few individuals who are doubtful about the academic value of exploring hip-hop. "I'm pleased with the press response —&nbsp;for the most part, it's been overwhelmingly positive," he said. "There are some adults who have legitimate concerns about hip-hop being taught inside a school, but I think those detractors don't really understand the entirety of the culture." </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"[I'm excited for] the unknown," Smith said of the class. "This is something that's new in Montgomery County… and anything could happen." Despite the unpredictability, Smith hopes he can reach many students with the class and share his passion for the complex history and culture behind hip-hop.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The class code for Hip-Hop History and Culture during the 2019-2020 school year is 2213. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31611
31993	Don't be fooled. The plastic bottle you recycled this morning is sitting in the dumpster	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Reuse, Reduce, Recycle"— the mantra of our elementary school days. The focus used to be on recycling. For decades, the goal was to introduce recycling bins to every state, city and organization, and develop a habit of recycling among Americans. While we've made leaping strides, recycling is no longer a solution. Instead of sitting slack-jawed and helpless, it's time to get active with reusables.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In July, China </span><a href="https://www.magnetmail.net/Actions/email_web_version.cfm?publish=newsletter&amp;user_id=ISRIID&amp;message_id=17167172" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">revised its national solid-waste management law</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, which intends to ban imported solid waste by the end of 2020. China previously sorted through the United States' contaminated mass using low-cost intensive labor. After finding out </span><a href="http://mediaroom.wm.com/the-battle-against-recycling-contamination-is-everyones-battle/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">roughly 25 percent of America's collected recyclables are contaminated</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Chinese officials banned recyclable items, such as mixed paper and plastics in 2018. The task then rested in the hands of American recycling companies, who were reluctant to employ workers when it was far cheaper to buy new plastics and paper.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hundreds of cities and states have shut down their recycling systems, sending this new source of waste to landfills or incinerators instead. While Franklin, NH was once able to break even by selling their recyclables for $6 a ton, the high cost of transfer stations forced the city to end the program. Broadway, VA also suspended its program after recycling prices increased by 63 percent.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">These cities are struggling to make a decision: pay higher rates or poison the planet? Many officials feel guilty of slowly spoiling the environment, but the issue is beyond their control. “We are doing our best to be environmentally responsible, but we can’t afford it,” Franklin city manager Judie Milner says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Montgomery County is finding it tough to recycle, too. "Fees have increased significantly in the last year," says John Meyer, recycling manager of the MCPS School Energy and Recycling Team (SERT). "[They] are continuing to rise due to the ban."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, Meyer and the SERT team are determined to face the trouble head on. "A large amount of cities and counties have reduced or eliminated recycling. As long as the country mandates recycling, MCPS will continue to recycle at its highest standard," Meyer says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the county's optimistic attitude, few options will remain when China sees the 2020 imported waste ban through. Let's review the facts. Landfills are filling up faster than ever with the new inflow of items that were once recycled. While the incarceration of plastic waste products creates energy, it also emits carbon and releases even more mercury and lead than coal plants.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A solution that many are hopeful for is changing the way Americans recycle and eventually reentering the global market for recyclables— meaning no more impostors such as soy-sauce packets, granola bar wrappers and pizza boxes. However, eliminating contaminated recyclables nationwide is implausible, considering there is one contaminated recyclable item for every three clean items. Recycling is a temporary solution reaching the end of its run. It's time to turn our attention to the other two R's, reusing and reducing.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The ultimate solution to plastic pollution and the recycling dilemma is to eliminate dependence on single-use plastics. By investing in substitutes such as reusable straws and bags, we inherently reduce the amount of single-use plastics that are produced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Why reuse? The effects of plastic pollution are twofold.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Marine plastic pollution is, without a doubt, a detriment to our underwater ecosystems. You've seen the photos— turtles with plastic straws in their bloody noses and fish choked by six pack containers. According to the </span><a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/ocean_plastics/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Center for Biological Diversity</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, thousands of animals are choked, cut and poisoned by the plastic debris every year. At current growth rates, plastic is expected to outweigh all of the fish in the sea by 2050.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31992"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moreover, the plastics that are ingested by unsuspecting sea animals in the ocean are the same plastics hiding on dinner plates. Plastic toxins such as lead, cadmium and mercury work their way up the food chain and affect humans as well. 50 years ago, </span><a href="https://www.bu.edu/sustainability/minamata-disease/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">an outbreak in Japan's Minamata Bay killed 1,784 people by mercury poisoning</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. An entire population suffered from memory loss, impaired cognition, physical disability and eventually death.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to </span><a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/trash-free-seas/plastics-in-the-ocean/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Ocean Conservancy</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, eight million metric tons of plastics enter the ocean every single year on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that already circulate our marine environments. While organizations such as Ocean Conservancy and the Surfrider Foundation push for international beach cleanups to relieve our environment, it is everyone's responsibility to limit the amount of plastic entering the ocean in the present and the future.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">How can you reuse and eliminate single-use plastics? Common steps that many have already taken include investing in reusable water bottles and grocery bags. Replace plastic straws with metal or silicone reusable straws and plastic food wrap with reusable containers. Instead of accumulating another cup each time you buy coffee, bring your own cup instead. The possibilities are endless, and individuals and organizations are constantly brainstorming new ways to cut down on our current plastic dependence.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Opponents of sustainable practices rationalize the use single use plastics with their convenience and affordability. However, neither stand up to the test in the long term. One stainless steel water bottle, given the usual care and conditions, will last a decade of consistent usage. On the other hand, buying a 24-count pack of Deer Park plastic bottles for $4.63 may seem cheap at the time of purchase, but the cost accumulates quickly at $266.45 per year at a rate of four bottles per day. In terms of convenience, nothing seems more convenient than lugging at least 26.5 pounds of water to your house every week, does it?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">By boycotting the market for single-use plastics, our actions communicate our wants and needs. As soon as the market for these plastics disappears, so will the corporations that produce them. As companies work toward greater corporate citizenship, it is our responsibility to change the nature of consumerism in ways that benefit the environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many have coined the movement toward limiting single-use plastics with additions to the original adage, such as "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Repair, Refuse." Regardless of the name, the basic principle remains the same: transitioning to sustainable practices is the only sustainable fix for saving our planet.</span></p>	31992
32065	The film expertly combines old favorites with a fresh storyline	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fans of the British TV series "Downton Abbey" have been eagerly awaiting the film version's release since it was announced in July 2018 and they will be glad to know it doesn't disappoint. The movie reintroduces the eccentric cast of characters in a new, suspenseful story complete with royal fiascos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film opens as the aristocratic Crawley family receives news that King George V (Simon Jones) and Queen Mary (Geraldine James) will be coming to stay with them at Downton Abbey while passing through Yorkshire. The Crawleys and their staff go into a flurry of activity to prepare for the royal family's arrival, but are dejected to hear that the king and queen will be bringing their own servants with them. When the royal staff arrive, conflict ensues as they attempt to domineer the Downton servants. Frustrated, Downton's housemaid Anna Bates (Joanne Froggatt) leads the servants in a risky plot to defend Downton's honor.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32064"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Meanwhile, other tensions run high. Downton butler Thomas Barrow (Robert James-Collier) is upset when he is replaced by senior butler Carson (Jim Carter), and later faces mixed emotions about his sexuality after falling for the king's valet. When Lady Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith) reunites with her estranged relative — the queen's lady-in-waiting Maud Bagshaw (Imelda Staunton) — they rekindle old arguments about heirship. The Crawley's son-in-law Tom Branson (Allen Leech) is unknowingly caught up in plans to assassinate the king. The Crawleys and their servants desperately try to resolve their issues while simultaneously hosting the royals.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"Downton Abbey" avoids the all-too-familiar flop that often accompanies a TV series revival, largely due to its recognizable and talented actors. Michelle Dockery's no-nonsense performance as Lady Mary Talbot contrasts with the sarcastic wit Smith brings to Lady Violet's character. All the romantic pairs introduced in the film —&nbsp;Barrow and Richard Ellis (Max Brown) and Branson and Lucy Smith (Tuppence Middleton), along with others — have impeccable chemistry that keeps viewers interested. Carter's interpretation of Carson brings slight differences, namely a more laid-back character, but his unchanged fatherly disposition provides fond memories of the TV series.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Director Michael Engler and writer Julian Fellowes embody the spirit of the 20th century United Kingdom well. From strategic shots of railroads and Abbey itself to the humorous banter between Lady Violet and the Crawleys, the film is an engaging, albeit slightly dramatized, retelling of life for British nobles. Fellowes includes ample lighthearted scenes in the script, including a side-splitting series of events featuring the awkward butler Joseph Molesley (Kevin Doyle) at the royal dinner, to offset the darker concepts such as violence, theft, and relationship problems discussed throughout the film.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The movie's cinematography and score are its crowning touches. Cinematographer Ben Smithard outdoes himself with grandiose shots of the English countryside and Downton's elaborately-decorated rooms. The featured music, which includes everything from "God Save the Queen" to lively 20th century jazz to the recognizable "Downton Abbey" piano theme, enthralls audiences and takes them on a rollercoaster of emotions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"Downton Abbey's" one downfall comes in its lack of accessibility to those who were not previously fans of the franchise. The plot delves directly into the story of the king and queen's visit, not bothering to introduce the backstories of any characters or clearly define relationships. Those who don't know that Branson's wife Cybil Crawley died in childbirth during the TV series, for example, may have a hard time discerning the role that his new love interest Lucy plays in his life. However, this can be quickly remedied by watching a couple episodes of the series or reading up on the characters' previous lives.

31912	How the ACES program helps Blazers prepare for the future	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The achievement gap has been a long-standing problem, but the Achieving Collegiate Excellence and Success (ACES) program attempts to narrow that gap. Blair currently has 120 students in the county-wide program to help high schoolers and future college students who may not have as many opportunities to find information about colleges through workshops and other resources.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The program starts with a summer program to help familiarize students with the process. As the program continues through the summer after sophomore year and beyond, Blazers meet up with ACES coaches to discuss the next steps such as college visits and scholarships.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31911"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rising junior ACES students spend two weeks at their nearest Montgomery College campus attending workshops on subjects such as the SAT and financial aid. Activities also include team-building exercises to help acquaint students with each other. "There's academics involved, but we do team building, because we also want students to get to know one another. We want them to have fun," ACES coach Jeanette Rojas says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rising seniors participate a more intense program at one of the Universities of Shady Grove. Blazers spend two-and-a-half days in workshops on professionalism, leadership and career exploration. There is also a job fair where students can explore career options, talk to professionals and participate in activities simulating real-life situations in those careers. "It's a little bit more hands on, which the students really enjoy," Rojas says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the school year, students attend more workshops and ACES meetings to stay informed on various scholarship and financial aid opportunities. Students also get materials such as SAT prep books for free. In addition, students go on college visits, with three tours to different colleges this past year.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Coaches hopes these visits help inspire students who may not have been thinking about college to give the idea a second chance. "If [students are] first-generation, they haven't even been to a college campus, and they may not see themselves as a college student. But nowadays when we go to colleges like Montgomery College, Maryland, Towson, they see kids that look like themselves and that helps motivate them, because they can envision themselves as a college student," Rojas said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The amount of time a student spends with his or her ACES coach varies. Students aren't required to meet with their coaches, but it is strongly recommended they do so. While some may visit on a weekly basis, it is not mandatory. Students with busy schedules can also use the GroupMe app to check for information the ACES program provides. "I don't have time to go to the office because my schedule is really full, but we get notifications on the GroupMe app about field trips or if we need to sign up for anything, they provide a lot of aid with anything we need,"&nbsp;junior Lauren Lim Chee Yung explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the program does encourage students to enter the college level ACES program and spend two years at Montgomery College and two years at the Universities of Shady Grove, ACES students are free to pursue other options past high school.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From helping Blair families with filling out tax forms to providing free legal services, ACES coaches help students in a variety of ways The goal of ACES coaches is to help students figure out their future."We get very involved with our caseload and with our students to help them figure out what they're going to do after high school," Rojas says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Currently, Blair does not have an ACES coach, as the previous one left this past winter. To fill this gap, Rockville High ACES coach Jeanette Rojas and Springville High ACES coach Monica Burgos have been visiting Blair weekly.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some ACES students feel a bit less familiar with these new coaches. Students haven't had the chance to get to know their current ACES coaches as well as their previous one and aren't as close to the new coaches yet. "I was really close to Mr. Medrano, and he helped me out a lot. I don't really know the new ACES coaches, so I don't feel as comfortable talking to them," junior Christian Panihua explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The ACES program has come a long way in its mission to inform students about how to navigate life beyond high school, whether it be in college or down another path. While the current ACES coaches at Blair may be less familiar with students, as they continue to help Blazers take their next step, the future of ACES looks bright.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31911
33104	The Silver Chips Editorial Board is proud to release this endorsement for the primary in the race for the At-Large seat on the Board of Education	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Silver Chips Editorial Board is proud to endorse </span><a href="https://www.lynne4students.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Lynne Harris</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> for the open at-large seat on the Montgomery County Board of Education. Ms. Harris’ deep knowledge of the school system, unique prioritization of students, and diverse career experiences make her the ideal choice for students and families as MCPS recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p><h3><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Experience begets action</strong></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Of the candidates on the ballot, Ms. Harris has the most thorough understanding of our school system. She most recently served as president of the Montgomery County Council of PTAs, overseeing an organization of 45,000 volunteers, and she has taught Medical Science with Clinical Applications at Thomas Edison High School of Technology for the last four years.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33100"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the eight-member Board of Education develops and implements MCPS’ response to the pandemic, Ms. Harris’ wide breadth of professional experience will be invaluable: In her career, Ms. Harris has worked as a grant coordinator at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a lawyer at the U.S. Department of Justice, and as an attorney advisor at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.﻿</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We asked all four candidates about MCPS' response to COVID-19. </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Silver_Chips/status/1261809281273397250?s=20" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>View their answers on our Twitter page</em></a><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</em></p><p><span style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though he does not have as much experience in MCPS as Ms. Harris, fellow candidate </span><a href="http://sunildasgupta.com/" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Sunil Dasgupta</a><span style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, a professor at UMBC, would serve as a suitable Board member. Dr. Dasgupta’s time as Chair of the MCCPTA's Health and Wellness Committee suggests that he will pay close attention to student wellness as we recover from the covid-19 pandemic, which will be crucial.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, we have some concerns regarding Dr. Dasgupta’s platform.</span></p><h3><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Budget shortfalls</strong></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We believe that Dr. Dasgupta’s plan to take MCPS through the impending budget crisis is unlikely to succeed. In short, Dr. Dasgupta proposes better school utilization, which would reduce the need to build additions to schools and to rent portables.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While this plan is sound—economically, environmentally, and logically—in the long term, we fear that it will yield no returns in the near future. To better manage school utilization, MCPS would have to implement boundary changes, and because of the strength of the opposition to MCPS’ current boundary study, this Editorial Board doubts that the Board of Education would be able and willing to pass Dr. Dasgupta’s proposal.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33101"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ms. Harris, on the other hand, detailed clear, immediate steps she would take to decrease budgetary pressure. “There were some programs that we were targeted to scale up, but I think we would pause on things like more innovative school calendar schools, more two-way immersion schools, [and]… the expansion of the IB magnets to eight new sites,” which would also give MCPS a much-needed opportunity to conduct a quality assurance audit, Ms. Harris said.</span></p><p>This school system will need to take strong, early action to prevent long-term budget constraints. We believe that Ms. Harris is best-positioned to push the Board toward sensible plans.</p><p><em style="background-color: initial;">We asked all four candidates about the budget.</em><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/2/blog/post/edit/3035589981066893120/5158756615645615779#" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: black;"><em> </em></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/2/blog/post/edit/3035589981066893120/5158756615645615779#" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>View their answers on our Twitter page</em></a><em style="background-color: initial;">.</em></p><h3><strong>Staff discipline</strong></h3><p>An important factor in our decision was the answer to this question:</p><p><em style="background-color: transparent;">On Oct. 31, 2018, </em><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/schools/damascus-high-rape-victims-file-lawsuit-over-football-related-sexual-assaults/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>four students were raped with a broomstick in the Damascus High School football locker room</em></a><em style="background-color: transparent;">.

How would you discipline teachers and school staff who are involved in negligence?</em></p><p>Ms. Harris immediately called out the principal and administrators’ union (Montgomery County Association of Administrators and Principals) and the teachers’ union (Montgomery County Education Association).</p><p>“It goes to the contracts we have with MCAAP and MCEA and what they’ve been able to negotiate over the years,” Ms. Harris said. “I have multiple concerns and issues with the contracts—and I’m saying that as a teacher. When we’re talking about students, and we’re talking about criminal law, [it should be] suspension without pay immediately. I have real problems with those [administrators] still being in the positions they’re in.</p><p>“None of these people were new,” Ms. Harris added. “Casey Crouse had been a principal in this system for eight years. That should have been cause, in my mind, for immediately being dismissed, because there is no excuse.”</p><p><span style="background-color: initial;">The only other candidate to directly suggest the dismissal of negligent school staff was Jay Guan. Dr. Dasgupta focused on fostering a culture of reporting these incidents immediately to the police, as the law requires, while Stephen Austin called for the administrators to be “held accountable” without specifics.</span></p><p>While Mr. Guan, Dr. Dasgupta, and Mr. Austin are not wrong, only Ms. Harris spoke in detail how the negligent Damascus administrators should have been disciplined and rightly tied MCPS’ weak response to its contracts with the unions. We appreciate her willingness to immediately and unequivocally call out those at fault, from the Damascus staff to the unions protecting them.</p><p><em style="background-color: initial;">We asked all four candidates about staff discipline after Damascus.</em><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/2/blog/post/edit/3035589981066893120/5158756615645615779#" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: black;"><em> </em></a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/2/blog/post/edit/3035589981066893120/5158756615645615779#" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>View their answers on our Twitter page</em></a><em style="background-color: initial;">.</em></p><h3><strong>A student-centered platform</strong></h3><p>Another testament to Ms. Harris’ student-centered platform is her plethora of student endorsements, including MoCo Students for Change, MoCo Students on Climate, and former Student Members of the Board Ananya Tadikonda, Matt Post, Eric Guerci, and Sebastian Johnson.

It’s between 2 candidates hand-picked by MCPS.” Mr. Austin told this Editorial Board that he was referring to the Nomination Convention, where student delegates from each school—not MCPS—vote for the two candidates for the general election, and acknowledged that “I shouldn’t have been so flippant with the way I explained that."</span></p><p>However, Mr. Austin argued that a SMOB should not chair a Board committee because they only serve one year and that any impactful legislation the SMOB proposes ought to have an “adult sponsor.” This Editorial Board strongly disagrees. Though most only serve for one year, SMOBs often advocate for the same policies as their predecessors. This continuity proves the importance of a full-fledged Board member who answers directly to us students.</p><p>We believe that Mr. Austin’s expertise as a finance professional would help the Board manage impending budgetary difficulties, but his lack of MCPS-specific experience, his opposition to the boundary study, and his group’s run-ins with students are too much to overlook.</p><h3><strong>A promising future</strong></h3><p><a href="https://www.jayguan4boe.com/" target="_blank" style="background-color: initial; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Jay Guan</a><span style="background-color: initial;">, an aerospace engineer who works with the Federal Aviation Agency and leads the race in monetary contributions, is a promising candidate. His focus on the approaching fourth industrial revolution is certainly important, as are his calls for deeper MCPS-family connections in immigrant communities.</span></p><p>However, this Editorial Board feels that Mr. Guan is underprepared for a Board seat at this stage. His time volunteering with MCPS groups includes only a handful of advisory committees, unlike Ms. Harris’ time in leadership and as a teacher.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33103"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">The vast majority of </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K8pYTM9zW1zxcamgEwHE3MCYd3yJcZo6/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Mr. Guan’s monetary support</a><span style="background-color: transparent;"> comes from the Asian-American community. While we applaud Mr. Guan’s efforts to pave a path for Asian-American involvement in leadership, we believe he needs to develop a wider support base. Further, he has received relatively few endorsements from local leaders, which suggests that he has yet to develop strong connections in Montgomery County government. With more experience under his belt, Mr. Guan may well be the candidate to beat in the coming years.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>About our endorsement process</strong></h3><p>This Editorial Board invited the four leading candidates—Mr. Guan, Mr. Austin, Dr. Dasgupta, and Ms. Harris—for 40-minute video interviews. Mr. Guan, Mr. Austin, and Dr. Dasgupta lead the race in donations; Ms. Harris, who stopped taking donations in early March, leads the race in notable endorsements.

32223	SMOB Nate Tinbite’s resolution passed in Board of Education meeting	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the Montgomery County Board of Education meeting on Oct. 8, student member of the board (SMOB) Nate Tinbite’s high-school athletics proposal passed. The resolution, a path for student-athletes to receive physical education (P.E.) credit through school sports teams, is set to resurface in Feb. 2020 when the board considers options for its implementation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Currently, student-athletes are expected to complete physical education courses even while they are participating in school-sponsored sports. For many student-athletes, this requirement is seen as unnecessary and repetitive. “I aim to alleviate the hours of redundant stress for student-athletes,”&nbsp;Tinbite said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Board’s passing vote does not automatically implement the credit policy, but mandates that current Superintendent Dr. Jack R. Smith bring forward strategies for approaching the distribution of P.E. credits to the board by their February meeting.“My resolution directs the superintendent to come back to the board on how to award the athletes with a semester of P.E. as opposed to a full year. It is our goal to find an option that works,” Tinbite stated.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While Maryland law mandates that students obtain half a P.E. credit to graduate, Montgomery County requires students to earn a full credit for graduation. This enables the county to expand on how students can receive the extra required half-credit. “Because MCPS provides P.E. and athletics, there was mobility between state and county requirements,” says Tinbite.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32222"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The resolution’s implementation would be wide-reaching, providing MCPS' 23,000 student athletes a chance to earn half of their required physical education credits without taking a class.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The idea for student-athletes to receive physical education credits has been brought before the board by past SMOB's. During his 2015-2016 term, former SMOB Eric Guerci proposed a much more specific approach to the case of P.E. credits and athletics which was rejected by the board.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This proposal marks the beginning of what Tinbite looks to complete during his term. “I wanted to get this done early on, [as there are] lots of bigger projects later in the year such as bridging the divides between schools. There is much more to consider with the budget season coming up,” he explains.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32222
31767	Remarkable women in history and their accomplishments	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We often appreciate the contributions of famous scientists such as Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and Thomas Edison. But it’s also important to reflect on the accomplishments of scientists from underrepresented populations who overcame several obstacles to achieve extraordinary feats. As we're reflecting back on Black History Month and coming full swing into Women's History Month, we’ve gathered information about the achievements of three remarkable African American women in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31766"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Mae Jemison</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From a doctor to an astronaut, Mae Jemison elected an unconventional path to become the first African American in space. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jemison received a Bachelor of Science degree at Stanford, majoring in Chemical Engineering. Afterward, she studied at Cornell University Medical College and received her M.D. in 1981. Shortly after, she began working as a Peace Corps medical officer while simultaneously performing medical research. Inspired by Star Trek’s Lieutenant Uhura, played by African-American actress Nichelle Nichols, Jemison then decided to apply to NASA’s competitive training program and was selected to be one of 15 candidates from over 2,000 applications. After over a year of training, Jemison earned the title of science mission specialist, responsible for scientific experiments onboard the space shuttle.

Majoring in mathematics and French, Johnson soon became a teacher in Virginia. Shortly after, Johnson received the unique opportunity to be one of the first three African American students in a graduate program at West Virginia University. Following her education, she began working at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)’s West Area Computing unit, performing complex calculations for engineers in the program. Although NACA was segregated at the time, in 1958, NACA was incorporated into NASA, which prohibited segregation. As part of the Space Task Group at NASA, Johnson co-authored over 25 research reports and crunched numbers for trajectories, launch windows and other calculations by hand, which significantly contributed to John Glenn’s Friendship 7 mission and both the Apollo Moon and Space Shuttle programs.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jewel Plummer Cobb</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite facing racial discrimination at a young age, Jewel Plummer Cobb’s spirit of perseverance allowed her to conduct cutting-edge research in cell biology and oncology.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From a young age, Cobb felt the importance of education; her grandfather was a freed slave who graduated from Howard University in 1898; her father received an M.D. from Rush Medical College after attending Cornell University, and her mother studied at the Sargent School of Physical Training in Cambridge. During her childhood, Cobb pursued a special honors-track program in science, taking biology courses before going on to study at the University of Michigan in 1941. As a black woman, Cobb was not allowed to live in a dorm, and many popular restaurants refused to serve her, isolating her from her fellow students. After transferring to Talladega College and receiving support from her mentors, Cobb graduated in two years with a degree in biology before earning her master’s in 1947 and doctorate in 1950 in cell biology at NYU. Since graduating, Cobb has conducted groundbreaking research in the relationship between melanin and skin cancer, discovering that methotrexate effectively treats skin and lung cancer. Methotrexate is still used in chemotherapy today. In addition to her research, Cobb also served as a biology professor at Sarah Lawrence college, dean of three additional universities, and even president of California State University at Fullerton. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From crunching complex calculations by hand to becoming the first African American female in space, it’s remarkable to imagine the courage these women possessed and the legacy they left behind in inspiring countless black female scientists today. In recognizing the accomplishments of these scientists in history, we can look towards the future with high hopes that similarly impressive accomplishments are soon to come.</span></p>	31766

Senior officer Cindy Depenyou was particularly excited to run the talent show. "I was very active about making the talent show happen because I've always dreamed of having a Blair talent show. We started planning it when the club started back up," Depenyou says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32676"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Girl Up has raised money for charities through bake sales and bracelet fundraisers but feels it is important to give back to the Blair community through these events. Club sponsor Alison Russell wants to find a way to both raise money for the club's causes as well as actively engage the school. "With fundraisers, people come by but it doesn't necessarily give back to the school. This seemed like a good way to raise awareness for the club and get more people throughout the school involved," Russell says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Girl Up is hoping to give a stage for Blazers who have unconventional talents that might get a chance to shine in the settings of Blair's Open Mic or in the plays and musicals. "What I want is just different, diverse talents. I want to see cool, creative stuff that you don't really see. We accept anything, all sorts of talents, we just want people to come out and express themselves," Depenyou says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The club is accepting all types of acts, from singers and dancers to contortionists and kazoo players. The group also wants to emphasize that all students are welcome to enter, regardless of gender. Auditions for the talent show will be continuing this week and students interested can sign up with </span><a href="http://tinyurl.com/mbhstalent" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">this link</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Advertisements for the talent show have varied through word of mouth, Infoflow announcements and Instagram posts. Girl Up members want to make sure that Blazers are aware of and encouraged to enter the competition. Junior club member Liv Dussere understands that many Blazers may not pay attention to some forms of the club's advertising and wants to make sure students find out about the event. "We wanted to publicize on as many different platforms as possible, so we thought that social media would also be a good way to reach our students," Dussere explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The prizes for the winners of the talent show are also intended to reel in curious students who may want to be in the show. The first-place prize will be a 30 dollar Visa gift card, while the second-place winner will get a 15 dollar Visa gift card. Club members went through deliberations on what type of gift card would be given but ultimately settled on the Visa gift cards since students will be able to buy whatever they choose and not be boxed in by a gift card that can only be redeemed at one store.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While some of those who enter the talent show will be motivated by the prize money, others are entering to support the Girl Up club itself. Senior Caitlyn Fort</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">é knows a few Girl Up members and feels it is important to help the club. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"I thought it would be fun and my friends encouraged me to do it because they're in Girl Up and I want to support Girl Up," Fort</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">é</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> says, planning to enter the talent show. Others want to show their talent in front of a crowd. Senior Alex Browning does not typically get a chance to show her passion for dancing and is looking forward to the talent show. "It's exciting because I can show off a talent that I don't show off often so it's nice to perform," Browning says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The club will be selling tickets for five dollars without a student ID and three dollars for those with a student ID. Members will also be selling baked goods and bracelets. The proceeds will be going to a charity helping women and girls. "We're going to be donating the proceeds to a nonprofit organization that supports women, which is kind of the base of our club, advocating for women's rights and just supporting women," Depenyou says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ultimately, the club hopes that Blazers will enjoy the event and learn more about the outreach Girl Up does. "I'd like it to be a fun way to interact with the Blair community and for a lot of people at Blair to come together and just have a good time. But I also hope that people can feel good about themselves for helping out whatever charity we decide to donate to," Dussere says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Those involved in Girl Up look forward to this talent show becoming the first of many in the coming years. "I hope that over time, this will be an institution at Blair where students can have another opportunity to show off all the great things students do," Russell says.&nbsp;</span></p>	32676
31807	Blair and Bethesda Chevy-Chase High School collaborated to create a pop-up museum	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31806"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During fifth period, Blair's film studio buzzes with activity as media teacher George Mayo critiques junior Haili Bruckner's film. Abstract clips of flowers and dancers accompanied by layered audio flash past on the screen. Just a few feet away, juniors Siana Park-Pearson and Elizabeth Olsson edit a series of video clips featuring students sitting in front of a green screen. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bruckner, Park-Pearson and Olsson are just a few of the students creating products for the Toxicity Project, a pop-up museum sponsored by Bethesda-Chevy Chase (B-CC) High School teacher David Lopilato. B-CC students created a pop-up exhibit last year about the teenage experience, called the Museum of the Contemporary American Teen, which was "met with a lot of success," according to Lopilato. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lopilato wanted to create a similar project this year and decided to explore the toxic situations teens often face. "[The word toxicity] just kept coming up in terms of masculinity, in terms of gun violence, in terms of stress and in terms of competitiveness. The dominant narrative is that teens have it made today as compared to in the past, but this exhibit challenges that notion," he explains. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brucker and her partner, junior Maria Cannon, are using film to explore the toxicity of gender as a limiting concept in individuals' lives. Rather than focusing their video on the traditional subject of toxic masculinity, Bruckner and Cannon decided to take a different angle inspired by what they had seen around them (and the lack thereof) regarding gender norms. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"We wanted to look more in depth at how enforcing a gender and living your life as a specific gender can be a toxic experience whether it's a more masculine or more feminine gender," Cannon explains. "We just used what we knew and what we had experienced… and shaped a story," Bruckner adds. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bruckner and Cannon also drew from personal experiences to inspire their film's subject. "I'm queer, and Haili's also queer… I think it's much more common now for queer people who are lesbian or gay to think about how their queerness extends to their gender as well as their sexuality," Cannon elaborates. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Park-Pearson and Olsson are using their film to highlight an equally prominent subject —&nbsp;high school stress. "We both are very stressed," Park-Pearson laughs. "When we were introduced to the Toxicity Project by Mr. Lopilato and Mr. Mayo, I thought this was a very relatable topic." She and Olsson decided to take a narrative angle with their film, piecing together short clips of students discussing their experiences with stress. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Confronting the complex themes in their film has been a challenging experience for Park-Pearson and Olsson, and they find it ironic that attempting to discuss the dangers of stress on teens has actually stirred up stress in their own lives. "Because we're very personally connected with the issue, it can be a little emotional when we're working on the project, to hear these incredibly depressing metaphors and descriptions of stress… It kind of just reminds me of how stressed I am," Olsson admits. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While Blair students work on their films, students at B-CC are creating different projects for the pop-up. Several individuals collaborated to create an interactive Escape Room about privilege in education. Senior Néa Ranganathan is working with her IB Social Anthropology classmates Virginia Brown, James Pfaff and Gloria Karekezi to create a life-size sculpture called the "Bethesda Bubble." </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The sculpture, which explores the differences between the Bethesda community and other areas in Montgomery County, will contain food and clothing items that investigate stereotypes and play off the contrast of dark and light themes. "We're hoping to see the discrepancies between what people think internally in our school versus what people think outside. We hope that when people see [the project], they'll understand that we're living in this bubble in Bethesda," Ranganathan says. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Other students at B-CC are exploring topics including the experiences of gender fluid students who face pressure to conform and the recent college admissions scandal. Their projects, which use everything from security cameras to cardboard cutouts, are "interactive, sometimes amusing and sometimes brutally in your face," according to Lopilato.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The technicalities of the Toxicity Project have been proved difficult, especially for the Blair filmmakers who are foraying into new territory with the experimental styles they are using. Because of the lack of scripting and planning, Bruckner and Cannon felt slightly lost at the beginning of their process. "With this film, it's like you have a piece of fabric and you're pulling it to fit a table in a very certain way. It's a lot of working it without really knowing how it's going to look in the end," Cannon explains. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Olsson and Park-Pearson faced a similar situation with their product. "We had no clue what the film would be like or what themes it would focus on before we did all our interviews," Olsson echoes. "It's like a reversal of what we usually do." </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ultimately, however, the experience has been rewarding for both B-CC and Blair students. Ranganathan explains that creating the bubble helped her self-reflect. "I'm starting to see how I might be part of the Bethesda bubble… and take for granted some of the opportunities that we have at this school," she explains. Park-Pearson enjoyed finding solidarity with other students through interviews. "For me, the most interesting part was hearing all those different metaphors for what stress feels like or hearing those different things that people are stressed about," Park-Pearson says. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The creators' ultimate goal? Broadening perspectives and spreading comfort. Bruckner and Cannon want to push those who don't normally evaluate gender to do so. "When people see our video, we want them to be exposed to something that they may not have really explored… and think about how gender plays into their own life," Bruckner says. Ranganathan hopes that her team's sculpture decreases polarization between students from different walks of life across the county. Park-Pearson and Olsson would like to encourage others to open up and understand that "[stress] is something that is happening to millions of kids." </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Acknowledged in almost every sector of society and even being named the 2018 </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/16/oxford-english-dictionary-2018-toxic/2023517002/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">word of the year</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, toxicity is largely being recognized as a legitimate problem. Through their involvement in the Toxicity Project, this group of Montgomery County teens is doing far more than just recognizing it. They're fighting it by fostering conversations. "I think… the fact that we always try to push these hard conversations away [is a big part of the toxicity problem]," says Ranganathan. "If we're just a little more open, it would help with the toxicity." </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Toxicity Project will be on display April 26 through April 28 in the former Bank of America building on Wisconsin Ave. in Downtown Bethesda. The opening ceremony will take place at 6 p.m. on April 26, and Blair students will showcase their films at 8 p.m.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31806

The endorsement and opinion of the Editorial Board are separate from Silver Chips’ fact-driven and balanced news coverage and hold no sway in the content nor tone of Silver Chips’ articles.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From maintaining schools, to distributing food, to teaching on Zoom, MCPS employees are continuously going above and beyond during this pandemic. Now, MCPS is hanging them out to dry.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Oct. 8, MCPS announced that it will increase the amount that employees pay toward their healthcare by an average of 10 percent starting in January and also proposed withholding their cost of living adjustments. Amid a global crisis when these employees have been working tirelessly and bravely, this change—an effective pay cut—is inexcusable.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is even more disheartening when we consider that Montgomery County has laudably agreed to grant hazard pay to other non-public school employees—such as first responders and prison correction workers. Just like those other public employees who have been working on the frontlines, employees in the public schools system are essential workers, and they must be treated that way.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">They have been to schools to help disinfect facilities and to prepare and distribute food to students. They have distributed thousands of Chromebooks and school supplies in order to make virtual learning possible and more equitable. And yet MCPS is slashing the pay for those who are putting their heart and soul into their work.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33156"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The people working from school buildings are putting their lives on the line every day. Despite Governor Larry Hogan touting Maryland’s COVID-19 metrics, the average number of new cases per day is even higher now than it was in June, during the so-called “peak” of the pandemic.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Furthermore, during a Board of Education meeting on Oct. 6, Associate Superintendent of Operations Essie McGuire confirmed that 79 MCPS employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and nine school buildings have already closed due to cases, with more positive tests and school closings every week—take Bradley Hills Elementary School, which is completely closed until Oct. 23 due to four positive tests last week, or Northwood, where meal distribution temporarily moved to a mobile delivery truck due to a kitchen staff member’s diagnosis, also last week.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To protect staff against the virus, MCPS said they would make kits of personal protective equipment (PPE) available to all employees, including face masks. Yet they announced that N95 respirators would not be available to all employees and that many would instead receive cloth and disposable masks, which don’t qualify as PPE according to the Centers for Disease Control. According to McGuire, MCPS is still working with the Office of Special Education to determine what additional PPE is required for staff working in-person with students in special needs programs even though we are more than a month into the school year.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is disappointing to see so many holes in the county’s reopening plan, which was approved by the state government in mid-August. Since then, Hogan has repeatedly pushed for hastened school reopenings, citing his confidence in the state’s preparation. Evidently, his confidence is misguided.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In an email sent to employees following the Oct. 8 announcement, MCPS stated that they contacted all three unions representing employees in MCPS and discussed the premium increases in depth with the associations. However, the Montgomery County Education Association wrote in a statement to members that “the decision to raise healthcare costs is one that MCPS made on its own.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All three unions strongly oppose these changes. As compensation, MCPS compromised by offering a premium holiday for the first pay period in January, meaning there will be no healthcare premium for a single paycheck. But this one-time “holiday” does nothing to offset the loss of income that employees will experience in the following months.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Transparency is key, especially during the convoluted and trying times we find ourselves in, and yet the concerns of the relevant parties are being ignored. “It illustrates some of the issues that we have with MCPS decision making being very far from transparent with the communities that are most impacted by [these] decisions,” Lynne Harris, who is running for the At-Large seat on the Board of Education and was endorsed by the Editorial Board last spring, said in an interview with Silver Chips.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To give employees fair compensation, MCPS must not increase healthcare costs and must instead give their employees the same hazard pay as other county employees. There is no justification for this inequity.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Public school employees, too, are essential.</span></p>	33156
31490	The Blazers attempt to close the Gladiators' wide lead	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair's girls varsity basketball team (1-3) narrowly lost to the Northwood Gladiators (1-4) with a score of 42-48 on Thursday night. Although the Gladiators had a large lead throughout most of the game, the Blazers fought hard in the last quarter to close the gap.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The game was energy charged from the start, with a foul by Northwood four seconds in. Unfortunately, the Blazers failed to capitalize on their free throws, allowing their opponents to grab the ball off the rebound and score a two-pointer. After the ball was knocked out of bounds by Northwood, the Blazers took possession of the ball. Successfully fending off Northwood's defense, junior forward Adia Keene scored a basket and evened up the score to 2-2. Hard passes and quick steals off the rebound let Northwood score two successive baskets.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A foul this time by the Blazers gave Northwood another point on the board to pull ahead by 2-7. After sophomore guard Kate Hildebrant scored a two-pointer, the Gladiators attempted a shot that was successfully blocked by freshman point guard Emily Liu. Blair was fouled for traveling, handing over the ball to Northwood. Following a display of great teamwork and coordinated plays, the opponents scored another two points.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31494"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair followed up with two successive baskets, tying up the score to 8-9. Another foul by Blair allowed Northwood a successful free throw. After driving the ball quickly up the court, the Gladiators scored another two baskets. With less than two minutes left in the quarter, Blair coach Amy Ferguson called a time-out to discuss defensive strategies. However, the Blazers were unable to prevent Northwood from scoring twice more within the next minute. A traveling foul by Blair kept the ball in Northwood's possession. The Blazers failed to capitalize on the remaining time and ended the first quarter down 8-18.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the second quarter, Blair matched Northwood goal for goal and slightly narrowed the gap. For the first four minutes, the two teams battled for possession and neither scored a basket. A foul by Blair allowed Northwood to score a free throw. The Blazers fought back with a vengeance, with Liu and Keene each scoring a two-pointer. Liu then successfully made two free throws and tightened the score to 14-19.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After Blair threw in the ball, the Gladiators stepped in and intercepted the ball. However, Blair managed to recover it and junior point guard Zoe Abramson scored. Following a time-out, Northwood put high pressure on Blair offense and cornered the Blazers in order to steal the ball. They scored three baskets and closed the first half with a wide lead over Blair of 16-25.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Northwood pulled further ahead of Blair during the third quarter by capitalizing on free throws when Blair failed to. The quarter began with two immediate baskets by the Blazers, but Northwood gained possession off the rebound of Keene's missed shot. The Gladiators then fouled Keene and Liu, who both missed their free throws. Later, a foul on Blair's part gave Northwood two free throws, which they successfully both made.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After Northwood matched a Blair basket with three of their own, the score was 22-35. A foul by Northwood awarded Blair two more free throws, which were taken by sophomore center Peyton Martin. She successfully made one of the baskets. Northwood scored again and a pushing foul by frustrated Blazers allowed the Gladiators to score two more points on free throws. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With one minute left in the third quarter, Northwood committed yet another foul. Liu scored only one of the free throws, leaving the Blazers behind 24-39. The quarter ended with a basket by sophomore point guard Yinka Scott with ten seconds on the clock, leaving the score at 26-39.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the fourth quarter, the Blazers fought valiantly to catch up to the Gladiators but ultimately failed. Northwood scored the first three-pointer of the game and then proceeded to foul the Blazers. Hildebrandt, who took the free throws, successfully made both shots. A traveling error on Blair's part caused a turnover when the Northwood coach called a time-out.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The game resumed with six minutes left on clock. In the next three minutes, the Blazers scored three more baskets and after Hildebrandt scored a three-pointer, brought the score to 37-42. The Blazers held strong against Northwood's offense and prevented them from scoring until the last minute of the game. A foul on both teams' part brought the score to 40-45, with a narrowing lead for Northwood.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As time was running out, Northwood capitalized on breakaways to score. Blair retaliated with a basket of their own, but could not edge out the Gladiators. In the last 30 seconds of the game, the Blazers committed another foul, giving Northwood a last free score to finalize the score at 42-48.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although the Blazers got off to a rough start, they made a strong effort in the last quarter to take back the match. "This was a rough game for us. We came out a little flat-footed; the team wasn't making smart passes and there were too many turnovers. However, we made a valiant effort in the end in an attempt to come back from the 16-point deficit," Ferguson said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, January 11th against the Springbrook Blue Devils at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	31494

They began with a record of 19-31, which is the worst start of any team that's gone on to win the World Series, according to the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/10/31/crazy-stats-that-define-nationals-world-series-title/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Washington Post</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. However, their season quickly improved from there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">They ended the regular season as number one in the wild card standings. They defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League wild card game to advance to the National League Division Series, where they beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in five. The Nats then swept the St. Louis Cardinals in four games to play in the World Series.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Nats looked as if they were going to easily defeat the Astros after they won the first two games in Houston. However, that quickly took a turn when they lost the next three games, all at home. Things were looking rough for the Nats going into Game 6, but they managed to pull out the win with Stephen Strasburg pitching.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Game 7 was a winner-take-all match, and it looked like the Astros were going to take it going into the seventh inning, until Anthony Rendon and Howie Kendrick both hit home runs to give the Nats a one-run lead. They continued to pull away in the eighth and ninth innings to win 6-2.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It was the first World Series win in the Nationals' franchise history, though not the first for a D.C. baseball team. The Homestead Grays, a Washington-based African-American segregated baseball team, won it in 1924.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">D.C. fans were thrilled on Wednesday night, and their reactions to pitcher Daniel Hudson's strikeout to end the game were quite "bryceless." There was a parade celebrating the Nats' victory on Saturday, Nov. 2 that began at 2 p.m. near the Washington Monument and went down Constitution Ave. for a rally at 3:30 p.m. at the intersection of Pennsylvania Ave. and Third St. NW.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32258"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Bridget Griffith, a Nats fan who attended the parade, thought it was an enjoyable experience and was happy that the Nats' finally got a World Series pennant.

33066	On April 24, Governor Larry Hogan announced Maryland’s reopening plan for the COVID-19 pandemic	<p>Governor Larry Hogan announced Maryland’s reopening plan for the COVID-19 pandemic today in an afternoon press conference.&nbsp;</p><p>Hogan said that his administration has been working hard to attain adequate testing, hospital capacity, personal protective equipment (PPE), and staff for contact tracing in order to start the process of recovery. Once these criteria are met and doctors begin to see a decline in the rate of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the reopening plan will begin.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security, lessening social distancing practices would have dangerous repercussions without a consistent decline in the rate of severe cases. “We all want the state to re-open as quickly as it can, but it’s clear that if we opened the state today, we would risk a fast acceleration in the epidemic to very high numbers,” he said at the press conference.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33065"></div><p>The reopening plan consists of three stages. During stage one, officials will lift the stay-at-home order, allow some small businesses to open, permit outdoor activities such as golf and tennis, and authorize hospitals to perform elective surgeries. Local governments will be left to determine protocols for opening libraries and recreational parks.

33262	The Ravens beat the Jaguars for a third win.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Baltimore Ravens (9-5) beat the Jacksonville Jaguars (1-13) on Dec. 20 by a score of 40-14. with the Ravens' offense overwhelming the Jaguars' defense. With their three-game winning streak, the Ravens were looking at a strong lead that's boosting them into the playoffs this year.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A safety and a touchdown by Ravens' receiver Miles Boykin gave the Ravens an early lead of 9-0 in the first quarter. By halftime, the Ravens had a 26-0 lead against the Jaguars after quarterback Lamar Jackson's 11-yard touchdown pass to receiver Dez Bryant. In the third quarter, the Jaguars' quarterback, Gardner Minshew, completed a pass to running back James Robinson in the first possession of the third quarter, diminishing the 26 point lead to a 19 point lead with the score at 26-7 and giving Robinson his 10th touchdown of the season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Ravens, however, responded immediately, bringing back their 26 point lead with a touchdown by Jackson with about 4 minutes left in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars' deficit then increased to 40-7 when Jackson completed a 3-yard pass to Mark Andrews for a touchdown. The Jaguars also bounced back with a touchdown from a pass from Minshew to wide receiver Chris Conley. However, the Jaguars still came out defeated at the end of the fourth quarter, the final score at 40-14.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33261"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the things to notice was that the Jaguar's normal punter, Logan Cooke, actually missed the game because he had gotten sick, so kicker Aldrick Ross punted instead for the first time in his career. Additionally, there were two injuries for the Jaguars: wide receiver Collin Johnson in the first quarter and Robinson in the fourth quarter.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ravens' quarterback Lamar Jackson, the league's Most Valuable Player in 2019, was the star player as he completed 17 of 22 passes and 3 touchdowns. His touchdown in the third quarter basically secured the win for the Ravens just as Jacksonville was starting to gain points.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As for stats, the Jaguars ended the game with a gain of 62 rushing yards with 22 attempts as opposed to the Ravens, who ended the game with 159 rushing yards in 37 attempts. The total yard count ended as 409 for the Ravens and 267 for the Jaguars.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Because of the pandemic, Blair sports have been paused for the health and safety of students and staff. Games have been canceled and most sports practices are virtual. To make up for the lack of Blair sports, many are drawn to pro sports, so don't forget to tune in for the playoffs, which will start on Jan. 9, 2021. Although the Jaguars didn't make it, the Ravens will be playing in the playoffs.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33261
32194	The Blazers defeat Walter Johnson in a nail biting five sets	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair girls’ varsity volleyball team (10-3) defeated the Walter Johnson (WJ) Wildcats (9-5) by a score of 3-2 on Wednesday in their first five-set game of the season. The Blazers lost the first two sets 18-25 and 17-25, but came back to dominate the last three sets. Despite the absence of two key senior players due to injuries, Blair ultimately clinched the win.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32193"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the first two sets, there was an obvious lack of energy and coordination from the Blazers. Missed serves and failed blocks ended with points lost at the net. Coach Chris Liang tried to prevent the Wildcat’s momentum by calling three time-outs. However, WJ was too far ahead and won the first two sets easily.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the beginning of the third set, Blair took an early 4-2 lead. The Blazers seemed to have regained control and were determined not to let go of the game. Shanked passes by WJ widened Blair’s lead to 12-4. However, WJ fought back by pushing at holes in Blair’s defense, and tied up the set at 16-16. In the end, the Blazers managed to edge out the Wildcats and win the set with a score of 25-22.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The fourth set started with aggression from both teams. The set began with possession alternating back and forth, keeping the score close. The Blazers stepped up the offense with crucial back row kills from senior co-captain Olivia Freer, and quickly took the lead. Double touches by WJ and strategic kills by sophomore middle Tori Boggan secured the set for the Blazers 21-8.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With two sets won in a row, the Blazers could not be stopped. They swept the fifth set, 15-9.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Boggan emphasizes that the loss of two senior players definitely impacted Blair’s performance. “We would have won in three sets if our best blocker was not injured. However, I’m happy that we brought it back, and I’m excited for the season going forward,” Boggan said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers play their senior night game against the Churchill Bulldogs at home on Friday, October 25 at 6:00 p.m.</em></p>	32193
32318	Since striking violates Maryland law, educators at Blair show support for education funding in other ways	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This Halloween marked the end of a momentous </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/chicago-cps-teachers-strike.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">teacher strike</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> that lasted 11 days in Chicago, causing chaos for 300,000 students and their families under the public school education system. For two weeks, classes came to a halt as teachers refused to show up in classrooms until Chicago's mayor conceded to higher educator, social worker, nurse and librarian salaries. In response to the recent uproar, educators across the nation have been discussing teachers' working conditions and the plausibility of striking.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32317"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While the system in Montgomery County is far from perfect, striking doesn't seem to be on the horizon, as it is forbidden in teachers' contracts and against Maryland law. "Teacher strikes are illegal in Maryland, and while that sometimes has not stopped teachers, we're not going to strike," Blair math teacher David Stein says. "We're better than a lot of states in terms of state funding, but we have a long way to go."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Stein serves as Blair's representative for the Montgomery County Education Association (MCEA), as well as a member of the Political Action Community Engagement (PACE) committee, where he works on the bargaining team. "We're working on creating a new contract for teachers," Stein says, referring to the annual contract negotiations. "Right now, we're in the process of making proposals."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teachers and negotiators are also pushing for implementation of the </span><a href="https://www.mabe.org/adequacy-funding/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Kirwan Commission</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, a multi-year initiative dedicated to improving the quality of Maryland’s public education system based on the </span><a href="http://ncee.org/what-we-do/center-on-international-education-benchmarking/top-performing-countries/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">best education systems worldwide</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, such as Canada and Finland. The commission hones in on qualitative policy recommendations, guidelines for funding increase and allocation and Maryland laws such as </span><a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?id=sb1030&amp;stab=01&amp;pid=billpage&amp;tab=subject3&amp;ys=2019RS" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Senate Bill 1030</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to provide grants. This policy reform aims to better support preschool and underprivileged students, as well as raise the status of teachers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even if strikes are illegal, Maryland teachers still press for better school funding at annual protest rallies in Annapolis. Most recently, several thousand supporters gathered at the capital in March 2019 for the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-teachers-and-their-boosters-rally-for-increased-education-funding/2019/03/11/30f1c5ca-440f-11e9-aaf8-4512a6fe3439_story.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">"March for Our Schools,"</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> pressuring lawmakers to fill the $3 billion annual funding gap that the Kirwan Commission calls for. While the rally did not result in concrete policy changes, the supporters' yearly show keeps public education at the forefront of Senate priorities.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moose, who has attended two or three rallies, notes that the relationship between the Montgomery County Education Association (MCEA), the union advancing the interests of 14,000 MCPS teachers, and MCPS has been generally neutral. "The protest rallies are all very peaceful and well intentioned," he says. "We try to provide the best services we can, but sometimes that means going to Annapolis and carrying signs."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to Moose, salaries are one of the main issues that teachers are fighting for. It takes a teacher twenty years to earn the median household income in Montgomery County, with salaries starting at $52,000 per year and capping at $104,000. "No teacher does this job to get wealthy," Moose says. "I'm wearing my Blair t-shirt and my Costco pants and my car's 16 years old— and I love my job— but you need to make enough to purchase a home and raise a family."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moose is thankful for the guaranteed pension that teachers receive, but he notes that the county is providing successively skimpier plans for new teachers. Currently, three tiers of pension plans exist, with teachers who begin working after 2011 working longer for a smaller slice of the pie. "If you look at the contract, they make the pension plan less attractive every 10 or 15 years," Moose says. "You don't get quite as much, but in today's economy, some people don't have </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">anything</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> guaranteed."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Social studies teacher Anne Manuel mentions that the insufficient salaries and scant pension plans disincentivize potential educators from taking on the job. "Teachers do not make anything comparable to other professions with the same education requirements," she says. "I used to be a human rights activist, and it took me about 17 years of teaching to catch up to what I was earning before."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">More than anything, music teacher Isabel Hernandez-Cata wants to see more clarity in the new contracts. Not only are the wordings of procedures extremely vague, the current contract is filled with irrelevant statements that are disregarded in practice. "It's ambiguous to the point where people can twist it to the detriment of teachers," she says. "I really think every word needs to be updated. The contract looks good, but it's not being upheld."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hernandez-Cata has experienced the adverse effects of an unclear contract firsthand. Despite proving that her Master's degree was a three-year program, the county halted her benefits under academic leave after two years, instead requiring her to pay $68,000 if she didn't return to the job in time. "My benefits were unclear and they were pulled out from under me midway through my master's program," Hernandez-Cata says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the pay rate, Moose loves teaching and wouldn't trade his job for anything else. "I asked my philosophy class to raise their hand if they know anybody—mom, dad, or Uncle Joe—who doesn't like their job and a lot of hands go up," he says. When choosing a career, teachers have always chosen the joy of raising the next generation of innovators over a raise in pay.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Therefore, Moose finds the arguments against funding for teachers and schools rather amusing, as opponents are essentially preventing better educations for their children. "I think the most important people in a kid's life after guardians are the teachers— they spend hundreds of thousands of hours with them from kindergarten through 12th grade," he says. "Don't you want that person to be well qualified, well compensated, and committed to their job?"</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition to bolstering salaries, teachers advocate for funding for better programs and resources for students. MCPS hires psychologists to work with students, but they're shared between schools. Thus, these psychologists have no time to meet and get to know students, much less understand their personal issues. "It's not just about the paychecks we get, it's also about the environment that we work in," Moose says. "How can you slice and dice a psychologist? It takes time to sit with kids and talk things out." Especially at Blair, a fraction of a psychologist serving roughly 3,400 kids is far from enough.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teachers show their support for passing the Kirwan Commission, which poses solutions for many of their complaints, by wearing red on certain days as a part of the broader national public education campaign </span><a href="http://neatoday.org/redfored/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">#RedForEd</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. "I think it'll put us on the right track," Hernandez-Cata says. "We paid all that money for that study, and now I think we should try to follow through with it."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair teachers participate in activism because of the need they see for elevated school environments and resources that benefit both themselves and the students they teach. "Early childhood care, teacher pay and serving underprivileged communities—those reasons provided by the Kirwan Commission were enough to get me to put on a red shirt," Manuel says. </span></p>	32317

Despite the uncomfortable temperature, spirits were high among the well-seasoned team as they dominated the majority of events held at the meet.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Kicking off with diving, both teams clashed in and out of the water. With each dive, the respective team seemed to cheer louder and louder until the conclusion of the event, leaving the Blazer boys ahead by seven points and the girls ahead by five points.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32502"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair moved on to capitalize in the freestyle relay, claiming all top positions for the boys, while securing first and third place for the girls in the respective heats. The two Blair halves continued to dominate in the 100-yard butterfly with both boys and girls placing at the top of the leaderboard.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To the surprise of many onlookers, junior Joshua Frost zipped past his teammates and the Northwest competition from lane seven in the boy’s 50-yard freestyle heat, claiming first place. “Right when I dove in I tried to go as fast as I could. After taking my first breath, I felt another burst of energy.” He said. “When you’re in an end lane you’re always trying to prove you’re better. You have something to work for.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The 500-yard freestyle tested the stamina of both teams, but the Blazers pushed through once again, placing 1st and 3rd across the boys.

The boys led their heat finishing 1st and 2nd, but Northwest put up a stronger fight against the girls.

33149	The growing need for improved communication regarding sexual misconduct protocols in MCPS	<p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><em>TRIGGER WARNING: This article contains non-graphic descriptions of and information about sexual abuse and trauma. Where only first names appear, names have been changed to protect the identities of the sources.</em></strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This past summer, hundreds of Montgomery County students took to social media to share and discuss allegations of sexual assault and harassment. This movement illuminated existing gaps in communication, flaws within county and school protocols, and most importantly, the lack of clarity regarding student safety plans. Protecting MCPS students from assault and abuse is immensely complex, but increased transparency in how the county communicates and connects with the student body is a necessity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though MCPS has standardized protocols for processing allegations, school and county agencies must improve student outreach programs to close critical gaps in communications to best help students and administrators understand and follow these protocols. Ensuring better accessibility to victim resources through the use of social media and web content is imperative.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One writer on the SurvivoratBlair Instagram account, where Blair students anonymously discuss their experiences with sexual misconduct, explained that they were left to process their assault, which happened on school grounds, without support from the school. Other than sharing on social media, they “never talked about [their experience] with anyone before.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another anonymous writer on the account noted their perspective as a teacher in MCPS. “The problem is that in MCPS there are no consequences for anything,” they wrote. Accounts throughout the SurvivorAtBlair account echo a clear lack of transparency from the county: Far too many victims of sexual assault and harassment feel unsupported and unable to come forward with their stories.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33148"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The MCPS process for filing an allegation of sexual assault or harassment is designed to comply with federal Title IX standards, which apply to all federally-funded institutions—like our school system. Currently, the county Board of Education is faced with the formidable task of adapting their Title IX policy to match federal changes made in May; the new rules include requiring a higher standard of evidence from victims. Patricia O’Neill, who chairs the BOE’s Policy Management Committee, says that everyone on the Board takes this task “incredibly seriously.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the best of intentions, the existing ambiguity surrounding the MCPS process for addressing cases of sexual assault or harassment will only be exacerbated by these changes to the county Title IX policy. Continuing to support student victims while also complying with the changed federal policy will become increasingly challenging, which makes it more imperative that the county communicates clearly with the student body to ensure that the MCPS population at large is able to navigate these changes and their implications.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While there is much work to be done in improving and maximizing the MCPS procedures for processing sexual assault, transparency is key to ensure that the student body is fully aware of their options and can access the resources that </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">do</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> exist. Accounts from students, like those presented on the SurvivorAtBlair Instagram account, illustrate opportunities to improve the transparency and efficacy of options for victim support—because every student with a sexual assault story should have been made aware of every option in going forward with their case.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Currently, students seeking information about MCPS protocols and support are encouraged to attend the sessions held by the Student Welfare and Compliance program and the MCPS Board of Education. Despite these measures, many members of the MCPS student body remain uninformed about the MCPS sexual assault and harassment procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The sheer scale of the MCPS system makes visibility and consistent messaging an elusive goal, according to Montgomery County Title IX Coordinator Greg Edmundson. “When you have 208 schools and 165,000 students, the ability to be as consistent in practice as possible is really difficult,” Edmundson said. When countywide student outreach programs lack standardization,&nbsp;it is increasingly difficult to make them accessible to such a large and varied student body.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Specifically at Blair, resource counselor Makeyda Soriano explained that the counseling department is doing its best to use social media to connect with the student body. “[We try to] stay as visible as we can; we do our best to respond to messages on our social media if students want to message us directly,'' Soriano said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Intentions are good and efforts are being made, yet many students are still underserved as critical information remains under the radar. The Blair Counseling Department’s Instagram account, for example, is only followed by 313 users. Even if we assume that every follower is a Blair student, this accounts for less than 10 percent of all roughly 3,200 Blazers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Students who have not had encounters with sexual assault or harassment usually aren’t actively seeking out resources regarding the reporting process. Then, when they need the information, it’s too late. The truth is, nobody expects that something like sexual harassment, assault, or abuse to happen to them—until it does. But the social media movement over the summer demonstrated that sexual misconduct is exceedingly common, and survivors often don’t know what resources are available or where to seek support.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Refining student outreach programs to include more accessible web content and better use of social media channels will ensure that all students have access to the information necessary to navigate the process of coming forward with an allegation, even if they don’t need it yet. Maximizing the use of social media to create a clearer understanding of the process of reporting sexual assault could help close a critical communication gap.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Given the existing disparities in service to students and the looming federal policy changes, MCPS—both school-level administrators and central policymakers—must take this opportunity to increase transparency. They must evolve in a way that serves students facing trauma from assault, abuse, or harassment in order to make our schools safer for all.</span></p>	33148
31965	The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra's recent financial struggles seem to reflect a decline in classical music interest.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When people hear the words “classical music,” they may immediately think of boring three-hour&nbsp;concerts that only the elderly attend. In the era of Internet-viral music icons and catchy pop tunes, Paganini and Tchaikovsky— two of the most celebrated classical composers— seem to pale in comparison to modern music. Unfortunately, this lack of appreciation and attention towards classical music is taking a toll on the music industry.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Most recently, the decline of classical music listeners caused the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra (BSO) to cancel its summer shows, cutting the schedule down from 50 weeks to 42 weeks. The BSO had been a 52 week, year-round orchestra for the past 35 years; the new 42 week contract has caused an uproar, creating a tension between musicians and the management.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sadly, this change is necessary as the orchestra has lost more than $16 million in the past decade, according to the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2019/05/31/728640388/baltimore-symphony-orchestra-suddenly-cancels-summer-season" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Baltimore Sun</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. The schedule change also puts BSO’s title as a world class orchestra at stake. In an effort to reduce losses and increase profits, the BSO has drastically cut down musicians’ pay. In an interview conducted by the </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2019/05/31/728640388/baltimore-symphony-orchestra-suddenly-cancels-summer-season" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Baltimore Sun</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Brian Prechtl, percussionist and co-chairman of the BSO players, said that this change will cause many great players to leave the BSO for better paying orchestras.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31964"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Much of the public is saddened by the summer schedule concert cancellations. Anticipated events, like a live performance of “Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince” score or a concert alongside Leslie Odom Jr. are all cancelled.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even in the midst of this difficult time for the BSO, I find the resilience of the musicians inspiring. One of the most awaited cancelled events of the summer concert series was the 4th of July performance at Oregon Ridge Park. However, fueled by their dedication to give back to the community, the BSO players decided to continue with the Independence day show. Backed by the Baltimore County Executive, Johnny </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">Olszewski Jr.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, the players were able to put on this concert independently, even during the summer lockout.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nevertheless, as the last notes of the “1812 Overture” by Tchaikovsky rang out, the uncertain future of the BSO still undoubtedly weighed heavily on the listener's mind. In fact, even with the community support, it is an unwelcome fact that even the most prestigious orchestras are losing money. Today, some of the world’s most famous symphony orchestras, like the </span><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/howard-reich/ct-ent-chicago-symphony-orchestra-strike-cso-0312-story.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Chicago Symphony Orchestra</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, are having conflicts over money and musician pay/pension.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Running any type of symphony orchestra is very expensive, not to mention at a world class level. The pay needs to be good enough to attract top players; this makes the labor costs of roughly a 100 musicians (from </span><a href="https://www.bso.org/brands/bso/about-us/musicians/bso-musicians/full-bso-roster.aspx" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">BSO roster</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">), conductors, librarians, managers and directors quite expensive. Adding to that are venue, community event and guest performances/soloist costs.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Additionally, the audience for classical music seems to not only be thinning but graying as well. There is a general notable lack of enthusiasm from teenagers and millennials towards this type of music. Substituted instead by mumble rap (a microgenre of hip hop) or repetitive pop music, this absence of interest can translate to a lack of attendance at classical music concerts in the future.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Classical music is not as popular as it once was. As more people push this genre off their playlists, the fate of classical music seems uncertain. Going forward, the future of all these dedicated, hardworking and talented artists; the future of such moving, joyous and amazing compositions also live precariously on the edge.</span></p>	31964
32925	How musical artists are connecting with fans and helping others during the lockdown	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the coronavirus lockdown continues with no clear end in sight, musicians and other artists have been putting out content in hopes of connecting with their fans, and, in some cases, helping those who need it. Although traditional concerts aren’t currently possible, musicians and singers have found a variety of opportunities to keep releasing music and engaging with people.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During this quarantine, releasing new music, especially collabs, has been challenging without the ability to meet in person. Despite these challenges, pop artists Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber released the song “Stuck with U" together on May 8.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32924"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The music video features clips sent in from quarantined fans and celebrities showing who they are “stuck with,” which helps to minimize the potential awkwardness of the two artists never being together in person during the video. As a result, it reads as a genuine, if slightly heavy-handed, attempt to connect with people who feel isolated and alone.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Along with releasing new works, musicians have been recording their own mini-concerts on Youtube and Instagram. Hayley Kiyoko held a mini-concert on June 28 as part of an ongoing Pride celebration. In this video, Kiyoko and her backup artists recorded their parts separately and had the final product edited together. This “concert” was well received, with around 88 thousand views, and presented a way for Kiyoko to give back to her fans.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many artists are feeling the need to reach out to their fans through livestreams on Youtube or Instagram. These livestreams are ways to connect with fans and&nbsp;to gain support. Additionally, it adds a layer of realism to these artists, as they are giving the fans a chance to understand that they are going through some of the same problems. They also serve as a means to show support to issues that their audiences care about,&nbsp;especially the COVID-19 epidemic and Black Lives Matter protests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">An interesting thing to consider is the apparent irony of artists trying to empathize with ordinary people, despite the obvious fact that rich artists are in a far better position than many people who might have lost their jobs or be at a health risk. One way that many artists have reconciled this fact is through charity work like running fundraisers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Due to the recent events, including Black Lives Matter protests, COVID-19 cases rising, and many more, it is common to see a livestream or video run by a famous singer to raise money for one of the many charities that help COVID-19 sufferers, or to Black Lives Matter Foundations. In fact, “Stuck with U” was a fundraiser, with a link on the video leading to the First Responders Children's Foundation, a charity that supports first responders.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The only issue with those fundraisers is that it asks people to give their money, as opposed to the celebrities who can&nbsp;afford it. However, many musicians have been donating to various charities over the past few months. For example, The Weeknd donated $1,000,000 to COVID-19 relief efforts, and Future and Madonna have donated masks. All these efforts help many people, and are ways for the artists to show that they care about current events and are using their fame for good.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The COVID-19 outbreak has meant that musicians cannot traditionally connect with or help people, but many have been finding a way. Whether through collaborations, online concerts, or donations to charities, most artists have been finding a way to use their fame and talent in a productive way during these uncertain times.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32924
31559	The roles and responsibilities of Silver Chips Online's first-ever ombudsman	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hello, Blazers! My name is Mahnaz Habib. I am a senior CAP student, and as Silver Chips Online's first ever ombudsman, I represent the values of the publication and address concerns from the public. It is crucial for any publication to speak about prevalent journalistic issues and to converse regularly over the aspects of writing an effective piece. Silver Chips Online is an independent student-run newspaper with particular values that always must be upheld. Our motto, </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">nullae morae - nullae rationales</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, emphasizes our dedication to informing our readers in a timely manner.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31558"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So why bring an ombudsman to Silver Chips Online this year? This role has become a vital part of being an effective and efficient publication. Today's heated political climate and the recent rise in Blair student activism have made it essential that we represent everyone's viewpoints on current events. Blair is a very condensed liberal bubble, and minority viewpoints are often not heard or given any attention. This new role will ensure that we are connecting with these students and any other students who shy away from sharing their opinions in fear of being attacked.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a publication, we allow our journalists to express their opinions on events affecting the Blair community. However, whether on our staff or not, all of you have the right to express your questions or concerns. This is why I am here. I can address comments on stories and ensure that everyone's voice is being heard. From lifestyle blogs, to news blurbs to editorial pieces, I will bring issues to the attention of the whole staff and then respond to them in my pieces.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Whether it is the newest MCPS policies or the political climate at Blair, there is always a hot button issue that is directly impacting the Blair community. As ombudsman, I take on the responsibility of speaking for what goes behind-the-scenes at our publication and responding to our readers to uphold the values of high-quality journalism. Ultimately, my goal is to speak to the thousands of students who share different perspectives at our school.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I want to make sure that all of your diverse suggestions are heard because we value the importance in conserving all unique ideas. As a publication, we do our best to represent everyone's voice by collaborating with a variety of students, but there is always an opportunity for outside voices to give us their take on current events if they believe their opinion does not align with that of our writers. With that in mind, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to comment in our comments section, tag us @mbhsSCO on Twitter, or email me at </span><a href="mailto:ombudsman.sco@gmail.com" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">ombudsman.sco@gmail.com</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

31931	Blair students are looking ahead to the 2020 presidential election	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">March for Our Lives shirts, "Beto 2020" pins, stickers with the words "I stand with Planned Parenthood" —&nbsp;these are just some of the political symbols that Blair students have been displaying in recent months. Political conversations in the school community are constant on Instagram stories and at lunch tables alike. As the country enters an election season in the midst of a tense political climate, Blazers are very much active in the political scene. While only some Blair students are eligible to vote, most have strong opinions on who they would like to see in office and which policy issues they consider most important.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31930"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With over 20 Democrats and multiple Republicans running, the ballot for 2020 already looks diverse. Some Blazers aren't sure which candidate they will be supporting yet, but many have begun to narrow down their selection. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Htoo Eh Redford-Maung Maung is scrutinizing candidates and looking at their funding histories to help him decide who he will be supporting. "Concerning Beto O'Rourke — a lot of people think he's a cool guy, he gains the </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=E01++" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">second most</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> money from [oil and gas] industries," he says. "We have to have people in office who actually care about our earth... so I feel like we have to be aware of who gets what from different lobbyists, corporations and companies." </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Ezra Schwartz is also invested in making his decisions based on candidates' pasts, citing corporate money and previous legislation as a deciding factor. "If you look at any of their records, Joe Biden was the author of the crime bill, Kamala Harris as a prosecutor jailed parents of truant kids and Cory Booker has been very close with Wall Street and Big Pharma," Schwartz explains. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Schwartz's friend Noah Gleason, also a senior, echoes the same sentiment. "Most of the candidates are way too centrist and corporate and taking large amounts of Wall Street money, so I don't really trust them," he says. Gleason isn't alone in shying away from centrist candidates — the past months have brought a slew of </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/the-run/articles/2019-02-08/under-siege-centrist-democrats-still-see-a-pathway-for-victory-in-2020" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">opposition</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to centrist Democrats. Celebrities and politicians alike have issued calls across social media for voters to oppose centrism in the 2020 primaries. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Because of their preference for more progressive candidates, Schwartz and Gleason have both decided to support Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ran as an independent in the general election. Sanders is the "furthest left viable candidate," according to Gleason. Both students made their choice partly because they appreciate his consistent voting record. </span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38); background-color: transparent;">"Since he was in his 20s he was getting arrested in civil rights protests. Bernie's the only one with a real record of consistently pushing for progressive policies and not just going on with trends," Schwartz says. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Non-career-politicians are included in Blazers' preferences too. Junior Aaron Shoham, who will be voting for the first time in 2020, is thinking about supporting Andrew Yang. Yang, an entrepreneur who announced his candidacy quite early, has gained popularity because of his support of universal basic income and his policies to prevent technology from taking over jobs. "I don't know exactly whether [Yang] has a chance of winning, but I think his ideas are really interesting… I think he's going to bring those issues into the public consciousness, which I think is important," Shoham explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even Blazers who haven't picked a specific candidate yet are fixated on certain policy issues they hope will be at the forefront of the conversation leading into 2020. Climate change is a top contender. "I feel like my personal priority is what candidates' global warming policies are. Climate change is an issue that, in order for human beings and nature to thrive, has to [be addressed]," Redford-Maung Maung says. Gleason, citing the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">100</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> companies responsible for 70% of carbon emissions, shares similar concerns. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Other Blair students, continuing their involvement in ongoing movements, hope to see gun control, immigration policy and reproductive rights discussed in this election cycle. "I care the most about gun control and immigration policy," junior Auzinea Bacon says. "I do have family members that are immigrants so I think that puts me closer to the issue personally… but it's important for everyone." </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There will undoubtedly be an even larger politically-minded population at Blair as 2020 draws closer, especially within student activism organizations like Young Republicans and Young Democrats. Even those who aren't politically involved are being encouraged to participate by their peers. "Google candidates and their pasts, don't just read headlines," Schwartz laughs, advising those who are getting involved. With many controversial issues and candidates on the table, it is sure to be an interesting election season at Blair. </span></p>	31930

Instead of separate connectivity methods, the three smart home devices will now connect over Internet Protocol (IP), the backbone of the modern internet. Thus, any “smart” device can be used and operated by any in-home system. </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/18/apple-google-amazon-zigbee-partner-on-smart-home.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">In a press release</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, the companies said that “by building upon IP, the project aims to enable communication across smart home devices, mobile apps and cloud services and to define a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The partnership will focus on first setting a standard connectivity for physical safety smart home devices, such as smoke alarms and carbon monoxide sensors, smart doors and locks, security systems, electrical plugs and window shades before expanding into other types of devices and commercial solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the “Project Connected Home over IP” gadgets come out, there will be a logo on the box to notify consumers that it can be used across platforms. The first standard IP smart home devices are set to roll out late this year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A collaboration between the three biggest tech giants in the world is not the only update in store for 2020.

32733	Teachers take up side jobs ranging from starting businesses to waiting tables	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“You’ll be surprised to know how many teachers have other jobs, mostly out of necessity. It is very expensive to live here and we have to supplement our income,” CAP Coordinator Sarah Fillman says. From managing a farm to becoming a published photographer, teachers often take up ‘side hustles' to subsidize their income or explore a wide range of passions not found in teaching.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Below are just some of the stories of how teachers spend their time outside the classroom:&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">FillmanFoto</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Around 2013, CAP Coordinator Sarah Fillman was shooting a picture in front of a beautiful sunrise in New Zealand. A Korean man approached Fillman and asked how to take a picture like hers. Three days later, she ran into the man again in Australia. He was ecstatic and wanted to take a picture with her. “Only photography could break such barriers. The beauty of photography is timing moments just right so that the photos can conjure up feelings of fun, love, and happiness,” Fillman says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32732"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Stories like the one above are what motivated Fillman to start her photography business, “FillmanFoto.” “I always loved photography, and when one of my best friends got married, I followed her photographer around for the night. I shadowed her for several events, took some photography business classes, and eventually created a business,” Fillman continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With two businesses and a full-time teaching job, Fillman admits that she can go 3-4 weeks without a day off. “I started contracting off my editing, because during the busy spring/fall seasons, it can get overwhelming. I try to keep my teaching job and my photography business separate. When the busy season starts, I’m usually shooting every weekend, each event is six hours, and I’m carrying about 20 pounds worth of equipment,” Filman says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Because of her hard work, Fillman was recently </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/november-december-2019/a-smash-hit/2/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">published </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">in the Bethesda Magazine for a photo of the wedding of one of CAVA’s co-founders. Although the photography business started just as a side gig, Fillman loves being able to apply a creative side in her everyday life. She takes pride in being the photographer for most CAP-related events and being called on to capture beautiful memories for others.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Find some of Sarah Fillman’s work on her website, </em><a href="http://fillmanfoto.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>FillmanFoto</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</em></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Takoma Sports Camp</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Last summer, we couldn't do our summer sports camp in Takoma Park, and we had to move it somewhere else because all the gyms were full. And the parents were like there's no way my kids are missing camp. We're going to rent a bus and get a driver to take them out there,” Physical Education teacher Louis Hoelman recalls, “That overwhelming sense of community that came together for my sports camp was amazing.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hoelman primarily focuses on fostering inclusion and community through his summer sports camp, “Takoma Sports Camp,” that has been running since 1997. “I used to teach elementary school PE, and all the parents wanted me to start a summer camp. I started off with baseball, but as time went on, my camp started becoming so popular that I added two weeks of baseball, three weeks of basketball, and one week of fast-pitch softball,” Hoelman says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hoelman comments that the most rewarding part of running a summer camp is seeing the smiles of kids’ faces. “[The kids] tell their parents that it’s their favorite camp. Since I’ve been running this for so long, I see individual kids’ growth throughout the years. They start when they are six or seven and come back to work for the camp when they’re about 17 or 18,” Hoelman continues.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Learn more about Takoma Sports Camp </em><a href="http://www.takomasportscamps.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>here</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Farm at Our House</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“We live and die by the sweat of our brow. There is no safety net,” says Social Studies teacher Marc Grossman.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Grossman owns and manages a 12-acre farm in Brooksville, MD named “The Farm at Our House,” and he strongly believes that farming teaches students virtuous habits and values. Grossman’s farm caters to well-known restaurants like Addie’s, Dino’s Grotto and Blacks Market Bistro. He also runs a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) where community members can go pick up food.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Like many, Grossman took a plunge into the deep end when he first started his farm. “In 2007, I was doing a summer program for MCPS. After they cut it, I did something crazy. I rented out six community garden plots in Rockville and somehow got myself to the farmer’s market in the morning. From there, I started a farm,” Grossman says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32731"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For Grossman, the farming business wasn’t just to subsidize his income. “It’s been a hard road to tow. I could have just gotten a minimum wage job to gain more money back then. But, I was thinking in the long term and the benefits [it] could provide later,” Grossman continues.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A part of his farm’s philosophy is to introduce the next generation of high school students to sustainable living and agriculture. “Schools only teach an elementary introduction to the ideas of farming. I really want to expose kids to the next generation of sustainability, and we do that through summer internships,” Grossman says, “We teach students planting, weeding, harvesting and possibly marketing and sales.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Grossman’s passion for farming comes from his interest in the developing world around him. “Farming creates this social fabric that bonds people together in a community and also provides revenues critical for making government. I don’t think many people think about it or appreciate it enough,” Grossman concludes.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.thefarmatourhouse.com/about.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>Learn more</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> about “The Farm at Our House.”</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32731

Search "tech" on Google and you will find mentions of privacy concerns in new products and rumors of "digital watchdogs." Here and there, we see government and industry coming together to discuss the ethics of artificial intelligence, the ethics of self-driving cars, the list goes on.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair cybersecurity teacher Vickie Wright emphasizes how ethics education is becoming increasingly important as new technology develops. "Keep in mind, computer science and cybersecurity, these are fields that are new and quickly evolving, so topics like ethics are becoming an essential part of your education," Wright says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A detailed </span><a href="https://medium.com/@cfiesler/tech-ethics-curricula-a-collection-of-syllabi-3eedfb76be18" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">inventory</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of tech ethics courses across multiple universities shows that tech ethics is an interdisciplinary venture, one that benefits not just the future tech geek but everyone.

On the techie's side, it is about power and trust. Technologists have the power to do harm, but practice restraint because they are aware of the moral responsibility that comes with such power. On the consumer side, it is about awareness. To be a smart consumer, it is important to keep in mind the ethical questions tech giants consider before building a product. Being a smart consumer means knowing the potential dangers that come with using such a product.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is responsible teaching. Let the Naviance data breach be a lesson to MCPS. Let this year's data breach be the last violation of the ethical limits of technology committed in MCPS by MCPS students.</span></p>	32450
33614	Unlike Princess Diana, this musical is forgettable and contributes nothing to the world	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Diana: The Musical" manages to be drier than a history textbook, and viewers will have more fun reading Princess Diana's Wikipedia page. Released on Netflix on Oct. 1, the&nbsp;musical starts off with enough potential, simply due to what the musical is about. However, "Diana: The Musical" simply does not get better and can only be described using one word: unmemorable.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The musical summarizes the life of Princess Diana (Jeanna de Waal), starting from her marriage to Prince Charles (Roe Hartrampf) until her death. Despite Diana's incredible amount of charity work, the musical chooses to spend most of its time focusing on her marriage with Charles. The musical begins with one of Diana's first meetings with Charles, then moves on to their marriage, the birth of their sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, and finally, to their many marital problems, most of which stem from Charles' affair with Duchess Camilla (Erin Davie).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In real life, Diana had worked with numerous charities and organizations. She was the spokesperson for and patron of the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation, and helped raise over $1 million for cancer research in a campaign. She also visited patients diagnosed with AIDS and patients diagnosed with leprosy to help dispel stigma around the diseases. She advocated against landmines and used her fame to bring much-needed attention to the issues caused by landmines. However, there are only a few scenes that have to do with Diana's charity work, all of them brief and none of them receiving the attention they deserve. The one exception is the scene in which Diana visits patients suffering from AIDS. But even then, the scene only shows the bare minimum: Diana enters the hospital, shakes hands with the patients, chats very briefly, and then leaves. More screen time is spent showing Diana's affair with James Hewitt (Gareth Keegan) than Diana's work with charity organizations.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the amount of time the movie spends on Diana's marriage with Charles, their relationship lacks any semblance of nuance and is as bland as a stale crumpet. For the first half of the musical, their relationship is a cycle of Diana seeking approval, and sometimes love, from Charles while he continues his affair with Camilla. Charles and Camilla have an equally-dull relationship; their conversations never move beyond their professions of love for one another.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first song, "Underestimated," is exactly what one would expect: Diana singing about how she has been underestimated. Although the lyrics aren't particularly horrible, there are still lines that don't fit. The lines "You never once stood out/Hardly passed a test," fit in with the song as much as Diana fits in with the rest of the royal family. The rest of the lyrics are more general statements about how the British royal family underestimates and treats Diana, such as "They minimize your thoughts/They maximize your flaws," so suddenly bringing in information about Diana's academic success is random and unnecessary. Additionally, the melody is flat and repetitive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the last song of the musical, "If (Light The World)," Diana reflects on her divorce with Charles and her future plans. Despite the monotonous melody that better resembles a lecture than a song, the song is not completely horrible until the unnecessary and unexpected lines,"</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(250, 251, 252);">If Charles steps aside/And let my William reign/Then all this suffering/Will not have been in vain." Prince William has never appeared in this musical, other than during his birth, so it makes no sense to imply that "all this suffering" was all for the possibility of William becoming king.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: rgb(250, 251, 252); color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although each of the actors sang their part well, the songs themselves are boring and unmemorable, and none of the melodies are catchy nor the lyrics meaningful.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To be fair, not all of the songs are completely terrible. One of the first songs, "This Is How Your People Dance," does a decent job at showing how detached Charles is from Diana and the general public. "Whatever Love Means Anyway" has a slightly catchier melody and a clever reference to one of Charles' real-life quotes (when asked if he was in love with Diana, he had apparently replied with "Whatever 'in love' means").&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another thing that the musical does well is the scene in which Diana dies. The scene transitions suddenly from showing Diana’s hopes for her future to her death, reflecting the abruptness of Diana's real-life death.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Beyond these glimmers of mediocrity, this musical adds nothing new. The musical makes no new insights and presents no new information about Diana's life. "Diana: The Musical" only repeats what has already been said, many times and in much better ways.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Diana: The Musical" is rated PG-13 for strong language and for suggestive and thematic material and is now available on Netflix</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.&nbsp;</span></p>	33613
33299	This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33298"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Why was the Diversity and Inclusion Instructional Coordinator position created specifically this year?</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThis role was created based on the vision of Principal Renay Johnson. It was instituted over the summer when the entire country was engaged in this collective reflection and reckoning for us to face the extent of racial injustice and bias in our nation's institutions. These issues aren’t new. What’s new is the nation's willingness to engage around it with any level of consensus. Blair is no different. We've always upheld as a tenet of our community that we value our diversity and try to ensure that we’re celebrating and respecting those different cultures, backgrounds, genders, and so on. This position was created to engage in a deeper commitment and create a more intense focus on some of the priorities we've had for a long time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What responsibilities does your new role entail?</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tI engage in a couple of different major areas. I work in tandem with the administrative team to help provide strategic leadership and planning around some of these issues. As a school, we have the big, lofty goal of increasing equity, but how do we start to strategize and come up with incremental milestones and targets that will help us arrive at that goal?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAnother big focus is training and professional development for my colleagues. A lot of teachers and staff want to engage in this work. They want to have these conversations, be a trusted and safe adult, and have relational trust around these issues with their students. But they just feel unprepared. I am behind a lot of the work that provides support for teachers. I helped develop the recent lesson in innovation periods around race and equity, specifically microaggressions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAnother thing I do is data assessment. How do we measure how we’re doing? It's one thing to have a goal, but we have to know how well we're progressing toward that goal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe last thing is I engage with community organizations and partners. I'm working with the Student Government Association (SGA) right now on a project that will allow students to collaborate directly with teachers to develop lessons that are more culturally responsive and help have conversations around race as it relates to each particular content area because it does impact every content area. The question is how students can have a leading voice in this. What do students want to talk about? All of that falls under the purview of this role.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What are some specific steps you are taking to make Blair more equitable?</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWe can't talk about equity without looking at our application programs. We have to look at who’s participating in these programs––AP participation is similar in this regard. What is the culture in these rooms? How can we expand access so there are fewer disparities in participation? How can we improve the culture in these classrooms for students of color and ensure the climate is welcoming for all students?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOur publications are something else that I’ve been looking at. When we look at the leadership and staffing in publications, do they fully represent the community? That’s at the heart of all of these questions. Does the participation in our classrooms, extracurriculars, and everything else within Blair mirror the full demographic makeup of our school? If not, we have to be thinking about what we can do to change that.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tI am a Blair Magnet alumnus myself. I know what it’s like to sit in those classrooms and not see many people who look like me. In the wake of this reckoning, folks are looking squarely at magnet programs and questioning their role in recreating inequities in society. Thomas Jefferson High School in Fairfax County in Virginia just abolished their program’s admission test because as a community they decided they wanted to expand access and equity. I expect MCPS and Blair will look at similar types of interventions. I’d love to see us respond in a similar way.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What do you want students to know?</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When students have concerns, I’m an additional person they can reach out to. Student voices have to be what drives this process. For everyone who feels like these conversations are overdue or there’s a better way that we could be doing this, reach out and speak up in class. We have to create a culture where it’s the norm to talk about these issues. It shouldn’t feel like we’re somehow impolite or not on task because we want to talk about these issues. It's not going to get better if we can't confront these systemic issues around race, gender, misogyny, patriarchy, transphobia, homophobia, and more. This is our job as a community and I hope everyone feels comfortable seizing this moment to make sure we keep this on the forefront. </span></p>	33298
32076	Back-up players fulfill an often overlooked, but crucial role for their team	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The crowd erupts in raucous cheers as the Blazers score yet another touchdown, watching the players race down the sidelines as they relish in the win. The players on the sidelines, however, are overlooked by the average spectator. About a quarter of the players on the football team spend more time on the sidelines than on the field, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">but they truly have one of the most important roles on the team. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32075"></div><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jonathan Hoang</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The players on the field tend to be the ones basking in glory and fame after a win, but the players on the sideline are overlooked. They're always around to help their teammates with keeping them cool, and help them with moral support as a whole."When my teammates get mad because of something they could've done that they didn't do, I'm there to support them, trying to keep their heads up while also trying to keep them calm," senior wide receiver and linebacker Jonathan Hoang says. It's crucial for players like Hoang to keep the team morale high, "I always try to have a positive energy for the team and try not to have my teammates go off on each other," he states. As one of the seniors on the team, he has a leadership role despite being a special teams player, "I feel like some of the younger guys do look up to me," Hoang says.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew Merrill</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though he is one of the only sophomores on varsity, quarterback and wide receiver Andrew Merrill has become very influential to his teammates. "I learned that the more vocal that you become, the more people are going to listen. I've become more vocal on and off the field and started to connect with more players than last year," Merrill claims. Merrill aims to use his skill to make his teammates more competitive and challenge themselves. "I’m the guy in practice that likes to challenge my teammates to go hard so they can get better. I’m not the best athlete in the world, but pushing each other in practice helps this team a lot," he says. Since he is younger and less experienced than his teammates, Merrill's bound to get less time. "I didn't expect to play much because of the skill there is at my position. The guys ahead of me are more experienced than I am so it's difficult to try to beat them for a starting spot," he states.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chidi Opara</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Some players, such as junior offensive/defensive lineman Chidi Opara, embrace their role on the sidelines and see it as an opportunity to learn from star players. "I love being out there on the field. I want to get better everyday, and people like Zaire Cooper, Khalif Welch and Chris Watkins have great support for me. Cooper helps me with my technique as a lineman," Opara says. As Cooper has been very successful for the Blazers, Opara aspires to fill his shoes and have the same impact on the team.&nbsp;Although it can be frustrating, Opara also takes advantage of his time on the sidelines by trying to gain knowledge on the sport, becoming a student of the game.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Christopher Johnson</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Christopher Johnson is part of a very talented group of running backs on the Blair football team, joining senior Christopher Watkins and junior Brian Williams. He takes this opportunity to learn from his fellow running backs. "It’s basically like taking a class, you are always learning what to do by watching them practice and play," Johnson chuckles. Another key role of players like Johnson is their position on the scout team. The scout team imitates the upcoming opponent, giving the team a simulation of plays they'll run and what to expect. "My role on the team is basically being an MVP on the scout teams and helping the players get better during practice," he says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From moral support to preparing their teammates for their next opponent, these players do it all. Although they might spend most of their time on the sidelines, they have an immensely important role to play in the team.</span></p>	32075
32129	MCPS' new policy on substitute teacher requirements will benefit all parties involved.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) recently changed its substitute requirements so that anyone with at least 60 college credits or an associate degree can apply to be a substitute. Previously, applicants needed to have at least a bachelor's degree. The change was made in response to increases in substitute vacancies and enrollment. Although it may seem like MCPS' decision is lowering standards, it's actually beneficial to students, staff and potential applicants.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">More substitute applicants leads to a wider pool to choose from when teachers can't come to work. This means that there are fewer vacancies, so students are still under adult supervision. Ensuring that students are learning and getting work done prevents teachers from worrying about them falling behind. It eliminates the need for teachers who are supposed to be having a planning period to provide in-class coverage as well.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Critics may may also be concerned that less educated substitutes aren't knowledgeable enough about all subjects to be teaching them, however, the majority of teachers assign "busy work" consisting of textbook assignments and review guides that don't require the substitutes to do anything other than to supervise the students anyway.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair substitute Weston Martin remarks that because substitutes don't always teach the same subject when they fill in, being an expert in a specific field is not necessary. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Generally, the subs are not required to only substitute in specific areas," he said. "I have training in science, so I'm more comfortable in a science classroom. But I could easily go into a history classroom, or a foreign language classroom… and maintain discipline and have [the students] be on task," he added.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, non-certified teachers are only paid $18.41 per hour, whereas certified teachers make $19.58 per hour, which may encourage more substitutes to become certified.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Furthermore, MCPS is bringing its standards to the same level as neighboring counties such as Frederick, Howard, Prince George's and Fairfax, all of which have 60 college credits as their minimum requirement to apply to be a substitute teacher. Martin points out that this ensures the county is able to compete with other districts in recruiting subs since it increases the potential substitute pool. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I think requiring a bachelor's degree actually shrinks the pool," he said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The quality of substitutes in the county is already higher than what most think. Martin explains that many immigrants who were teachers in their native countries are not allowed to be teachers in Montgomery County because they don't have all of the necessary degrees and certifications, so they sub instead while they work towards getting their degree. "T</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">here's a large body of subs who were teachers in their own country… but they don't make the requirements here, in the United States, to teach in the classroom," he said, "If I'm going back to school to get my certificate as a teacher, and I can sub, I'm getting experience in the classroom, I'm making some money on the side, I'm learning the system." This means that there are substitutes with teaching experience in classrooms, and although they are not always teaching in their native languages, they do understand the content.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32128"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Furthermore, the new policy allows MCPS to build partnerships with local community colleges, specifically Montgomery College (MC), while potential substitutes work towards their degrees. MCPS has not yet elaborated on what this might look like.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS also predicts several other benefits as a result of this change. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS expects this change to increase the number of available substitutes; decrease unfilled vacancies; limit the need for in-school class coverage; lead to a more diverse range of candidates; and help build partnerships with local colleges while candidates earn their degree," it said in a </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/press/index.aspx?pagetype=showrelease&amp;id=8368&amp;type=&amp;startYear=&amp;pageNumber=&amp;mode=" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">press release</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Overall, there are many advantages that result from MCPS' decision for students, staff and subs. Sixty college credit hours is more than enough to be a successful substitute teacher.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32128
31537	Suspect is dead after an attempted robbery in Silver Spring	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At approximately 10:48 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 16, an attempted bank robbery took place at the BB&amp;T bank on Wayne Avenue in Downtown Silver Spring.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31536"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A suspect entered the bank manager's office and claimed he had a bomb in his backpack. He then threatened the manager with a gun as he demanded $20,000. A bank employee pressed the panic button, which notified the Montgomery County Police Department.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Upon hearing alarms and sirens, the suspect immediately fled the scene and ran into an alley before confronting police officers on Ramsey Avenue, after which he was shot and critically injured. The suspect was treated by medical staff on the scene and then transported to Holy Cross Hospital, where he died from his injuries.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Fire and Rescue squad is conducting a thorough bomb investigation with the goal of complete bomb deactivation.

32268	Why boundaries are being discussed and how they impact Blair.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For the first time in over 20 years, MCPS is taking a comprehensive look at school boundaries. The goal is multi-faceted: alleviating crowding problems, diversifying schools, and creating a more effective transportation pattern.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Former Student Member of the Board (SMOB) Ananya Tadikonda introduced the boundary issue to the Board of Education (BoE). The resolution― to bring in outside consultants to perform an analysis of whether existing school and cluster boundaries allow for effective use of school facilities―was approved on Jan. 8, 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">An update on the progress of the boundary analysis was given at the BoE meeting on Oct 8. Essie McGuire, Executive Director of the Chief Operating Officer, outlined the eight month project work plan slated to be completed by June 2020. There are several overlapping data analysis and community engagement steps.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Earlier this year, MCPS hosted a series of community meetings throughout the county to gather feedback about what the public would like to see as the focus of the analysis. At some meetings there was a lot of tension, with people fearing the movement of boundaries and fiercely objecting to an analysis taking place at all. At others, the public pushed for the analysis to focus on diversifying schools and eliminating crowding problems throughout the county.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">These discussions involving the major themes of equitable resources for all students, diversifying schools and solving overcrowding problems, will continue. The analysis has sparked opposition between students pushing for increased diversity in schools and parents who fear long bus rides for their children or decreased home values if boundaries shift (law of supply and demand; if boundaries shift and change the zoning of highly ranked schools, people will look to buy houses in the new school zone).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to the BoE the biggest issue when discussing boundary analysis is public misinformation. Jeanette Dixon, a member of the BoE, wants to put a halt to rumors that have no basis, but still surface anytime people discuss boundaries.&nbsp;“I do read the Bethesda Beat daily and the comments that are on [their stories] - some of them are quite offensive and prescribe motives to the Board that we don’t have,” Dixon says. Parents are concerned that the BoE wants to bus children from one side of the county to another or send their kids to a poorly ranked school. However, this is simply not going on right now.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith echoes the need to advocate for correctness. “We need to blanket our community with accurate information. No one should be able to say we didn't know; they could say I disagree, but not I didn't have the information," Smith says. Resources will be coming out to keep the public informed, but it is a general necessity for people to stick to the facts.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To reiterate, the analysis is not going to make any recommendations on specific school boundaries. Rather, it simply focuses on specific factors that MCPS should take into consideration in future boundary decisions. Integrating schools and overcrowding seem to be the topics that are currently at the top of the list.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">So how does Blair fit in? Blair is the county’s highest populated school, with a student body of nearly 3400. It is nearing capacity, with 10 classes already being taught in portables. Furthermore, as of July 1, the county implemented a one year moratorium to build houses in the MBHS cluster, in attempts to prevent school overcrowding.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32267"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s population is projected to reach 3600 students in the next few years, but the current facility does not have the ability to accommodate that many students. On the other hand, schools further out have plenty of empty seats. Seneca Valley High School has a brand-new building designed for 2400 students, but only has around 1200 students enrolled.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is clear that this is a problem. Boundary analysis stands to solve issues exactly like this one. By recognizing all the flaws with the system in the status quo, MCPS will be in a better position to resolve them. To stay up-to-date with the analysis, visit the MCPS website or tune into BoE meetings. Alternatively, attend the public hearings on Nov. 18 to provide input.</span></p><p><br></p>	32267
33616	Swift is in the process of re-recording her albums going back to 2006	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Taylor Swift, one of the music industry’s leading superstars, started her career at the young age of 16 years old with a debut album that topped the charts. She is now re-recording everything from her first to sixth albums, but why bother re-releasing her life's work? The answer lies in the complicated morality of business deals that she signed at the beginning of her career.</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425?lang=en" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">In a post to all her social media platforms on Nov. 19, 2019</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Swift announced that her masters was being bought by Scooter Braun. In the music industry, masters is the overarching term that describes the full rights to a record or album; whoever owns the masters has complete control over what is done with the music. The deal was part of Braun's acquisition of Big Machine Records, a record label company which Swift was part of. Through obtaining the entirety of Big Machine Records, Braun was able to also own Swift's masters, thereby being able to have full control.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As for Braun, he and Swift have a long, complicated relationship. Braun is the manager for many other pop stars such as Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber, with the latter having feuded with Swift. For instance, back in 2016, Bieber shaded Swift and sided with Kanye West by weighing in on the Swift vs West feud -- who can forget the #TaylorSwiftisOverParty? Bieber had </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7460844/justin-bieber-kanye-west-taylor-swift-what-up" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">posted a selfie on Instagram</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of himself, Braun and West together on a Facetime call captioned with "Taylor Swift what up." This move involved both Bieber, who is a client of Braun, and Braun himself into the argument. Hence, when Swift found out that Braun, someone who publicly took a stand against her, had the power to control her first six albums, it did not bode well with her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Swift claims that she did not know about the sale of her masters to Braun until the statement was made public. "I found out when it hit the news," Swift said in a "CBS Sunday Morning" interview in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, when Swift heard the news about her enemy Braun owning her masters, she was furious and made it clear that she would re-record her songs in order to get her art back. When she took this to social media, her stans were also not overjoyed but still supportive of her. "Combat, we're going to combat," </span><a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1328471874318311425?lang=en" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">one user on Twitter writes,</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> a lyrical reference to one of Swift's songs, showing that her fans would have her back in this matter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair freshman Sophia Ge agrees with Swift's decision to re-record her songs and her fans' decisions to support her. "I honestly think she's right to re-record her own music and her, like, own whole work! When she does re-record, she'll be able to get control of her things, full stop, you know?" Ge says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hence, when Swift learned that she couldn't get her masters back, she opted for the next best option: to re-record them and have fans listen to her new versions, the ones she would own.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On April 9, Swift released her first re-recorded album, "Fearless (Taylor's Version)."&nbsp;In her new version, she added 6 new never-before-heard "From The Vault" songs. These are songs that were written during the original album's era and fit into the album's theme, but never made the cut to be on the old 2008 version.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Interestingly enough, just last Friday, Swift surprise-dropped her version of the 2014 single "Wildest Dreams," from her record-breaking fourth album "1989." The Wildest Dreams trend on TikTok has been taking off and Swift wanted fans to use her version of the pop anthem for the trend. Love it or hate it, Taylor Swift recognizes TikTok's ability to boost a song on the charts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Swift has personally left comments on some TikToks that use "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)."&nbsp;"This is so beautiful I feel like it can't be real, I for sure imagined it," Swift </span><a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMR3UpgkM/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">comments on one user's TikTok</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fans love Swift's new version of "Wildest Dreams." "I love the 'Taylor's Version' of [Wildest Dreams]... Of course, the old one was still really good but her diction, quality and voice just all sound a lot better in the new version," Ge comments.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, is "Taylor's Version" a success?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The short answer is yes. Swift's hardcore fanbase, also known as "Swifties," are helping her achieve her goals. Swift herself addressed the success of her first re-released album, which broke records and made history in recent years. "You all really went out and left my greatest expectations in shambles this week…&nbsp;you made Fearless (my version) the biggest country album first week of the last 6 years and the top release of 2021 so far," </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNu8rybDtrn/?utm_medium=copy_link" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Swift wrote in an Instagram post a week after dropping the album.&nbsp;</a></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Furthermore, on the first day with just 11 hours of tracking, Swifties were able to stream the "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)" over 3.4 million times on Spotify. Perhaps not even in Swift's </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">wildest dreams</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> did she realize the extent of which her fans would go to support her.&nbsp;</span></p><p>With this in mind, the next time you feel like dancing out your heart or crying out your soul to T-Swizzle, you might want to check out the “Taylor's Version”<em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">of the same songs. Don't forget to keep your eyes open for Nov. 19 at midnight, which is when Swift's re-recorded version of her album "Red" is released - the album which spawned hit singles such as "I Knew You Were Trouble", "22" (go Blair's Class of '22!). Additionally, in the Wildest Dreams trend on TikTok, you might want to use the "Taylor's Version" of the song just in case Swift herself decides to drop a comment on your post.</span></p>	33615
32770	With the recent school closing, all educational instruction has stopped	<p>Due to the closing of all schools in Maryland from Monday, March 16 to Friday, March 27, all educational work has stopped and is mandated by the county to be optional. As of March 16, all grades in the gradebook are frozen until further notice, Montgomery Blair Principal Renay Johnson said.</p><p>In an email sent out to staff members, Johnson reiterated the point that teachers are not allowed, under any circumstances, to assign mandatory work to be completed during this two-week break period. “Do not assign any assignments during this absence or expect students to complete your coursework. Students can complete optional assignments from the Office of Curriculum and Instructional Programs. These optional assignments will not be graded,” Johnson said.</p><p>However, teachers are encouraged to use this time to allow students to re-submit or catch up on late work. “If it was assigned before break, or if it is make-up work, then that is fine. It is also time for teachers to catch up on grading. If they haven’t graded anything all quarter, now is a good time for them to start. But, nothing new can be graded,” Johnson continued.</p><p>Some acceptable forms of educational instruction include optional videos that students can watch to keep information fresh in their minds (i.e. optional foreign language or math videos). For grades K-12, the MCPS Office of Curriculum Instruction has also put out optional material for high school students to complete, if desired. These materials can be found here and include instruction in english, math, science, social studies, world languages and AP/IB material.</p><p>MCPS is currently unsure whether or not the marking period will be extended. “MCPS will consult with union leaders to determine what adjustments need to be made to the 3rd marking period window,” Johnson said.</p><p>Johnson and the Blair administration are constantly communicating with the county and state about continued school closings and further information regarding online instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>UPDATE (3/22/20, 10:00 p.m.): In a statement released on Sunday March 22, MCPS Superintendent Jack Smith announced that MCPS will be launching a "distance learning system" on March 30. "We will launch the first phase of a distance learning system so that students can begin to have structured school experiences. A system that will provide multiple ways to access learning for a variety of students," Smith <a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/publicinfo/community/school-year-2019-2020/allin-this-together-20200322.html" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>UPDATE (3/25/20, 11:42 a.m.): In a statement released by MCPS, "all MCPS school buildings will be closed until April 24, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

32077	A legacy of diversity, participation and acceptance in the workforce	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As September comes to a close, we are already halfway into National Hispanic American Heritage Month. Just last week, a high-energy performance by the </span><a href="https://nfuzionmusic.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Nfuzion Latin Band</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> got Blazers singing and dancing to the beat at Blair's National Hispanic Heritage Month kickoff.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, Hispanic Heritage Month isn't just about music or culture. This special month is about appreciating the contributions of the Hispanic American community to the greater community of America.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Today, we know of America as the land of diversity, participation and acceptance. But this has not always been the case.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When Samuel Gompers founded the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1886, he hoped </span><a href="https://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h4002.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">to protect the working class from poor working conditions</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> without discrimination on account of color. But the AFL's stand on racial integration did not prove to last. By 1895, AFL affiliates were preventing people of color from joining their ranks. Someone had to take action.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Santiago Iglesias was the first to step up for the job.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Iglesias was born on Feb. 22, 1872 in La Coruña, Spain. Both his parents were laborers; his father was a carpenter, and his mother worked in a cigar factory. By the age of 12, Iglesias left school to become a carpenter's apprentice where he subsequently masterminded his first violent strike against his employer.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Iglesias went on to become a fierce labor organizer. His tireless efforts to improve working conditions in Puerto Rico landed him in trouble with the Spanish government, which controlled Puerto Rico at the time. He was even sent to prison for his pro-labor ideas. But these trials could not stop Iglesias. In 1899, he founded the Federación Libre de los Trabajadores (FLT) to fight against the negative influence of politics on the workforce.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When the United States acquired Puerto Rico in 1898, Iglesias discovered an opportunity to make a lasting mark. At a convention at Louisville, he delivered a speech, which called out the violence and mistreatment of Puerto Rican laborers who were "</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/980224.pdf?casa_token=nBVrId4E8LoAAAAA:pJ99tP5axJSSo0_Kg4st1an14rFuddsehrUFBOhRXSI4-xx269pOsz3hJIU_34FKyqvQK-09xdfaUvU5Hp2_9tdgpteibWk_X111ld44d1HPDXoJNQ" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">kicked and cuffed and imprisoned</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">" without a cause.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32068"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">His skillful oration caught the attention of Gompers who subsequently provided funds to help organize labor unions in Puerto Rico. This allowed the FLT to become affiliated with AFL in 1901. Iglesias was then appointed to the general organizer of AFL for Puerto Rico. This was AFL's first step towards its new policy of racial integration. The formerly discriminatory AFL, thanks to Iglesias, evolved into an organization that fought for the rights of minorities. And finally, in 1964, AFL and the Congress of Industrial Organizations </span><a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/unions/social/african-americans-rights" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">provided critical lobbying support</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for the Civil Rights Acts and Voting Rights Act, two major steps towards a more equitable society.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Iglesias's enduring fight for labor rights led to the racial integration of labor unions, which played a major role in the Civil Rights Movement. As we appreciate and celebrate the inclusion and diversity of our society, let us look back at the figures in history who helped shape the America we know today. In the words of his son-in-law, Iglesias was "a live wire, a human dynamo, a hard worker, a bold fighter, beloved leader and far-sighted statesman at the service of the people."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32068

31919	Cap decorations would serve as an outlet for expression and individuality	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A few weeks ago, Blair seniors gathered in the auditorium for a discussion of important upcoming dates and deadlines. While reviewing graduation details, many seniors were made aware of a confusing, yet firm rule: seniors are prohibited from decorating their caps, in any manner, over concerns over inappropriate designs. Yet, simply put, students should be able to express themselves through their caps.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On a daily basis, clothing serves as an outlet for personal style and creativity. Our clothes allow us to define ourselves as individual students among thousands of others. Yet while we are allowed to celebrate the diversity in our personalities through our attire choices, the limiting cap decoration policy implies that this diversity is not nearly as important on one of the most critical days of our life: graduation. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As we walk across the stage, our families excitedly gather to recognize our achievements spanning the past four years, but no one shares the same journey, same accomplishments, or same dreams throughout high school. It should follow that we be allowed a chance to represent our distinct ideas and insights as we make our way towards the platform, whether it be the </span><a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/ideas/graduation-cap-ideas/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">logo of our future college, a graduation pun, or our favorite quote</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Beyond allowing for a myriad of creative possibilities, cap decorations might also help make large graduating classes seem smaller. In fact, this year’s tremendous graduating class of nearly 800 Blazers is the largest in Maryland. Given the sheer quantity of students with class sizes that appear to be</span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/regulatoryaccountability/glance/currentyear/schools/04757.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"> growing annually,</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> unique cap decorations could allow students to feel uniquely special, rather than simply a face (and cap!) in the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Moreover, the no-decoration policy is not implemented countywide, as other MCPS schools allow students to express themselves creatively on their graduation day. A </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/schools/damascushs/news/2019%20Senior%20End%20of%20Year%20Events.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">senior planning document</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> from Damascus High School for the 2018-2019 school year reveals that students may decorate their caps, so long as the decorations “meet the expectations of the Damascus High School and MCPS Code of Conduct”. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The main concern over cap decoration appears to stem from the potential for improper designs, such as obscenity or inappropriate symbols that may offend Blair’s diverse array of families at graduation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“At Blair we have over 93 different nationalities in our population and someone saying something as silly as ‘good luck’ in another language could be offensive to other people,” principal Renay Johnson says. “It’s my responsibility to make sure that, number one, students can choose their gown, red or white, but also to make sure that it’s a dignified event and families feel celebrated and no one sees something as a derogatory term.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As an alternative to eliminating all cap designs, Blair administration could implement an improved policy where seniors interested in adorning their caps be required to have their decoration pre-approved instead. In this way, students could still express their creativity or excitement without feeling constrained while still satisfying school requirements. Taking into consideration the limited time between cap and gown pickup and graduation, an alternate solution could involve a policy where staff members check and approve students’ caps as they enter the building for graduation, confiscating any caps with offensive designs. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the bright side, Blair administration has been flexible in the past in changing graduation-attire policies. Although female students traditionally adorned white gowns while males wore red for many years, it was only a few years ago in 2016 that this rule was modernized so that students could select gowns </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/blair-opens-cap-and-gown-color-options-to-all-genders-30496/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">in the color of their choice</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Perhaps with sufficient discussion and improvements such as the pre-approval requirement, the decoration policy could also be updated as necessary. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whether it be a way to appreciate the diversity of Blair students, an opportunity to make a large student body feel smaller, or simply a fun activity for severe senioritis victims, cap decorations holds numerous invaluable possibilities. Going forward, we should work with Blair staff to ensure we can positively express ourselves without crossing the line. Design or no design, we can all agree that graduation is an event to be cherished.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31918
32821	Amid the coronavirus pandemic, sports leagues have been halted and the future is unknown	<p>The coronavirus pandemic has been a time of extreme uncertainty. The world of sports has been completely stopped. Every major sports league has been suspended. According to ESPN, the XFL doesn't have plans set for their second season in 2021 and they have since gone into bankruptcy.</p><p>It all started on March 11 at 9:27 P.M., when Utah Jazz all-star center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 before a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, which suspended that game and kept the two teams quarantined in Chesapeake Energy Arena. Four minutes later, the NBA suspended their season.&nbsp;</p><p>Gobert notoriously made a joke out of the coronavirus at first. Publicly, after a press conference, he jokingly touched all of the microphones at the podium. There were also reports that Gobert would touch players and their belongings, and on March 12, Jazz teammate Donovan Mitchell tested positive.</p><p>According to HoopsRumors, the NBA has considered resuming their season at Walt Disney World or in Las Vegas. The hotel at Walt Disney World will have plenty of room to hold all 30 NBA teams, the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex can hold several courts (which can be broadcast-ready), and professional sports have been considered essential in Florida. For the time being, the NBA plans to open certain team facilities, starting May 8, limited to four players at a time and no coaches.</p><p>The NBA has also discussed pushing back the 2020-21 season. "The league wanted to have the Finals wrapped up ideally by Labor Day Weekend. They are more willing than ever to delay the start of next season, part of that reason is that it might give them more time next year to be able to have fans in the building," ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said to Scott Van Pelt. On May 4, The Athletic NBA tweeted that the 2020-21 NBA season may begin on Christmas Day.</p><p>Opening Day for the MLB was meant to be on March 26, but of course, it too was canceled. The popular plan for their season to start is known as the "Arizona plan." According to CBS Sports, all 30 teams would be quarantined in Phoenix, and games would be played in the ten spring training stadiums as well as Chase Field, the Diamondbacks' stadium. Players would likely take a pay cut and have weekly COVID-19 tests.</p><p>As of right now, the NFL doesn't have plans to change the season which plans to open on Sept. 10 and end on Feb. 7, 2021. According to CBS Sports, there have been discussions of having a season start in mid-October with no bye weeks. There may also be games all played in one location, like the MLB.</p><p>The NHL has a pretty aggressive plan to return to practice May 15, with training camps in June, the regular season resuming in July, and the Stanley Cup in September, according to the Boston Globe, but no official decisions have been made.</p><p>The start of the WNBA season has been delayed, and their draft was held remotely. They had a designated break for the Olympics, so that may provide them some leeway for scheduling some games without fans during that time since the Olympics will be postponed until July 2021, but there have been no rumors or official decisions.</p><p>The near future of professional sports is widely unknown. Whether sports leagues will prioritize finishing the season, or waiting to have spectators will be a debate. Ultimately, the leagues have recognized that the safety of their members and fans is of the utmost importance during this time.</p><p><br></p>	32820
32387	Discussing the best ways to improve your fantasy squad before the playoffs	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are still five weeks until the National Football League (NFL) playoffs, but fantasy football playoffs are here—and depending how much money you have on the line, they might be even more important. In order to win your fantasy playoffs, you'll need the best players you can get your hands on. SCO has you covered with the best players available, the best players to trade for and the most valuable fantasy players. This guide will help you on your journey to the championship and the glory that follows.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32386"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Top fantasy free agents</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Currently, the three most valuable free agents are Lions running back Bo Scarbrough, Titans wide receiver AJ Brown and Colts quarterback Jacoby Brissett. They have all been putting up solid stats and are owned by less than 50 percent in the fantasy leagues.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Bo Scarbrough became the Lions’ starting back following Kerryon Johnson’s season-ending injury. Although the Lions don't have the best run game, Scarbrough gets 15 touches per game, which makes him a good flex player and an average second running back.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">AJ Brown isn't the most consistent wide receiver, but he has major potential to get a lot of points with multiple long touchdown receptions this season. Due to his ability to put up big numbers that can make or break a game, Brown is a good option if you are the underdog in your playoff matchup.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jacoby Brissett has been banged up throughout the season, but he is a strong quarterback capable of putting up consistent numbers when he is healthy.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Top players to trade for</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The players that could be acquired for cheap heading into week 14 are Nick Chubb, Evan Engram and Tyler Lockett—all great players who you can get for cheap due to recent injuries or inconsistent play.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nick Chubb is the best player out of these three, but fantasy owners are afraid that Kareem Hunt's increasing workload will detract from Chubb. However, Chubb is still a top-ten fantasy back and he gets plenty of touches. Getting him for a more consistent running back like Mark Ingram would be a steal.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If you need a tight end and don't want to give up much, Engram is your guy. Engram is yet again struggling with injury problems, but when he is healthy, he is a top-five tight end. He is also looking to come back within the next two weeks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Seahawks’ wide receiver Tyler Lockett is Russell Wilson's go-to guy and has been putting up great numbers. As of late, however, he hasn't been getting the ball as much. There isn't a clear explanation for his lack of production, but some of it could be attributed to the great playing of fellow Seahawks’ wide receiver DK Metcalf. However, Lockett is still one of the best receivers in the league, and now is the perfect time to trade for him.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Most valuable players to have</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The best fantasy players to have on your team right now are Lamar Jackson, Derrick Henry and Christian McCaffrey. If you have any of these players, your fantasy football team is looking good.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lamar Jackson is the best fantasy quarterback and debatably the best quarterback in the league. He has been putting up insane numbers through the air and on the ground, averaging multiple touchdowns and over 200 total yards per game. He was a surprise to many this year, but Jackson continues to put up great numbers every game.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is officially Derrick Henry's season and he is better than ever. Henry has only had one game without either a touchdown or 100 yards. The past four weeks, Henry has put up 20+ fantasy points per game, and is peaking at the perfect time for playoff fantasy owners.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Christian McCaffrey has been the best running back by far all season, and it looks like he will not slow down. He gets touches both on the ground and in the air, and basically makes up the entire Panthers offense. It is clear to all fantasy owners that he is the guy to have.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hopefully these suggestions are helpful to your fantasy team. I wish you the best of luck in your path through the fantasy playoffs!</span></p>	32386
31969	Disney’s latest live-action movie depicts realistic animals for an unrealistic direction	<p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Following the trend of Disney’s previous live-action remakes, viewers expected </span><em style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">The Lion King</em><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;"> to include amazing music, breathtaking scenery and childhood nostalgia</span><em style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">. </em><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">With an incredibly talented cast voicing the film and singing the popular soundtrack, it was almost certain that</span><em style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;"> </em><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">the film would excel in all three aspects. Unfortunately, the film </span><em style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">only</em><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;"> succeeded in these</span><em style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;"> </em><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">three aspects.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">The movie follows lion cub Simba (JD McCrary) as he grows into an adult (Donald Glover) and becomes next in line to rule the Pride Lands of Africa following his father, King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Mufasa’s brother and previous heir to the throne, tries anything he can to get his power back— deception, threats, and even murder.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31968"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">The beginning of the movie immediately hooks viewers with its iconic chant of “Nants ingonyama” (here comes a lion), which is accompanied by beautiful illustrations of the African landscape and the cast belting out “The Circle of Life.” The familiar scene of Rafiki (John Kani) lifting Simba into the air on Pride Rock captivates the audience and ends the introduction of the film.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Excitement turns to disenchantment as soon as the animals begin to talk. It’s impossible not to laugh at how awkward the realistic animals look as they speak and act like humans.What do nostalgia, music and scenery mean when the attention is on a bizarre hyena opening and closing its mouth? The movie attempts to simultaneously portray the animals as authentic and human-like, leading to inconsistent behavior. There is a mixture of actual growling and poor imitations of animal noises made by the voice actors.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Replacing the animated characters with photo-realistic computer-generated imagery (CGI) animals also makes it difficult to read facial expressions. While artists can draw exaggerated emotions on cartoon animals, animals like birds and warthogs usually don’t express themselves with human emotions. Through most of the torment he faces, Simba seems to pull a straight face. The scenes rely on only the actors’ voices to relay their characters' emotions. Though the characters are well-developed and the actors convey emotions well, the CGI dulls any emotion.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Despite the shortcomings of the on-screen characters, the music and illustrations entertain and impress throughout the movie. The cast brings the film to life through playful and upbeat songs, including classics like “I Just Can’t Wait To Be King” and “Hakuna Matata.” The background music adds emotion and intensity to moments of conflict and increases suspense before important events in the story. Every frame is drawn with great attention to detail, from each water droplet on a spiderweb to the vast expanse of the night sky.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">The Lion King</em><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;"> is well produced and reminiscent of the classic. The familiar storyline is enhanced by skillful artists and voice actors. Regardless, Disney’s decision to personify realistic-looking animals in the first place is questionable.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<em style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">The Lion King is rated PG for sequences of violence, peril and some thematic elements and is playing at Regal Majestic &amp; IMAX in Silver Spring and ArcLight Cinemas in Bethesda.</em></p><p><br></p>	31968
32233	An inside look into how teachers and counselors write college recommendations	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With the early round of college applications due Friday, the stress has officially began. Students attempt to perfect every aspect of their application before clicking "submit," but one thing is out of their control: teacher and counselor recommendations. These recommendation letters provide admission officers with an outside perspective of a student and how they interact with classmates and approach learning.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32232"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So what exactly goes into writing a college recommendation? With the mounting importance of such a letter, every teacher has a different approach to writing the best college recommendation possible. Biology teacher Elizabeth Duval likes to write the bulk of a letter in one sitting and then edit it later. “I work </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">sometimes with music, sometimes with a show I have seen 1000 times on Netflix that I can ignore, but I like to have background noise,” Duval says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Surprisingly, teachers stress over recommendations just as much as students. </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">They feel a lot of pressure to showcase the qualities of each unique individual and sell a student to a college. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“How are you going to honestly present these [qualities] of a student?” social studies teacher Anne Manuel asks. </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">“Sometimes I don’t have the vocabulary to describe how wonderful this kid is. Once I reach a block like that, I will stop and come back to it, maybe three days later."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This leaves one question: Who should a student ask to write their letter? When deciding who will write the best recommendation, students must consider which teachers have seen their personal growth in character and/or academics. If possible, a good teacher to ask would be someone one has had both as an underclassman and an upperclassmen. This way, teachers can craft a more dynamic recommendation, highlighting a student's improvement throughout high school.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">English teacher Michael Horne writes his recommendation letters to always present an honest and fair representation of that particular student. “It’s something you put your name on, so it has to be something you stand behind. Every teacher is trying to celebrate the accomplishments and strides made in class,” Horne says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teachers also give students a say in their college recommendation letter—to an extent. “I give out a questionnaire where I ask students what they want me to emphasize to colleges. However, I try not to write about activities outside of the classroom that I am not involved in. If I’m not involved in it, why would I talk about it?” Duval says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In contrast with teachers, counselor recommendations are even more unpredictable. Students are assigned a counselor when entering Blair who will write their recommendation. At a big school like Blair, it can be a challenge to get to know your counselor personally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair counselor Kirk Simms writes recommendations for seniors with last names Bm to C. This includes 62 seniors, 55 of whom he will end up writing a recommendation for. In the beginning of senior year and end of junior year, students tell counselors about themselves through a Trailblazer packet, which contains a senior brag sheet, parent questionnaire and resume. Simms also recommends students to check in with their counselor roughly twice a month to discuss courses or grade reports.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even with the sheer number of letters to write, Simms is proud of getting to know each senior personally. “I take pride in writing each of them a good letter to sell them to the university,” Simms says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the extra work and time college recommendations require every fall, teachers ultimately use recommendations to help students along on their path to higher education. This college application season, instead of thinking of teacher recommendations as an uncontrollable, intimidating factor, think of it as a way to show colleges another dimension of personality.</span></p>	32232
32010	A guide to taking a safe dip in local waters.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Just around a month ago, Brittany Carey's pleasant </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-maryland-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">family trip</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to Ocean City took a deadly turn.

As summer 2019 draws to a close, you may be thinking of sneaking in one last beach trip, but let's not get too hasty. With all these reports, it is essential to take certain precautions to enjoy a fun and safe trip to the waters.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Drumroll… Silver Chips Online is here to guide you through your summer beach experience. Keep the below guidelines in mind to make sure that your "dream" vacation goes smoothly.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent;">1.Use common sense.</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This goes without saying, but please use common sense.

Use soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub to clean all cuts and injuries that may have been exposed to contaminated water. Finally, cover all wounds with a clean, dry bandage.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent;">3.Don't eat raw sea animals.</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">...Especially shellfish.

33151	There is nothing just about the Department of Justice's suit against Yale's use of affirmative action	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This fall, as seniors scramble to submit their college applications, many find themselves checking off a box to indicate their race—wondering what their answer will mean for their admission prospects. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) apparently has a very good idea of that.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Aug. 13, based on aggressive lobbying from the Asian American Coalition for Education and other similar organizations, the DOJ accused Yale University of violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination of federal funds on the basis of race, color, and national origin. The DOJ contended that by favoring non-Asian and non-white applicants through affirmative action, Yale’s admissions process was unconstitutional.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yale has always maintained that though they take race into account when choosing students to accept, they focus more on a student’s holistic application, as confirmed on their admissions website. Yale—and universities with similar affirmative action policies—are completely justified in considering an applicant's race during the admissions process, as it factors in years of systemic racism and creates a more diverse student body.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33150"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ignoring race and income altogether will further uphold the opportunity gap, entrenching families in a generational cycle of poverty. While it may be nice to envision a world in which race-blind admissions are perfectly fair and all races are treated equally and grow up in the same circumstances, that is not a reality that has ever existed in the United States.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Kanayo Duru, who is Black, pointed out that affirmative action helps to combat the implicit bias of many employers and admissions officers. “From college admissions officers to hiring committees, a lot of people have prejudices against [Black and Indigenous people of color],” Duru said, “even if they don’t realize them.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The DOJ brings forth a case that holds no judicial precedent; the Supreme Court of the United States has time and time again ruled in favor of the use of affirmative action. Fisher vs. University of Texas (2016) and Grutter vs. Bollinger (2003)</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">both ruled that universities may consider race in their admissions process, so long as it is not the deciding factor in admissions. It clearly isn’t for Yale—just look at their demographics. Despite affirmative action, over half of their student body is white, about 20 percent is Asian, 13.3 percent is Hispanic (of any race), and only 7.7 percent is Black.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In an email to the Yale community on Aug. 13, following the DOJ’s accusation, university president Peter Salovey wrote, “We will continue to look at the whole person when selecting whom to admit … [and] will continue to create a student body that is rich in a diverse range of ideas, expertise and experiences.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Peter Smith, a former Yale admissions officer, current faculty member at The George Washington University Law School, and expert in constitutional law, defended Yale’s use of affirmative action in an email to Silver Chips. “The best analogy,” Smith wrote, “is to a race in which some of the participants are forced to start 50 meters behind the other runners, with a heavy weight tied to their ankles. Affirmative action seeks to lessen that weight.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The U.S. has suppressed its Black population since its establishment. Affirmative action presents itself as a tool to level the playing field and consider the impacts of that oppression on the college application process.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights reports that in 2011, only about 57 percent of Black students and 67 percent of Latinx students could access courses necessary for college readiness,</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">such as basic secondary science classes like biology and chemistry, compared to 71 percent of white and 81 percent of Asian students. Yale must not look past the fact that many Black and Latinx youth lack proper access to essential resources going into higher education, and should keep making active efforts to include racial minorities on their campus.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A diverse group of people creates more open-minded and prepared citizens. They will enter society and the workforce as understanding individuals who are willing to learn about the perspectives of others, as confirmed by the American Council on Education (ACE).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Education within a diverse setting prepares students to become good citizens in an increasingly complex, pluralistic society,” the ACE wrote in a board diversity statement on the Importance of Diversity in Higher Education. When attending any university, students should be immersed in a diverse and inclusive community with students who can share unique experiences and perspectives.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Alice Park, a current student at Yale and alumna of Silver Chips, agreed that diversity matters on campus and described other ways Yale is trying to open up their application process to minority students. “There's a lot of efforts to get more underrepresented groups applying to Yale,” said Park. “We have admissions ambassadors who go to high schools where no one has been to Yale in a long time.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As part of their investigation, the DOJ demanded that Yale employ race-blind admissions for the current 2020-2021 application cycle. This is unreasonable—and it is an immense disservice to students. It could very well take away from their abilities to learn from one another by creating a homogeneous freshman class. Yale’s goal in their use of affirmative action is to create a diverse student body and to help level the playing field between races. In order to do that, race needs to be considered.</span></p>	33150

31642	Only 16 points were scored but the championship still had some incredible moments.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Super Bowl LIII is considered by many to be one of the worst Super Bowls of all-time. The New England Patriots won their sixth title in franchise history, beating the Los Angeles Rams 13-3. Personally, as a fan who loves to see high flying offenses run all over the field, this game was a bit of a let down. The biggest offensive play came in the form of a crucial 29-yard pitch and catch from Tom Brady to Rob Gronkowski, which set up the only touchdown of the game. So yeah, it wasn't my favorite Super Bowl, but there has arguably never been a Super Bowl or even a game, as masterfully coached and executed like the one we watched on Feb. 3. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the regular season, Los Angeles was </span><a href="http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?seasonType=REG&amp;offensiveStatisticCategory=RUSHING&amp;d-447263-n=1&amp;d-447263-o=2&amp;d-447263-p=1&amp;d-447263-s=RUSHING_YARDS&amp;tabSeq=2&amp;season=2018&amp;role=TM&amp;Submit=Go&amp;archive=false&amp;conference=null&amp;defensiveStatisticCategory=null&amp;qualified=false" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">second in total offense</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, third in rushing and second in points per game, numbers that don't indicate an offensive flop during the biggest moment of the season. Todd Gurley was big part of those offensive numbers, having another MVP campaign during 2018. But, he was hurt during the postseason and never reached his full potential, getting only ten touches during the biggest game of the year. The Rams were not at full strength but they still had a top-caliber offensive team. Nonetheless, Bill Belichick, the 66-year old head coach of the Patriots proved why he is the greatest defensive play-caller of all-time. Belichick pulled off the biggest shocker in Super Bowl history, limiting the Rams to just three points and 260 yards. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The game was a spectacular defensive masterpiece, a fascinating show of pure football knowledge and skill. Just look at some of the plays made by the Patriots defense. Devin McCourty's chase down separation of what looked like an easy Brandin Cooks touchdown was one of the best defensive plays we have had seen all year. Stephon Gilmore, who should have been named MVP due to his dominant performance, also came up clutch with a red-zone pick of Jared Goff to effectively seal the game for the Patriots. The defense on both sides was spectacular and made the game more intriguing than people are giving it credit for. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many "bored" viewers did not even notice that the score was tied heading into the fourth quarter. There was not a lot of scoring but at least it was a close game. Those of us who don't have a team in the game really just want a exciting finish. We got that with Super Bowl LIII. As a matter of fact, when the LA kicker Greg Zuerlein made a 53-yard field goal to tie it up at three, it sure seemed like this was going to be a riveting last frame.&nbsp;I confess that I was expecting more. But in the grand context of things, what can top the last two Super Bowls? We were blessed with two of the best NFL games ever, filled with 50-yard bombs and gripping comebacks. This year we were handed a mediocre championship that still had some intrigue and excitement. Fans don't like slow games like this, but defense is part of the game just as much as offense. It is time that we appreciate Super Bowl LIII for what it was; another opportunity for us to witness the greatest coach and player duo of all time. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31641"></div><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31641
32600	Information on the exciting classes available for students in the 2020-21 school year	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every Blazer is familiar with the bright yellow class form that comes around each year and the indecision that comes with choosing new electives. If the lengthy list of exciting electives isn't already difficult to choose from or you're looking to try something completely new, read below for descriptions on new classes that will be available next school year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Printmaking A and B</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Printmaking gives students the opportunity to create two-dimensional art through a non-traditional technique. "There's going to be a lot of etching and using random materials you wouldn't even think about using to make art," fine arts resource teacher Jacqueline Armstead-Thomas says. The class infuses printmaking projects with art history and ensures that students have sufficient time to work on their art and develop their skills.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Armstead-Thomas adds that students should take a fine arts class such as printmaking to improve their school day. "It's a really great way for students to build in mindfulness during their day," she says.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Political Psychology and Behavior</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This new course focuses on&nbsp;social psychology to examine the underlying motives behind current and historical events. "It’s a question I always have when I teach my other classes," history teacher Sean Gabaree says. "When we study US history or world history, people do rotten things to each other, and we never have the opportunity to delve into it."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gabaree plans on examining recent events through videos and news articles, pairing each topic with a concept from social psychology. "Why are people acting this way, why are we treating each other this way, why aren't we doing something about it? We're going to introduce concepts from social psychology to try and answer those questions." The class will also study the&nbsp;reasons behind the Holocaust, atrocities in Vietnam and other wars. It also covers recent events such as implicit bias by the police force and the role campaign ads play in polarization.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Graphic Novel Literature</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This English course analyzes popular Japanese anime and film, such as Seven Samurai, Ghost in the Shell, Hachiko and other favorites. "Lately I've noticed so many students are taking Japanese for anime- they love anime and want to understand it," Japanese teacher Yoko Zoll says. She decided to pitch the class for next year after realizing her students' interest in Japanese entertainment.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32599"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The course also explores American renditions of Japanese film. "There are so many American movies that copied Japanese anime and films, so I thought it would be a good course to compare and contrast," Zoll says. At the end of the year, students will also make their own film or anime as a final project.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Future of Programming</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This project-based programming class studies experimental coding languages such as Scala, R, HTC, Rust, and Kotlin. "[The class] is going to explore emerging technologies in terms of newer languages that are gaining adoption with large tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook to ensure that students are up to speed and knowledgeable about the latest developments," computer science teacher Ryan Foster says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The course prepares students for the workforce by teaching them languages that they would be using in the tech industry. "Most schools don’t go beyond Java and Python, which are older languages," Foster says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Blazers interested in these courses should sign up by talking to their counselor. Each of these new courses will have passionate teachers devoted to teaching the class as well as peers who share similar interests.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	32599
32682	Retiring after 30 years at Blair primarily as a Health Education teacher	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Explain to me how opening a door is an accident? After 30 years at Blair primarily as a Health Education teacher, I am retiring. This semester, my last, I am teaching five study hall classes—all on the second floor. This is not a bad gig, but to be honest, I am not connected with my students in this environment. The majority of them come to class late every day (especially in first or second period) and most of them ask to use the bathroom every class. That’s right, I said most and I’ll stand by that. While I don’t have to grade papers or do a lot of the tedious tasks teachers usually complain about, I have been bored in class because I’m not teaching or answering questions except for “may I use the restroom?” My usefulness and identity had changed.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32616"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">So, back to my original question. I was in room 219 for first period last semester. A door adjoined my classroom to room 226. Throughout the semester, a student in 226 would start to open that door around the end of the period. My desk is positioned right next to it, and the door would hit my leg or my chair when opened even a few inches. This happened at the end of November, and when the door hit my chair I slammed it shut. A few students next-door laughed, commented rudely and opened the door again seconds later. This time I scooted my chair back, pulled open the door so I could see them and yelled at them to stop opening the door, to which one student replied defensively, “it was an accident.” I was too upset to laugh, so I said “stop lying to me and leave the door alone.” The student again replied, “why would I lie to you?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In hindsight, had I been less irritated and more thoughtful, as an adult in the situation, I should have calmly opened the door and explained with a smile on my face how their actions were causing a problem with the door hitting my leg or my chair. I’m certain that had I taken that course, the students may have understood and not been defensive. My point is that a lot has changed over 30 years of teaching, and when it comes to student behavior, most of the change is for the worse. Not too long ago, had a teacher similarly explained or yelled at a student for doing something they shouldn’t be, that teacher would have received an apology 90 percent of the time. Not a snarky comment, not a ridiculous lie trying to explain why they opened the door, but a “my bad” or “I’m sorry” or at the very least, “we didn’t know that you were sitting there.” All would have been more acceptable. And if you do get an apology nowadays, it’s usually at the behest of another teacher or administrator, so it’s forced and insincere.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Today's students are quick to use freedom of speech or excuses like “I wasn’t talking to you” in an effort to rationalize their use of inappropriate language. I’m not saying that all students behave this way. In fact, I have listened to stories of friends who teach elsewhere and have always felt that Blair students are ahead of the curve when it comes to such things. I </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">am</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> saying that this sort of behavior occurs more frequently than it used to, and that I am losing my tolerance for it in the days leading to my retirement.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Recently, all the rights and considerations are on the side of the students. Many more parents than in the past strongly support and defend their children whenever there is a conflict in school. The teacher has become a scapegoat in almost every confrontation; a babysitter walking on pins and needles, and in some cases, afraid to do or say the wrong thing. Perhaps this sounds like an overreaction. Am I making it up? Remember, I’ve been at this for 30 years.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students used to have certain dress codes to follow. As a teacher, I supported this. After all, Blair was my place of business for the last three decades, and hats and certain clothes were sometimes seen as too casual or controversial. Now, students wear whatever they want, and the hallways look more like a playground or a shopping mall than a business. In fact, the very notion of enforcing any sort of dress code today is seen as short-sighted and unenlightened. And what about cell phones? Student use of cell phones is out of control. Many students use them in class and as soon as class is over, they are on them in the hallways, reading texts or talking without watching where they are walking—sometimes stopping altogether while people are trying to walk behind or past them.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Of course, students have a strong voice in politics and social issues today. They can say whatever they want about their beliefs, even if it offends those with an alternate viewpoint. They even walk out of school a few times a year if they don’t like something about the world we live in. Language? The longer I have taught, the worse it’s gotten. Students routinely drop the f-bomb, the n-word other offensive terms in the hallways and in class without a second thought. Teachers and students alike should be upset with this, but it is so commonplace that it has become tolerated and ignored by all.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What makes all this possible is a systematic change in policy on the part of MCPS and Blair. Inappropriate language and rude behavior are not punished anymore, mostly because administrators have bigger fish to fry. And since students have figured this out, such behavior has been significantly ramped up.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a result, teachers have become very hesitant to report issues concerning language and behavior because they know that there will likely be no consequences for the students involved. Teachers also fear that reporting students when other teachers do not will make them appear like they cannot control their teaching environment. Since more and more behavior issues go unreported, administrators, who haven’t taught in an actual classroom in years, are pretty much unaware of how bad it has gotten.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Now if I sound old and out of touch, I will grant you that much. In many ways, I am old and out of touch, but if being in touch means being complacent with enabling student misconduct, I will proudly stay in the dark. I’m not saying everything I say is right and if you take the opposite point of view you are wrong. I’m saying there are things that I don’t enjoy about teaching as much as I used to, and it’s not just me. It’s every teacher in my office—those who have been teaching for 20+ years, those who have been teaching for five or fewer years and many others I have spoken with throughout the building. It’s the difference between being an idealist and a realist.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Now that I have ranted about some of the reasons that I am looking forward to my retirement, let me explain some of the things that I love about Blair HS. I was a student here. I graduated in 1980 from the Wayne Avenue location. I played varsity baseball and in my senior year, I was the Sports Editor of Silver Chips Print. We were awarded the Best Sports Page in the state that year. I began coaching JV baseball here in 1983 when I was just 21 years old and still in college.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I worked security for a semester here in the 80s and took over the varsity baseball program the day that I became a teacher in February of 1991. I served as the Assistant Athletic Director to Dale Miller from 1994-2011, when I resigned from both that position and the baseball job. I use the word “served” because athletic administration is a thankless endeavor. I worked three or four nights a week covering games in the fall and the winter, usually without ever being thanked by anyone for staying late and running the show. Rita Boule and her staff certainly know what I am talking about. I did it in service to the school that I love and for Dale—not for the stipend that came with it. I loved coaching, but I got out at the right time because things have changed in athletics since then. I went from being a coach of a great program and an athletic administrator who knew all the athletes to a teacher who quickly lost touch with Blair sports, its coaches and the athletes.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32617"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Around 2013, my baseball jersey was retired by the school. I am very disappointed that there is nothing to commemorate this, even though I requested a framing and placement of the jersey a couple of years ago and volunteered to pay for it myself. However, I am still extremely proud that I am the only Blair athlete or coach ever to be honored in that way, even though I know that there are others more deserving.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">My most lasting friendships today were formed when I was a student at Blair and I look back upon my high school years fondly. My loyalty to Blair began even before I was a student here. I remember walking to the field on Wayne Avenue as a junior high student, watching the 1975 and 1977 Basketball State Champions play throughout those years. Ex-Blair security guard Cedric Boatman played on the ’75 team and current security guard Jeff Seals played on the ’77 team.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As stated, my teaching experience was mostly great. I began as a physical education teacher, but was asked by my first RT, Joe Marosy, to be trained to teach health when it was just starting in Montgomery County sometime in the mid 90s. Switching from gym to health was difficult at first because there was no set curriculum. I had to invent lessons, grade a lot of papers, develop quizzes and learn the subject matter, but over the years, I came to love teaching health and found it a relevant and important class for students. I think I was a good teacher who taught real-life lessons and who was validated over the years by cards, emails and many nice sentiments from my students. Teaching health and the feedback that I received was just as uplifting and important to me as my coaching experience here.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I love most things about Blair HS. I loved it as a student and as a teacher. Circumstances made it difficult to love being a teacher at times, but some of that may have happened at any MCPS school with the permissive environment today. MCPS loves to pat itself on the back and talk about how progressive and enlightened we are, and I will admit to that much, but challenges are mounting with an increasing ESOL population, truancy and behavioral change. As a result, schools are under pressure to keep their discipline rates low and their graduation numbers high. Administrators are almost begging teachers throughout the county to pass students, ignore their attendance issues and give them work so that they can graduate. This is not isolated to me or Blair HS. I know many teachers who say the same, but we are in no position to refuse such requests and are complicit in playing this dangerous game at the expense of students who leave high school unprepared for the real world. Am I straying from the things I love here in my last segment? Make no mistake about it, I loved teaching and coaching and everything else that I did at Blair over the past 30+ years, but there has to be something said about why a person who has a great job like mine also wants to retire. An honest perspective with reference to the good and the bad and to change is what I am offering here.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">So, here’s to the students who come to school and class on time. And to those who do the right thing even when no one is watching. And to the ones who use their cell phones responsibly. And to the ones who refrain from using offensive language in places where others they do not know can hear them. And to the ones who practice hallway etiquette and are mindful of where they are walking. And to those who practice common courtesy and say please and thank you when it’s appropriate. I celebrate this dying breed because there’s nothing in place anymore to hold students accountable, so those who do right by choice should be commended. It appears that we have become so progressive that we have forgotten how to treat each other.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32618"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I will leave you with this: I still cry when they play the Blair Alma Mater at graduation and I bleed Blair red and white.&nbsp;I wish we would get back to the values that led to the pride that I feel to have graduated from MBHS, but this will not happen until there is a fundamental change in policy and until student behavior is held to higher standards and expectations. We have to return to consequences, accountability and common courtesy and not use these terms as bad words. This is my parting wish and it’s not impossible because it was done in the past. Cell phone use, inappropriate language and offensive behavior cannot be tolerated at its present level and as soon as this is agreed upon and realized by the people who have the power to change it, policy can be instituted. I can guarantee that teacher morale and student pride would improve as a result. Insisting on these values in our students won’t fix everything, but at least it would be an effort in the right direction.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff who I have worked with over the years along with the roughly 9,500 students who I have taught and coached. The people are what I will miss the most and all have played a role in making my long stay at Blair memorable and wonderful.</span></p>	32616

33037	An Opinion	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Questions C and D on this year’s ballot have sparked vigorous debate in Montgomery County, as the looming census report and redistricting are amplifying concerns about fair representation on the county council.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If approved, these proposals would change the structure of the county council. Ballot Question D will eliminate at-large seats on the council, dividing the county into nine individual districts. Question C, which is backed by the council, will maintain the at-large representatives and expand the council to a total of 11 members by adding 2 district seats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Silver Chips Voter Guide on page </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A6 </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">includes more information about the ballot measures.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the heart of the proposals are two distinct concerns of underrepresentation. Councilmember Evan Glass’s proposal in Question C seeks to account for the county’s population growth to ensure that districts in Montgomery County are aligned in size with other nearby counties. “We've had a 50 percent increase in our population over the last 30 years, which warrants an expansion of our democracy and an increase in our representation,” Glass said in an interview with Silver Chips.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nine Districts for MoCo, the organization behind Question D, believes that the at-large representatives on the council have failed to consider the concerns of upcounty residents. “Their job is to give a countywide perspective of what's going on in the county. And they're not able to do that,” Kimblyn Persaud, chair of Nine Districts for MoCo, said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While Glass’s proposal would dilute the power of at-large representatives on the council—they would make up four of 11 total seats instead of four of nine—Nine Districts for MoCo said that this does not go far enough to check the power of at-large representatives.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Much of the ongoing discussion surrounds the value of the at-large seat. Proponents of Question D believe that the election is structured so that the at-large seats will never represent their interests and therefore favor their elimination.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is essential to understand that there have long been significant ideological divisions based on geography in Montgomery County. The at-large seat is a mechanism to bridge these divides and seek to address issues with a holistic view.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In a blog published in The Seventh State, former County Executive Ike Leggett explained the value of an at-large representative. “We have a mixed system—four at-large seats and five geographical district seats,” he wrote. “This mix helps ensure local representation, plus it builds in and strengthens an overall County perspective.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Glass, an at-large member, also recognizes his role in representing a countywide perspective. “Having a hybrid system as we do with districts and at-large… allows different council members to look at their local parochial issue, and others to look at it from a countywide issue,” he said. “That's the balance that we should strive for in government.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This would not be the first time that the county that the council’s structure has been changed. The current council format was adopted in 1990 after a 1986 ballot measure proposed the expansion of the council by two seats. At the time, each district had roughly 150,000 residents.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since then, Montgomery County’s population has grown significantly. Now, each district representative is responsible for over 210,000 constituents.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Critics of Glass’s proposal note each additional seat on the council would incur $550,000 of annual payroll and operative costs, an important concern for taxpayers as the county faces an economic downturn. Glass argues that while these figures may seem daunting, they are necessary. “We have to invest in our democracy,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Glass is right. We do need to continually support our democracy, and an investment in the county council is long overdue. </span>The timing may be unfortunate and the costs steep, but the opportunity to expand the council is fleeting.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Question D misses the mark. Rather than eliminating at-large seats, which provide an important countywide perspective, we should seek to improve the process of electing them in order to ensure that all members of the county feel that their vote matters.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is possible that both ballot measures will fail. In a piece about the county-level ballot measures, The Washington Post Editorial Board opined that neither proposal was preferable to the status quo. But it is this sentiment that is perhaps the most dangerous. There are real issues at play, and while neither proposal is ideal, they are at least attempting to improve a flawed system.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Voting no on both proposals must come with the understanding that these issues must be addressed in another form.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ranked-choice voting, where voters would rank at-large candidates by preference on their ballots, is one such alternative. Both Nine Districts for MoCo and Councilmember Glass expressed their support for its implementation in Montgomery County. Ranked-choice voting would reward candidates with broader, more diverse coalitions rather than candidates appealing to a smaller, more enthusiastic base.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Mark Lautman, Nine Districts for MoCo’s treasurer, said that ranked-choice voting for at-large candidates would address his concerns that a vocal group in one area of the county has disproportionate influence over the outcome of elections. “If the council would move towards ranked-choice, [Nine Districts for MoCo] would shut down the same day.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Glass supports ranked-choice voting as well, revealing that he is “the only member of the county council to go to Annapolis and testify in support of ranked-choice voting, I absolutely think that we should have ranked-choice voting.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Perhaps that would be a good place to start.</span></p>	33036
33076	Concerns about hospital safety may cause a spike in the percent of midwife-assisted home births	<p>Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital visits are bringing greater and greater inherent risks, leaving many pregnant women searching for alternative places to give birth. As a result, many midwives are seeing an increase in clients looking to give birth at home or in birthing centers. According to the National Institute of Health, in the US, only about one percent of babies are born at home, but some prenatal care workers and experts predict that COVID-19 encouraging women to deliver outside of the hospital might cause a spike in the percentage this year.</p><p>Dorothy Lee, a Takoma Park resident who works as a midwife at BirthCare &amp; Women's Health in Alexandria, VA, has seen an increase in clients coming to her practice who are already far along into their pregnancy. “We're not quite overrun, but there is a run of women who are looking for alternatives from the hospital,” Lee says. “The month of May is going to be very busy for us because I believe we took on about 10 new clients.”</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33075"></div><p>Even though many new clients are coming to her at the last minute, Lee believes many of them are not complete strangers to the idea of a home birth. Many of her pregnant clients have likely considered home birth but are now more serious about it as they wish to avoid the hospital.</p><p>“I think most of those women sort of contemplated doing a home birth at some point, but the social mores of this country… up until now, have been against home birth,” Lee says.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the fear Lee often sees around home births, due to mostly anecdotal complications, there is now greater reason than ever driving these women to her services. “Now with [COVID-19], all of a sudden women are like, ‘Oh, look at that. I thought about a home birth, maybe this is the time to do it,’” she says. “And so I think that’s the women that are coming to us,” Lee says.&nbsp;</p><p>Lee’s practice has not changed its guidelines on what constitutes a normal pregnancy that the midwives can safely deliver out-of-hospital, even though they have accepted more clients since the start of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>“We don't deliver twins at the birth center or at home. We don't deliver breeches. We don't deliver people with preeclampsia, which is high blood pressure that comes because of the pregnancy,” Lee says. “We haven't compromised who we keep because of COVID-19. If they say they don't want to go to a hospital, that's their choice, but they can't stay with us if they're not in our protocols of a normal healthy pregnancy.”</p><p>While some women are turning to midwives like Lee to find alternative places to give birth, most are still going to the hospital to deliver their babies. Some women must deliver at the hospital because they have a high-risk pregnancy or need a caesarean delivery. Many others simply feel safer at the hospital or want to have the choice of getting an epidural at the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p>Kelli Harkless, a midwife who usually helps with hospital births but is currently only seeing patients for checkups, understands why women fear delivering in the hospital, yet doesn’t think a home birth is the answer for every woman.&nbsp;</p><p>“Out-of-hospital birth always has to be a very personal decision for someone anyway, and I think it probably pertains even more so now,” Harkless says. “I don't think the coronavirus means that everybody should be having home birth because there are a large portion of people who want an epidural, [and] they don't want to be able to feel all their contractions.”</p><p>For women that do deliver in the hospital, there are special measures in place to keep them protected from the virus, especially if a woman in the labor and delivery ward has COVID-19. “Generally if there's a woman in labor and she has tested positive for the virus, she's going to be on the same unit as the rest of the moms who will also potentially be in labor,” says Harkless. “They just have special rooms for them that are supposed to control the airflow… so that the airflow in that room is not getting to the rest of the hallway.”</p><p>Lee and Harkless are also working to keep their clients safe from the virus in their offices, and in Lee’s case, in the clients’ homes. First and foremost, they keep their workspaces and instruments clean by constantly wiping everything down with disinfectant. “We use a lot of bleach on instruments, and the table, and the doorknobs,” Lee says.</p><p>However, Lee and her coworkers have run out of their supply of bleach wipes and can’t acquire more, so they had to get innovative. “We don't have bleach wipes because they're gone, so we do a lot of making our own bleach solution and spraying it on paper towels and wiping things down. We're now starting to run out of paper towels.”</p><p>Additionally, Lee and Harkless always wear masks when with clients and encourage the clients to wear masks as well. “Everyone has to have a mask on, and that's including patients,” Harkless says. “We have the cloth ones on hand that we can give to people if they show up without a mask.”</p><p>Overall, both Lee and Harkless have seen that many pregnant women are worried about how to safely bring a baby into the world during a worldwide pandemic, so they are doing everything they can to support their clients in having the safest possible pregnancy and delivery.&nbsp;</p>	33075

Thankfully, club captains and sophomores Jamie Rowley and Conrad Smith have a far more accurate explanation. "Angling is the professional name for fishing. It covers more of a lifestyle rather than the sport, and it's also the history," Rowley says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every week, members meet for lectures all about how to fish. "We go over safety, Maryland law, outdoor code, ethics and just how to be a safe and responsible fisher," Rowley says. "We want to make sure that they know as much as they can before they go out on the water."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At Blair, Rowley and Smith are the perfect pair to learn from.

"I watched a lot of YouTube," he says, chuckling.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The true highlights of Angler's Club are its fishing trips outside of school. They've been all over the region on past trips, including Northwest Branch, Anacostia River, Sligo Creek, Lake Needwood, Clopper Lake and the Chesapeake Bay. "We try to get people out in nature, get them off their phones and enjoy something that people take for granted," Smith says.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Angler's Club meets every Friday during lunch in room 216.

Senior and club founder Audrey Li has completed her replica of Italy's Duomo di Milano, the cathedral church of Milan.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Architecture Club generally consists of lectures and building projects. Li and fellow founder Karen Yang (senior) have a plentiful assortment of topics planned, starting with types of structures and the design process, then moving onto green buildings, disaster-proof architecture and 3D computer-aided design tools. "[Building and lecture time] depend on how long it takes to build, when it arrives, and if we have money for more," Li says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to these regular meetings, Li and Yang are also looking into a variety of competitions, including the </span><a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/design-competition/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Cooper Hewitt's National High School Design Competition</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><a href="https://www.artandwriting.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Scholastic Art Awards</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Cooper Hewitt's prompt for the 2019 competition sought designs that addressed a global nature-based problem.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Architecture Club also has big plans for the holiday season—gingerbread houses scheduled for Dec. 13! "Maybe we'll have a contest for aesthetics, too," Li says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Li explains that the club is of a more relaxed, learning-based nature. "It's not meant to be an intense environment," she says. "We want it to be a place for people to chill, learn some architecture, and make friends."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Li's favorite aspect of the club is its environment and member dynamic.

Players compete for various resources by rolling dice, or block each other's tracks by building their own.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ramirez was initially reluctant to start a gaming club because he feared it would be too broad. "There's so many different video games that there is really always too much strategy involved," he says. "However, with strategy gaming and tabletop gaming, there's tactics to the game and how to play it."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the gaming aspect is fun, Ramirez also notes the simultaneous learning that occurs.

32117	The singer announced in his Instagram comments that he was not actually scheduled to perform at Blair	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Silento will no longer be performing at the arts advocacy assembly hosted by High School Nation (HSN) at Blair on Thursday afternoon, Principal Renay Johnson announced in an </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3awq_VhC6h/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Instagram post</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> on Wednesday night. The line-up change and Silento's response has prompted students to question High School Nation's honesty in distributing information about the event.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The assembly, sponsored by Hollister, Takis and other companies, is advertised on High School Nation's </span><a href="http://www.highschoolnation.com/sponsors" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">website</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> as part of "a tour visiting schools across the country, introducing students to opportunities in music, arts and media." At each school they visit, HSN sets up a series of zones where students can meet professionals in the arts industry, get hands-on experience in music, dance and design, and watch multiple music performances, fine arts resource teacher Jacqueline Armstead-Thomas said in an </span><a href="http://bnconline.net/arts-advocacy-event/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">announcement</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> on Infoflow.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32116"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As part of the event, Blair is also supposed to receive new recording and production equipment from HSN. In emails, financial specialist Donna Franklin said Blair neither paid nor received payment for hosting the organization or receiving the equipment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair students first heard about the event during the week of Sep. 30. Initial information about the assembly, including social media </span><a href="https://twitter.com/blairprincipal/status/1181749956929036288" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">posts</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> by Johnson on Oct. 8, stated that Silento would be headlining the performance lineup.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, Johnson's most recent Instagram </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3awq_VhC6h/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">post</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> regarding the event informed students that the lineup has changed. "There is a small change to the artist lineup," she wrote. "Blair will now welcome singer and actress Kerri Medders as the new headliner." After receiving multiple frustrated comments from students, Johnson disabled the comments on her post.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers then took to Silento's Instagram account, posting comments asking him to come to Blair. Silento responded to Blair student Dave Kelil's comment saying he was never scheduled to come to Blair. "I never was scheduled to come… I'm overseas ending my tour [and] I'm coming back to America soon," he wrote. Silento also sent a direct message to Kelil, later posted by the Instagram account </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mbhs4/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">@mbhs4</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, in which he wrote "Man @highschoolnation keep telling lies."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Medders, </span>a 19-year-old singer and actor from Texas, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">replied to a comment on her account confirming that Silento was not scheduled to perform at Blair. "Silento hasn't even been on the tour since the first week. I'm very confused on why this is happening," she wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After receiving many requests from Blazers asking him to perform, Silento said he would fly back to the United States and try to set up his own pop-up concert in Silver Spring. He direct messaged Student Member of the Board Nate Tinbite and "I love u guys, I'm flying home to set up concert for Saturday. I won't let u guys down" [sic], before asking students to meet him at Ellsworth Mall. In an image on his Instagram story, he also announced that he sent a venue request to The Fillmore. No details about the potential pop-up have been confirmed yet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">High School Nation has faced scrutiny from multiple individuals since starting their arts advocacy tour. In an </span><a href="https://highschool.latimes.com/arcadia-high-school/opinion-high-school-nation-is-a-gilded-marketing-gimmick/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">article</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in the Los Angeles Times, Atussa Kian, a student at Arcadia High School, called the event a "gilded marketing scam," writing that the organization required students to follow the sponsors on social media to receive the free products they were giving away. "The activity, merch and snack stands, all sponsored, seemed like they were supposed to be the main event, while the music apparently took a backseat," Kian wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Administrators have not yet addressed the student backlash to the announced changes. Johnson posted a video of the HSN setting up for the event in the stadium on Thursday morning. "High School Nation is setting up now for our show! Get ready Blazers! So glad our school was chosen to host this FREE event!" she wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is a developing story and will be updated as more details emerge.&nbsp;</em></p>	32116
32612	Not all students who complete a senior research project (SRP) are in the Magnet Program	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Jan. 9, a hundred seniors gathered in Blair’s Student Activity Center to share their summer internship research to scientists, mathematicians, friends and family. Senior Research Project (SRP) is a tradition for Blair Magnet students to complete a STEM research internship over the summer between their junior and senior year. While SRP is usually synonymous with the STEM Magnet program, not all seniors who complete an SRP are in the Magnet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Magnet teacher Angelique Bosse runs the SRP A/B classes, which are theoretically open to all students who want to complete an SRP. “Blair High School also has a research program in place for students who are non-Magnet who can also do a similar research project process. I welcome kids if they come to me, but I do not actively recruit [non-magnet] students,” Bosse says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32611"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This year, two of the three non-Magnet students who took the SRP class were exposed to it through cross-country. Seniors Takeshita Sho and Max Worley are both on the cross-country team that Bosse coaches. “In SRP A, I learned to write a cover letter and a scientific research paper. In SRP B, I wrote a paper, made a presentation for younger Blair students and produced a poster to communicate my work orally and visually to scientists in the region,” Sho says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Besides being a tradition in the Magnet, completing the SRP also allows students who complete the entire process to get a seal on their high school diploma. For both Magnets and non-Magnets alike, landing a summer research internship is hard. “Professors already have college students who want internships, and high school programs are highly competitive. We always have a handful of people who just are unable to get an internship,” Bosse continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Because internships are competitive, non-Magnets may have a disadvantage while playing the application game. “I think I lacked the connections a lot of Magnet students seemed to have. I think for people outside of the Magnet, they need to understand that it is crucial to be looking for opportunities in the fall of their junior year,” Worley says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many seniors also tapped into their extracurriculars for connections. The third non-Magnet student, Senior Nate Kelkay, got his internship through his robotics mentors. “One of my five robotics mentors offered his lab out and to also engage with some of his robotics engineers,” Kelkay says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When it comes to the actual SRP project, Sho and Kelkay were able to work on exciting, ground-breaking research.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sho worked at Catholic University under the Chung lab on his project entitled “Keratin 19 Gene Co-expression Analysis.” Sho first wanted to do an SRP so that he could get a feel of what working in a lab is like. His bioinformatics project helped find genes and pathways related to breast cancer for further study.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“For my SRP, I narrowed down pathways and genes and tried to find if they have a known relationship to breast cancer or Keratin 19, which is believed to play a role in the progression of breast cancer,” Sho continues. Sho says that the hardest part of the internship was reading the background info on the lab he was working on.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The title of Kelkay’s research project is “Developing a Vision Enabled Autonomous Driving Capabilities For Competitive Robotics,” which he worked on in Intelligent Automation Inc. at the University of Maryland. “We were trying to develop a vision system on our robot and create a better system that handles things in our competition better. I worked a lot with code and debugging. This way, I focused on creating a product that our [robotics] team here [at Blair] can use,” Kelkay says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The community around non-Magnets taking SRP may feel disjointed. “I didn’t notice any stigma, but during the SRP ceremony, I felt out of place when they had slideshows of people in the Magnet and made the event appear as if it was exclusively for Magnets,” Sho concludes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kelkay agrees, stating that more outreach can be done to promote the SRP class, such as by advertising on InfoFlow. “Overall, I do like the idea of spreading it to other students, because the ones that come are the ones that are interested and have the motivation to complete the work,” Kelkay concludes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the end of the day, not all students who complete an SRP are in the Magnet. No matter what, each and every student who completes an SRP gains a comprehensive and innovative lab experience.</span></p>	32611
32868	Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) becomes one of the first school systems in the nation to approve of an LGBTQ+ studies course for its high school students.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">June's pride month elicits an explosion of flags and colors as members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies participate in parades, festivals, and other community events. These activities spread awareness and expresses celebration of identity in communities across the world, but Montgomery County's pride month this year celebrates another milestone: the passing of LGBTQ+ studies courses in high schools around the county.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On May 12, Montgomery County's Board of Education approved of the development of an LGBTQ+ social study elective for 11th and 12th graders across the county. The course will be piloted to 10 schools and offered starting from the second semester of the 2021 school year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Uma Fox from Richard Montgomery High School and her nonprofit </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mocopride/?hl=en" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">MoCo Pride</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> have advocated for LGBTQ+ representation in MCPS classes since the beginning of the 2020 school year. Currently, Fox stays involved by contributing to the curriculum for the class. "I founded [MoCo Pride] officially under MCPS in October and started recruiting people for applications. I think one of the number one things I kept hearing from students was that they wanted to see themselves represented in what they were learning in classes," she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fox states that the course curriculum will be modeled after traditional college-level LGBTQ+ studies classes, with topics including LGBTQ+ art interpretation, history, modern-day issues, general culture and advocacy opportunities. "[The course will] look at both pre-colonial history, US history over the decades and different case studies and LGBTQ+ experiences. These will occur with different literature and artistic pieces as supplements that can be analyzed," Fox explains. She emphasizes the idea that while the history of the LGBTQ+ community is a crucial part of the curriculum, the class delves into current events and each student's own identity.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32867"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Not only does she highlight how the members of the LGBTQ+ community will explore their identity, Fox encourages heterosexual and cisgender students to take the course to educate themselves and feel empathy for their peers. "The course is going to start with a greater understanding in more of a definitional aspect for students to learn what it is to be LGBTQ+ and self explore their own identity beyond sexuality and gender - who they are as a person," Fox says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the course garnered a positive response from many of the students in MCPS, opposition also revealed itself in hate comments and posts on social media. Blair junior Francesco Berrett describes that the backlash the course received stirred a strong response in the LGBTQ+ community, "It's frustrating to see change and then the response of a lot of people being 'it's being pushed down our throats.' A lot of us have faced very hateful and bigoted people within and out of the school system," Berrett says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To Fox, opposition for the course only demonstrates the necessity for these students to develop an understanding of LGBTQ+ experiences, identity, and general information. "The amount of hatred [the course] got on social media is less of a concern - it's more of a reflection of how much we need this course and how much progress there still is to make. I think it's a reminder of how much it needs to be incorporated into our education," she continues.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair sophomore Lilian Palosky also expresses the exigency for a course that informs students of the LGBTQ+ community. "[We need] an in-depth discussion on the LGBTQ+ community and what the more common </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/style/lgbtq-gender-language.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">letters</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> are, because I know that a ton of people are under-informed about a lot of them," they say. Overall, they believe that the passing of the studies course will raise awareness about the LGBTQ+ community.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to assisting students in developing an understanding of their identity and the identities of those in the LGBTQ+ community, Fox adds that there is more to a person's identity than their sexual orientation and gender. "It's a course where you need to think [with] intersectionality: being LGBTQ+ is never a person or a history's full story. We need to consider how race, gender, socioeconomics, and ability can all influence sexuality and LGBTQ+ experiences." Fox and a group of around 15 students and adults are continuing to develop the curriculum to incorporate every aspect of the community.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the teachers and schools piloting the class have not yet been released, Fox adds that these teachers can influence the syllabus in future years as well, as most have first-hand experience with the LGBTQ+ community or are well versed in its history. The curriculum's flexibility allows teachers to include personal anecdotes and ideas in the course.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As MCPS's new social studies class continues to develop a comprehensive image of the LGBTQ+ community, Fox expresses her excitement towards the result of her advocacy. "I'm delighted - it's been phenomenal to see people's interest. I'm so excited to see the culminating work of students finally be a reality and see a group of students really make LGBTQ+ history."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32867
32615	How the social media app has mesmerized over a billion people around the world	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Do you get a good laugh from point-of-views (POVs), a genre of comedy video where the performer and the viewer each play a role, or do you like cute couple videos? Or maybe you’re busy learning a new viral dance. Whatever you prefer, it is likely that you have been sucked into the world of TikTok and you’re not alone. The video-sharing social media service has Gen Z hooked, with nearly 1.5 billion total users worldwide. In the U.S., </span><a href="https://mediakix.com/blog/top-tik-tok-statistics-demographics/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">60 percent</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of the app’s monthly active users are 16- to 24-year-olds and it is one of the most popular apps among young people.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32614"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The app formerly known as Musical.ly before being rebranded as TikTok in August of 2018 is owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance. It has received heat from technology professionals who warn of the app’s suspicious data collection. Branches of the U.S. Military have banned the use of the social media platform on government-owned phones and have advised that people take precautions to safeguard their personal information. Officials have casted doubts on the security of the Chinese-owned company, concerned about the possibility of spying by the Chinese government. Yet amid this scrutiny, the app’s exponential growth has not halted.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">TikTok’s triumph can be attributed to its genius concept and design. The app features a highly addictive “For You” page that allows the user to scroll through a never-ending stream of content. With a seemingly infinite stream of short, digestible videos, it is no surprise that users often get tantalized by the app for hours at a time.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One of the main attractions to TikTok is the possibility of fame. The algorithm used for the “For You” page allows posts to be viewed by people all over the world. The way the app promotes videos allows nearly anyone to gain thousands of views on a post, no matter their previous popularity.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair junior Noelle Efantis experienced this random bout of luck with one of her posts. With 485 followers, she is hardly TikTok famous. But when she posted </span><a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/XPY9JM/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">a video of herself</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> shaping her hair into different letters to the song “Love” by Nat King Cole at three in the morning, she got a taste of fame. “It got 200,000 views and 21,000 likes,” she says. “I woke up one morning and everyone was like ‘You’re famous.’”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Efantis explains that the reason she and many other people her age love TikTok so much is because of the accessibility to light-hearted, entertaining content. “There is a lot of funny content on it and it is basically a place where you can go and laugh and see funny people from different areas of the world,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The exploding success of TikTok among young people is in large part due to their need to be endlessly entertained. TikTok provides that entertainment and gives a home to people looking to fool around. Efantis’ advice to fellow TikTok users: “Don’t put a lot of effort into it because I don’t think that you should put a lot of effort into TikTok, that’s one of the brilliant things about it.”</span></p>	32614
32115	An increasing number of bus law violations prompted this decision	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For the 2019-2020 school year, the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD), in agreement with security supplier Force Multiplier Solutions, installed cameras on all 1,400 school buses to ensure pedestrian safety.

32916	For many stuck inside due to quarantine, baking bread has become a popular pastime with a variety of recipes to try at home.	<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=sourdough%20bread&amp;geo=US" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to Google Trends</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, searches for “sourdough bread” have sharply increased over the past 12 months. The graph shows a large spike from March 1 to March 20, but this data does not come as a surprise to many. With much more time on their hands many people have begun to experiment with new hobbies and activities they hadn’t previously been able to do: one of which is baking bread.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From sourdough to muffins, there are endless possibilities of different breads, doughs and bread related foods one could make. Some of these recipes require lots of care with constant kneading and resting over a long period of time, and some are easier and can be completed in an hour.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32915"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Boredom and extra time isn’t the only reason there has been an influx in breadmaking during the COVID-19 pandemic. A global pandemic combined with economic problems and the loss of many jobs causes a lot of stress and anxiety. </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2020/report" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to a study conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA)</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, the average stress levels on a scale from 1-10 for American adults is a 5.4 compared to the previous year with an average stress level of 4.9 This is the most significant spike in stress levels the APA has seen since they began conducting this survey. People are looking for a way to comfort themselves and calm their anxiety. Baking, and eating homemade baked goods can be comforting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Philip Muskin, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University spoke with </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/12/baking-anxiety-millennials/578404/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">The Atlantic</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to explain how baking can help to relieve stress. “Baking is mindful. Mindfulness means paying attention to yourself in the moment and not being in the past or the future, but really being there,”&nbsp;Muskin explains. The process of combining a few simple ingredients, kneading the bread and finally baking it can be soothing. The achievement of a finished loaf can make one feel accomplished as well.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As many people take up this new hobby, key ingredients such as yeast and flour are flying off the shelves. According to the Guardian, “yeast shortages have been reported in supermarkets across the UK and the US, with yeast suppliers calling the current demand ‘unprecedented’.” Though these ingredients are running low, people are finding creative solutions to such problems. Google has also seen a spike in no yeast bread recipes. Additionally, as flour flies off the shelves, some bakeries have begun to package up their own flour to sell, or create baking kits. These kits have ingredients already correctly portioned out for the buyer to bake their own loaf from their favorite bakery.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even those with no experience can succeed in making bread; here are some basics to help you get started: The basis of sourdough, one of the most popular types of bread is the starter. Sourdough starter is a mixture of flour and water that ferments. At home, bakers can use this starter for more than just bread, it can be added to pancakes or waffles for a more tangy flavor. If sourdough recipes are too complicated, a two ingredient dough has recently grown more popular across the internet. A mixture of self-raising flour and greek yogurt creates a simple and healthier multi-purpose dough. This can be used for bagels and&nbsp;pizza dough, just to name a few.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is no surprise there has been a spike in at home bread baking with the start of quarantine. With recipes and methods for all levels and resources, baking bread is a great new hobby to pursue for anybody who has some extra time. Nothing is more comforting than the smell of fresh baked bread in your home.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Here are a few recipes to try out:</span></p><p><a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Sourdough Starter</a></p><p><a href="https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2014/01/sourdough-bread-a-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">A Beginner's Guide to Sourdough</a></p><p><a href="https://www.recipegirl.com/2-ingredient-bagels/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Two Ingredient Bagels</a></p><p><a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/the-easiest-loaf-of-bread-youll-ever-bake-recipe" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">“The Easiest Loaf You’ll Ever Bake”</a></p><p><br></p>	32915
32136	An overview of community reactions and what the future holds for the facility	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sept. 8, the Silver Spring community celebrated the grand opening of the newly renovated Wheaton Library. The facility, a combination of a library and recreation center, is the first of its kind in Montgomery County and the surrounding community couldn’t be happier.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fully fitted with a basketball court, game room, second-floor walking track, exercise room, book store and study rooms, the Wheaton library and recreational center has something for people of all ages.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32135"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is important to note that the two halves of the center—recreation and library—are managed by different groups. The recreation center is managed by </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/rec/facilities/recreationcenters/wheaton.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery County Recreation</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, while the library falls under Montgomery County Public Libraries. “The idea is to figure out how we can work together to create a facility that will work for all of our customers,” library branch manager Dianne Whitaker states.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whitaker joined the project in 2011 when the planning committee first decided that the county and community could use a combined recreation and literary center. She has overseen the development of the new building from the initial design to what it looks like today.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Addressing the community's needs was a priority while the facility was under development. “When we were planning this, we looked at the needs of the community: we looked at the need for classroom space and the need for meeting place,” Whitaker says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From the modern yellow and orange exterior to the large, airy interior, the new community center stands tall and strong at the corner of Arcola and Georgia Avenue in Silver Spring. “What we ended up getting was a very light and bright building, but it's also getting a huge response from the community with a lot of use,” Whitaker says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The library's opening brought the community together in astounding numbers and continues to attract people to its amenities. “Opening day was fabulous. We had between two and three thousand people enter the building within three hours on our first day, and every day since every study room has been booked by both teens and adults,” Whitaker describes. Turnout has been so good that the library has barely been able to keep up with the requests for library cards.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“The energy from the staff has been very good, very positive. The librarians are pretty engaged and continually making an effort to serve the community,” Whitaker continues. With the powerful response from the community, there’s always someone to help find a good book or assist with work.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The center hopes to become even more integral to the community students by offering service opportunities. “We want to increase the support we have for younger students by engaging teens in volunteer activities such as homework clubs,” Whitaker explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the whole, the center looks to offer programs—art class, coding clubs for middle school students and film classes— to further fill its numerous activity rooms. The possibilities for the center to continue developing are endless thanks to the fully-equipped, modern space.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For now, it is a haven for many students after school. “As soon as kids are done playing, they come into the library and begin studying. People can spend a good part of their after school time here,” Whitaker says, looking out her office window to the students flowing in and out of the library doors.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The new Wheaton Library and Recreation Center is filled with fun and educational opportunities for everyone, and is the perfect place to work, read or spend time after school.&nbsp;</span></p>	32135
32833	The show is a touching and comedic milestone for South Asian representation	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As people all over the country stay home and try to entertain themselves during the COVID-19 pandemic, several Netflix original shows have made the headlines, from "Tiger King" to "Money Heist." But none of them have been as unique and emotional as Mindy Kaling’s&nbsp;"Never Have I Ever," starring 18-year-old Canadian newcomer Maitreyi Ramakrishnan. The series follows Devi Vishwakumar, a high-schooler in the San Fernando Valley as she navigates school pressure, family problems and crushes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As Devi struggles to untangle her feelings after her father's sudden death, which took place a year before the show’s timeline, she is also faced with a host of other common teenage issues — feeling disconnected from her Indian culture, trying to get the attention of popular jock Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet) and competing with her academic rival Ben Gross (Jaren Lewison).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Meanwhile, her friends and family navigate their own worries. Robotics enthusiast Fabiola Torres (Lee Rodriguez) worries about how to come out to her family; eccentric theater kid Eleanor Wong (Ramona Young) misses her mom, who left her family to pursue acting; Ben wonders why his parents are more invested in their careers than in raising him and Devi's cousin Kamala (Richa Moorjani) juggles a secret relationship with prospects of an arranged marriage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Until now, South Asians haven't gotten much in the way of media representation — most shows or movies that feature Indian or Indian-American characters reinforce unfortunate stereotypes of socially-awkward nerds or clueless immigrants. "Never Have I Ever" stands out, especially to me and other Indian-American teens who have waited for our multifaceted identities to be mirrored in mainstream pop culture. Devi is a well-written, three-dimensional character whose identity goes beyond an obsession with academics or an inability to socialize with boys. Sure, she does an appalling number of extracurriculars and is expected to get into Princeton, but she also goes to parties and doesn't hesitate to stand up for herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32832"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"Never Have I Ever" is especially notable for how it addresses topics like whitewashing. Although Devi is initially unlikable for her unwillingness to embrace her heritage, her struggle is one that is often relatable, especially for first-generation individuals who simultaneously don't feel Indian enough or American enough. Fortunately, the fourth episode, titled "Never Have I Ever felt super Indian," features guest characters who remind Devi of the importance of staying connected to her background.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In each of the 10 episodes, the series breaks barriers in multiple areas. Devi's frequent therapy sessions, which are smoothly integrated into the plot, normalize maintaining positive mental health. The portrayal of Devi's mother Nalini (Poorna Jagannathan), a successful dermatologist, breaks the stereotype that women must choose between a career or family. Kamala's eventual decision to get to know the husband her family finds for her dispels misconceptions that arranged marriages are always forced and uncomfortable. In the fourth episode, the directors share several nuances of Indian culture, from vibrant portrayals of Ganesh Puja, a Hindu festival, to explanations of the many different religions in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Refreshingly, "Never Have I Ever" also joins the increasing ranks of works that are positive about teen relationships and sexuality, portraying Devi and her friends' curiosity as normal and handling it without (too much) awkwardness. Occasional jokes — like the quip, "Aunties are older Indian women who have no blood relationship to you, but are allowed to have opinions about your life and all your shortcoming" — keep the audience laughing while simultaneously making the show thought-provoking and relatable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As with any teen sitcom, there are some downfalls in the show's writing. The biggest one is the fact that tennis champion John McEnroe narrates Devi's thoughts, although he doesn't have much of a connection to the series besides a couple ultra-scripted appearances. Additionally, although the last episode is emotional, the conclusion seems rushed. Devi's redemption arc from her initially argumentative, cutting personality is hastily shoved into a quick concluding scene, leaving viewers wanting more. While the choice makes sense for a show that is looking to be renewed, it doesn't do Devi's character development justice.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, as far as its discussion of serious topics coupled with subtle humor, the show is a winner. The plot may not be incredibly mind-blowing, nor are the directors' choices groundbreaking, but "Never Have I Ever" is a milestone for South Asian representation on the big screen. Its combination of convincing acting, a catchy soundtrack and relevant subject matter provide one-of-a-kind entertainment and high hopes for a second season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	32832
33179	Maceda Berhanu, SGA president, sets out her plans for the 2020-21 school year.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWhen a student returns to school after being suspended, they may face a number of challenges. They may have missed several classes and fallen behind. They may face humiliation. And they may not have the structures and support they need to reintegrate effectively.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33177"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maceda Berhanu has made changing this problem one of her priorities as the SGA president. In her time on the SGA, she has headed a number of efforts aimed at improving the overall well-being of Blair students, specifically those returning from suspensions.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHer main project last year revolved around restorative justice––an approach to punishment that shifts the focus away from retribution and empowers offenders to reckon with their actions through community-building exercises.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLast year, Berhanu helped implement a restorative justice committee composed of her and two other students which works to help students returning from suspensions. “[We need to] focus on how we can remove barriers to relationship-building and establish alternatives to shame while highlighting the effects of suspension,” Berhanu said. The group’s main project involved surveying Blair students who were skipping class. They would walk through the halls and talk to students in the halls, asking them questions and gathering data. After that, their hope was to go back and mentor and help the students, and to use the data to inform decisions moving forward.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBerhanu and other members on the committee had several other ideas for how to help students returning from suspensions, including implementing restorative justice circles. “When students are gone for a long period of time [and they return], they're missing a bunch of work, [they don’t really know] what's going on,” she said. “A ‘welcome back’ circle [would] kind of reassure them.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBerhanu also had an idea to help suspended students get back on track by assigning them a staff member who would assist them in a number of ways. “When you [come] back, you would be assigned to a trusted adult, who's designated to… watch over you and assist you throughout the school day.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThroughout last year, Berhanu made a point of trying to curb students’ workload and prioritize their mental health, including one radical idea: “Our plan was that students would have one weekend a month of no homework,” she said. Unfortunately, COVID-19 thwarted those plans. “Everything got really cut short because of [COVID-19].”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHowever, Berhanu is still pushing initiatives aimed at helping students through virtual learning. “We have a hotline that's open right now where students are able to text a number that is totally anonymous,” she said. “They can send any concerns that they may have about virtual learning.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn the same vein, Berhanu said she has been helping students deal with teachers who make them turn their cameras on during Zoom classes. “Something that we really want to address is cameras,” she said. “Although teachers aren't allowed to force [students to turn them on], we've heard that a lot of teachers are.” Concerns like these have been brought to Principal Renay Johnson, who Berhanu said has been handling the situation well by communicating with teachers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn the coming weeks, Berhanu and the SGA are planning to unveil a new Blair podcast. “I'm very excited about the podcast releasing,” she said, “not only because it's something new, but it [gives] students a whole new opportunity to voice their opinion about various issues.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tA new Blair app will also be arriving sometime this school year, offering students a centralized place where they can access information about clubs, athletics, and other general updates about Blair events. The app will also include other features, such as letting students know if any given day is odd or even.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;“Our main goal is to create community engagement, and I think it's going to be a big part of [what] the Blair SGA will have to offer this year,” Berhanu said in reference to the app. “[It’s] something that I hope everyone is looking forward to.”</span></p>	33177
32572	In high school teams, transgender athletes should not be an issue	<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">In recent years, transgender women athletes have gained both positive and negative recognition towards their accomplishments.

In Montgomery County, if there is documentation that an athlete identifies as whichever gender, that is the team that they are allowed to play on,” Boule says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair was one of the first MCPS schools to start embracing transgender athletes on school teams, far before Maryland made a concrete law concerning transgender athletes in 2016. “Blair is great.

Some may dress in the nurse’s office of an open bathroom,” Boule notes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The state-wide plan also requires accommodations in all public high schools so that transgender athletes feel comfortable before, during and after the game.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Another addition to the MCPS </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/students/rights/1243%2019_GenderIdentityGuidelinesForStudents_WithCOVER.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1fDG_RUh714abpNNPSDoWBF2nItAeuH44JkMT6PcpPw9pj6Db1_RJ99IY" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">guidelines </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">is a “plan” where the student discusses with a trusted adult point of contact about “preferred athletics, extracurricular activities, etc.” While the guidelines may have good intentions, the whole implication that transgender students need a “plan” can be alienating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The implication of creating a specific plan down to the best extracurriculars is alienating. It almost implies that transgender athletes need to have things specifically prepared for them, perpetuating the stereotype that they are “different.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is ridiculous that at the high school level, there are arguments </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/13/justice-for-trans-athletes-is-unfair-to-girls-like-my-daughter/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">against </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">trans women competing on women's sports teams. The Olympics and professional sports may be a different story (as the stakes are higher), but the main point of a high school sports team is not about winning or losing. The point is to teach life-long skills such as empathy, inclusion and confidence.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore trans swimmer Lilian Palosky believes that all this backlash is absurd, “A lot of people tend to think that trans women transitioned specifically to be better at athletics and that's just not how that works. The lengths to which you would need to go to fake transition for something like that is unrealistic,” Palosky says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">High school is the prime time to find oneself, and such controversy can hinder students from freely expressing themselves and being confident in their own bodies. “It is extremely depressing to be told that because your sex is male, you have to compete as a man. That is terrible for mental health. If you're going to have a system that cares so much about gender you have to accept non-cis people for the way they identify rather than purely based on birth sex,” Palosky continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the end of the day, a high school sports game is just that: a game. A win or a loss should not be the determinant of a team’s success; rather, it should be the energy and atmosphere that the team radiates.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“[Transgender athletes] fall right into the team culture and enjoy it. They’ve had a great experience, and the coaches are also great. At the end of the day, they are not treated any differently,” Boule says. At the high school level, the key is not “fairness” or record-keeping, it is a sense of teamwork and self-worth that ultimately shapes each and every person.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32571
31956	Four Blair track runners competed in the distance medley relay	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On June 16, Leoluca Cannuscio ('19), Brian Hufford ('19), Ryan Temple ('20) and Joel Simpson ('21) ran for Blair at the New Balance Outdoor Nationals at North Carolina A&amp;T University in Greensboro, N.C.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cannuscio, Hufford, Temple and Simpson ran the Emerging Elite Distance Medley Relay. Cannuscio ran the 1600 meter leg, Simpson ran the 1200 meter leg, Hufford ran the 800 meter leg and Temple ran the 400 meter leg. They finished in 10th place out of the 28 medley teams with a time of 10:35.75.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31955"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout the season, the four runners each earned the qualifying time for their respective leg of the relay, after which they became eligible to compete at nationals.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Qualifying track runners came from high schools all around the country to compete at this event. "Thousands of athletes competed from all over the United States as well as Puerto Rico," Simpson said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The runners were proud of their result. "I was happy with our result and we had a good race — 10th out of 28 was a good result for us, especially at a national level," Temple said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Simpson said that Blair's success at the 2019 county track and field championships gave them more motivation to perform well at nationals. "The experience was different compared to the regular season. We had a lot of momentum coming off the season — we won the Montgomery County 4x800 Championship and got third place at the state meet. I think it brought the team together more," Simpson said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the Montgomery County track championship e</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">arlier in the season</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Sam Rose Davidoff, Cannuscio, Hufford and Simpson won the 4x800 relay. Nate Kinyanjui, Enoch Agbodjogbe, Hufford and Temple earned second place in the 4x400 relay. At regionals, the 4x800 team earned fourth place, qualifying them for states where they earned third place. The 4x400 relay team got fifth place at regionals, just missing out on a spot in the state championship, as only the top four teams from regionals qualify for states.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This was Cannuscio and Hufford's final high school meet. Cannuscio will continue his athletic career at Loyola Marymount University, while Hufford will also run at Salisbury University. They both earned partial scholarships to compete at the collegiate level.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Temple and Simpson are excited to have more success at the national level in the next outdoor track season. "We used the national meet to get experience and we hope to actually compete there and try to make moves on the national scale next year," Simpson said.</span></p>	31955
33010	With the new Apple update comes customization and more freedom for an iPhone layout	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Scrolling through your phone is a routine thing for most high school students - most, if not all, spend at least two hours on their phone daily, from texting to using social media. However, getting to different applications requires browsing through the home screen, which is where Apple's latest update comes in with their most popular feature: widgets.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sept. 16, 2020, Apple released iOS 14, their newest operating system, and along with it came new customizable features and more security measures. These features included adjustable volume for separate AirPod buds, app libraries and </span><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-14-compact-interface/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">compacted phone calls</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Among all these features, the most popular among young iPhone users is the widget feature.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33006"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Simplifying customization and organization for Apple users, widgets offer space for a creative layout on iPhones. Sophomore Anna Uehlein has implemented widgets in her home screen layout to improve the aesthetic and style of her phone. "I like the widgets because I think they're really cute - they make your phone look really nice," Uehlein says. "I'm able to use the app called Widgetsmith, where I can make a calendar widget and make it different colors."&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33007"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Widgetsmith, although not a part of iOS 14, is a new app that functions on iOS 14 where users can design unique widgets to replace app icons. This app allows for a wide range of creativity, offering various colors, templates and photos. It also provides far more flexibility with customizing widgets than the update itself.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33008"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Widgets have further proved to be immensely helpful to the iPhone-using community by giving users a way to organize their applications. Widgets provide a variety of icons that give users easy access to calendars, reminders, notes and photos. Another perk of widgets are stacks, which allow users to scroll through a certain widget.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33009"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although widgets have maintained the spotlight, the update included a range of useful elements. For one, users may pin chats, allowing for easier access to a conversation. Another notable element are the new group chat icons: think profile pictures but for group chats. Junior Cooper Dalbey enjoys this feature and explains that it is helpful to him. "[It's] easier for me to tell who's in the group chat," Dalbey says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With all these new features, it’s no wonder Apple's update has become increasingly popular among high schoolers. On TikTok, a popular social media app among teenagers, the update brought on a new trend where TikTok influencers showed off their layout. However, the popularity brings up a question: why weren't these widgets popular before? Believe or not, </span><a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/when-did-android-get-widgets" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">in 2008</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Samsung launched widgets as part of their system, but the customization feature never took off as well as it did when Apple introduced it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Amina King explains that this is normal as Apple is a well-known company, especially among the younger generations. "A lot of other electronic companies and phone companies come up with these ideas before Apple, and they [Apple] kind of adapt it," King says. "Then people see it as an Apple feature when it was already a feature [for other companies]."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As exciting as this Apple update proves to be, many of us are still looking forward to more features, including but not limited to: favoriting emojis instead of the inaccurately-algorithmed frequently used, marking texts unread as similar to emails, muting a FaceTime call on the receiving end and adding a wider variety of emojis with more color options. As Apple and other tech giants move forward, many are excited to see the new ideas and implementation of cool features and useful adaptations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To learn more, read about Apple's new update </span><a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-14/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">here</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. </span></p>	33006
31624	SCO's take on popular baking shows	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Baking shows seem to be the perfect mix of high-energy fun and mindless amusement to satisfy everyone's desire for entertainment. And for those whose forays into baking end with burnt pans or inedible cookies, what better way to satisfy a dessert craving than to curl up with a store-bought treat and watch a couple episodes of a baking competition? Here is SCO's review of four popular baking shows based on the following categories: structure, general atmosphere, judges and hosts, and of course, the baking products.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Great British Baking Show </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">(GBBS) (</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">also known as </em><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><em>The Great British Bake Off</em></strong><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">)</em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This ever-growing show, inspired by both American bake-offs and baking competitions in English villages, was first aired by the BBC in August 2010. Since then, it has amassed nine seasons, been picked up by multiple streaming services and grown in popularity all over the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46846771" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">world</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Structure: 4/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every episode has three rounds where bakers have to create original desserts and copy a product presented to them. This is easy to follow, but the fact that there are no eliminations along the way makes it hard for viewers to keep track of the large number of contestants. The backstories and home footage of each of the contestants, sprinkled throughout each episode, makes for a fun change. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">General atmosphere: 5/5 </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Contestants' demeanors when things don't go according to plan are refreshingly calm, and their joking exchanges and friendly hugs add to the lighthearted atmosphere. The diversity of the bakers' experiences and backgrounds creates an interesting mix of personalities and recipes and brings a smile to viewers' faces. The setting, a tent in the English countryside surrounded by flocks of adorable goats, is homely and charming. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Judges and hosts: 5/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc constantly crack cheesy but enjoyable jokes. They are perfectly complemented by judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, who are quiet but encouraging and take time to personally offer advice to each baker. All four's personalities make for a pleasant atmosphere. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Products: 3/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The restrictive categories in GBBS don't allow for much creativity and create overlap in flavors and presentation. That being said, it is interesting to see how each baker incorporates their personal experiences into their product. From a Spanish-inspired orange Swiss roll to mini cakes with flavors from India, many of the recipes on the show are reflective of an array of exciting cultures. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31623"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Zumbo's Just Desserts</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This Netflix original series featuring Australian dessert-makers began in summer 2016. It has an endearing resemblance to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because of its eccentric and passionate contestants and unique, out-of-this-world desserts. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Structure: 4/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Each episode begins with a freestyle round for all the contestants. The two weakest performers then face off in a "Zumbo Test" to recreate one of judge Adriano Zumbo's legendary desserts. Although the progression of the rounds is unique, the lack of ranking of all the contestants creates ambiguity for viewers who may struggle to keep track of them. The clips featuring the backstories of each contestant seem to mimic GBBS a bit too much. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">General atmosphere: 3/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Zumbo's Just Desserts is centered around the clock. With crying, frantic running and frequent breakdowns from contestants, the high-stakes competition in the show easily stresses viewers out. Almost every line uttered during the show is clearly scripted, creating a cringeworthy experience for viewers. However, the rainbow-striped carpet, Edison light bulbs and other colorful and quirky accessories redeem the show and bring back some cheer. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Judges and hosts: 3/5 </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Head judge Adriano Zumbo definitely creates tension with his high expectations. Co-judge Rachel Khoo, on the other hand, looks uninterested but offers up equally harsh criticism. Timekeeper Gigi Falanga's role seems pointless —&nbsp;she periodically yells obnoxiously and offers unsolicited advice to the clearly annoyed contestants. However, the judges redeem themselves by expressing sympathy and advice&nbsp;whenever a contestant seems especially frazzled.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Products: 5/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The lack of restrictions in the first round brings forth a variety of jaw-dropping creations from the contestants, from traditional desserts like apple pie to stranger concoctions like froot loop ice cream. Despite its emphasis on recreation instead of originality, even the Zumbo Test round features desserts that viewers can't help but marvel at, like a four-layer mirror glaze cake. </span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nailed It!</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This Netflix original that premiered in March 2018 is inspired by the internet phenomenon where ordinary people attempt to recreate professional cakes. The show, which currently has two seasons plus a third holiday season, features amateur bakers who are provided with recipes and enthusiastically take on giant challenges.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Structure: 3/5 </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The first round of each episode, where each contestant chooses a small dessert to recreate, is called the Baker's Choice. This is followed by a round called Nail it or Fail it, where bakers are required to recreate a complex cake in just two hours. While the structure is simple to follow and the small number of contestants prevents confusion, the lack of elimination along the way kills any competition or suspense that might have occurred. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">General atmosphere: 2/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Because the bakers featured in this show are inexperienced, they often struggle to stay calm under pressure and often suffer nervous breakdowns, making the show stressful for viewers. The contestants are likable because of their average skills that resonate with viewers, but their constant annoyance at one another drags down the mood of the show, as does the remarkably average and non-colorful setting. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Judges and hosts: 2/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Host Nicole Byer is over-animated and too enthusiastic to be likable, and her frequent jokes fall flat. Judge Jacques Torres is the exact opposite — he is subdued and seems uninterested in what the bakers have to offer, causing the audience to lose interest too. The occasional guest judge is well-balanced and keeps positivity alive in the studio, but Byer and Torres' extreme personalities are a downfall. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Products: 4/5 </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though the quality of the products the bakers make isn't great, they still deserve a high score simply because of the entertainment they provide. The contrast between the complex originals presented to them and the laughable recreations they make is hilarious and keeps viewers engaged. </span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sugar Rush</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This show, also a Netflix original, was released in summer 2018. Only one season currently exists.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Structure: 2/5 </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Several factors make each episode's progression difficult to follow —&nbsp;contestants get three hours for the first two rounds and individually decide how to portion that time, elimination occurs after all contestants have already begun the second round, and some teams receive extra time while others don't. It almost seems as though creators of "Sugar Rush" tried to add in too many factors that muddle the structure.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">General atmosphere: 2/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The emphasis on time limits is evident through the contestants' constant worried mentions of the clock and frequent breakdowns. This, combined with the heightened animosity between contestants, creates an awkward atmosphere for those watching. The ultra-industrial feel of the studio, created by large metal appliances and plain workstations, somehow adds more stress for viewers. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Judges and hosts: 1/5 </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Host Hunter March makes an effort to appear enthusiastic, but his half-hearted participation clearly shows that he isn't excited to be involved. The same goes for judges Candace Nelson and Adriano Zumbo —&nbsp;both seem to have a preference for the other baking shows they have judged, creating an overall lackluster feel.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Products: 5/5</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What this show lacks in other areas, it makes up for in desserts themselves. Since the contestants are highly experienced, there's no end to the unique things they bake. From wasabi cupcakes to a five-tier galaxy cake, the treats on Sugar Rush definitely don't fail to impress. </span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Based on each show's overall scores out of 20, here is a ranking from worst to best. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">4. Sugar Rush (10/20)</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">3. Nailed It!

32005	Red flag laws, universal background checks, bans on assault weapons and large magazines are necessary to decrease gun violence	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As of Aug. 18, the United States </span><a href="https://www.massshootingtracker.org/data" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">has seen 319 mass shootings</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">— incidents where four or more people are shot at the same place and time— in 2019, and average of 1.38 per day.

That's a total of 1,611 victims of U.S. mass shootings this year alone.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To prevent these shootings, the U.S. needs to take action by implementing mandatory universal background checks, assault weapon and large magazine bans. In addition, red flag laws— laws that allow law enforcement to remove guns from people who pose a threat—and prohibitions against owning firearms for individuals with domestic violence records are necessary to prevent guns from getting into dangerous hands.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32004"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Legislators who do not support gun control legislation often blame mass shootings on </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/04/el-paso-dayton-mass-shootings-kevin-mccarthy-says-video-games-partly-blame/1915061001/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">video games and mental illnesses</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, believing that they encourage violent tendencies. In doing so, they are losing track of the real goal: to pass gun control legislation. However, the root cause of these shootings stem from the lack of gun control legislation nationwide.

32675	The proposed changes aim to prevent selective enforcement and increase equity.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In mid-January, the Montgomery County Council proposed amendments to an existing law that requires residents to register their bicycles with the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD).

The amendments would make bicycle registration voluntary rather than mandatory, as well as repeal two other sections of the law that allow police to confiscate unregistered bicycles and direct sales funds from impounded bicycles toward injured or retired officers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The proposed changes came after local Constitutional rights activist and Silver Spring resident Steve Silverman was stopped in June 2019 for running a stop sign while on his bicycle. In addition issuing a citation for the stop sign incident, MCPD officers Christopher Brown and Jason Haiko cited Silverman for not having an official registration sticker on his bicycle.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32674"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">﻿After Silverman filmed and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28w6xvRj9EM&amp;feature=emb_logo" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">posted</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> the incident on his Youtube channel, it was covered by </span><a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/montgomery-county-council-introduces-bill-that-would-repeal-mandatory-bicycle-registration" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Fox 5</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, </span><a href="https://reason.com/2019/12/17/this-bicycle-registration-law-gives-police-yet-another-excuse-to-punish-insufficiently-meek-citizens/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Reason Magazine</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> and several other outlets.

Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando (D-At Large), a co-sponsor of the proposed bill, was one of several elected officials who disagreed with the implementation of the law and its selective enforcement. "We don't think that it's good practice or a good law to have the police to have that type of authority," Jawando said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The law also led to confusion among residents due to its previous lack of enforcement. Blair senior Daniel Cook, whose bike is his primary mode of transportation, did not know about the law until recently. "In theory, I think it's good that the idea of registering exists. It's good to have it voluntarily done if you want to," Cook said. "But I don't agree with the idea that the law should be mandatory — I just don't understand it."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although the county has long required residents to register their bicycles of the county code, Jawando estimated that by 2019, only 436 people out of the county's 1.1 million had their bicycles registered. Councilmember Evan Glass (D-At Large), another co-sponsor of the bill, explained that despite the law, "most people do not know that they have to register their bicycle."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The co-sponsors of the bill also hope the changes will help combat environmental issues by increasing access to alternative types of transportation.

"We can lower the barrier for access. By removing the registration enforcement, we will no longer penalize people who want to ride their bike."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The public hearing on the bill took place on Tuesday, Feb. 11 at 1:30 p.m., with Silverman and others testifying about their experiences. It will soon go before the joint Transportation and Environment and Public Safety committees before the Council votes on its passage. "I don't imagine any problem passing this because when we introduced it, many of the council members either co-sponsored or said that they thought it was a good idea," Jawando said. If passed, the bill will likely go into effect by spring 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	32674

Before they even get to that point, they must sit for an array of standardized tests—SAT, PSAT/NMSQT, SAT subject tests, Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) exams—with the goal of proving their readiness for higher education and creating competitive college applications. Behind a large majority of these tests is College Board, an American not-for-profit organization formed in 1899 with the intention of expanding access to higher education. But with absurdly high exam fees and hidden costs, College Board fails to achieve this goal.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">College Board has a monopoly on the standardized testing industry through registered trademarks for SAT, AP and PSAT/NMSQT. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The SAT is the most widely taken college admissions test, with more than </span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/10/31/sat-scores-rise-as-number-of-test-takers.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">two million test-takers</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> in the class of 2018.

32921	Masks have become an integral part of life in the U.S. - will it stay that way after COVID-19 is gone?	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, masks have become a big part of our daily lives. For most of us, picking up our mask on our way out the door has become second nature: you can’t go out without it. Once the pandemic is over, however, will masks still stick around?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">First, let’s take a look at mask culture from before COVID-19. “Face mask culture” originated in 1918 when the Spanish flu broke out and it was discovered that masks were an effective preventative measure against the deadly virus.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the time, World War I was in full swing and wearing face masks was a patriotic duty to protect troops. </span><a href="https://www.history.com/news/1918-spanish-flu-mask-wearing-resistance" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to history.com,</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> the American Red Cross issued PSAs about the importance of masks, with messages like “the man or woman or child who will not wear a mask now is a dangerous slacker.” Most people diligently wore their face masks everywhere they went.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even after the Spanish flu was over, face mask culture remained prevalent in Asia. Masks became a common part of life and were used for a variety of reasons: blocking pollution, minimizing the effect of allergens, and for privacy. Masks were very common during seasonal disease periods too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While face mask culture was already adapted in the East, masks are a pretty new part of life for the West. In the U.S., masks went away after the Spanish flu and have only recently resurfaced during COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While polls from </span><a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Ipsos</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> show that most Americans are willing to wear masks properly in public, there is a lot of controversy over whether masks should be mandated by companies and businesses. Some Americans consider requiring masks to be an infringement on their rights, while others argue that it is one of the only ways to make workplaces safe during the pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What makes mask culture in the U.S. so much more controversial than in other countries? Perhaps it is that our country was founded on the partisan protection of rights, or that we continue to receive </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/25/face-masks-america-divided/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">mixed messages</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> about mask requirements from our leaders.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There is also a difference in American values and the values of Asian countries who have embraced masks more easily. While the American mindset focuses on independence, most Asian countries value more of a group mindset and collective nationalism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the other hand, since American values are more centered around being an individual instead of part of a mass group, it’s harder for U.S. citizens to differentiate between doing something for themselves versus doing something for the public.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This individualism tends to lead to more questioning of the government as well. It’s easier for people who view themselves as individuals to disregard what higher powers tell them - unlike in most Asian countries, where government orders are followed without objection.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Likewise, there is also a difference between our current values and our values during the Spanish flu. Back then, Americans held a deep sense of patriotism, and were willing to put their own individual values aside for the war effort. Now, however, it’s the other way around - many Americans choose to put their own beliefs ahead of the nation’s needs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Thus, in America we now see a divide between those who are willing to wear masks for public safety, and those who hold tight to their own individual beliefs instead. Masks have subsequently become highly politicized and stigmatized in the U.S.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This then leads to the question of what face mask culture in the U.S. will look like once the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Masks fizzled away in the U.S. after the Spanish flu, but remained prevalent in Asian countries. Will this happen with the U.S. after COVID-19, or will face masks once again fade away?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to </span><a href="https://www.kansascitymag.com/will-america-become-a-mask-culture-heres-what-a-bioethics-expert-had-to-say/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">an interview with bioethics professor Jessica Berg</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, it’s unlikely that masks will become a part of American culture in the same way it is in Asia. Berg thinks the politicization of masks will make it hard for them to integrate to American culture. “I think there’s still a genuine question about how hard it’s going to be for us, culturally, to accept masks now as not either stigmatizing or even problematic,” Berg says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Still, Berg says it is possible masks will become less stigmatized if enough people continue to wear masks regularly for seasonal disease periods. This takes away from the political aspect of masks and makes it a commonplace act of politeness and respect, regardless of whether they are being mandated or not.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whether or not this cultural shift will happen at the end of the pandemic, we all have to do our best to stop the spread of COVID-19. Right now, wearing a mask should be a matter of care and respect for those around us, and we need to put public health before our personal values just as we did back in 1918.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Masks need to be destigmatized and treated as a valuable and necessary measure in defeating COVID-19, and it’s a responsibility that we all need to take for the sake of our future. </span></p>	32812
31910	Eilish's debut studio album is a wonderful ride through the singer-songwriter's psyche	<p><br></p><p>On March 29, LA-based singer Billie Eilish released her highly anticipated album “WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?” In her studio debut, Eilish tackles themes of drug usage, heartbreak and loss.</p><p>“WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP” isn't a major departure from Eilish’s previous works. Her notorious monotone to high-pitched singing style is still front and center. The vocals on most of the tracks are layered with reverb, conveying an ethereal feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>The production differs greatly from track to track, and takes ideas from a range of influences including electropop and indie. The album features a great tonal shift with the songs. Towards the front half of the project are the more fast-paced such as the playful track bad guy and you should see me in a crown. The songs towards the latter half are more slow and somber such as the track ilomilo and i love u.</p><p>The album’s biggest weakness lies in Eilish's vocal range. She employs her usual falsetto through every song on the album. While it can be effective, as she demonstrated on the closing songs on the album,the lack of diversity in her singing style eventually becomes limiting. She over-stretches her singing in some songs, particularly the track when the party's over.</p><p>Despite its flaws, smart lyrics combined with infectious beats and beautiful singing make "WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP" a satisfying pop album. With the release of a project like this, it's hard not to be excited for Eilish's upcoming work.</p><p>Favorite Tracks:<em> bad guy, ilomilo, you should see me in a crown, bury a friend</em></p><p>Least Favorite Tracks: <em>when the party's over</em></p>	\N

It takes multiple days to make bread from start to finish; to be exact, sourdough bread requires 76 hours of preparation time before 40 minutes of cooking time. Freshman Lucia Santoro-Vélez enjoys baking, but she has never been able to make bread because of the time it demands. “Because of corona, I’ve been able to spend more time on more labor intensive baking projects,” Santoro-Vélez says. She recommends the following recipe.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32826"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sourdough Bread Ingredients:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">3-1/2 cups whole wheat flour</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">2 1/2 pounds water</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">2 1/4 pounds organic all purpose flour</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1 tablespoon unrefined sea salt</span></li></ul><p><a href="https://thepioneerwoman.com/food-and-friends/how-to-make-artisan-sourdough-bread/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">See the full recipe here.</a></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cheesecake</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Anika Dasgupta loves all things food and is actively posting her quarantine creations on her food Instagram account (</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/a.hungry.foodie/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">@a.hungry.foodie</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">). Cheesecake is one of her favorites. “It is really silky and is best topped with fresh fruit,” Dasgupta says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32822"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cheesecake Ingredients:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">2 packages (8 oz. each) Philadelphia cream cheese, softened</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;1/2 cup sugar</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;1/2 teaspoon vanilla</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;2 eggs</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;1 ready-to-use graham cracker crumb crust (6 oz.)</span></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.myfoodandfamily.com/recipe/051208/philadelphia-3-step-cheesecake" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">See the full recipe here.</a></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Dalgona Coffee</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The dalgona coffee trend began on TikTok in early March, when the hashtag #DalgonaCoffee accumulated more than 10 million views. Photos and videos of the easy-to-make recipe quickly popped up all over Facebook, Instagram and Twitter as well. While at home, Dasgupta decided to jump on the bandwagon. “Armed with a spoon and a metal bowl, I whipped a mixture of coffee, sugar, and water for the better part of an hour,” she says. For those who love coffee but aren’t willing to spend an hour to make it, electronic mixers and whisks are simple substitutes.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32823"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Dalgona Ingredients:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Instant coffee</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Sugar</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Boiling water</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Milk</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Ice</span></li></ul><p><a href="https://jessicainthekitchen.com/how-to-make-whipped-coffee-dalgona-coffee-tips/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">See the full recipe here.</a></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Pancakes</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Pancakes are an essential comfort food that people are cooking in isolation. Scrolling through TikTok, you may have noticed one crazy new take on pancakes: </span><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/pancake-cereal-tiktok-videos-47436461" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">pancake cereal</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. The mesmerizing videos feature the creation of bite-sized pancakes that are an interesting replacement to cereal. If that’s too much to think about, the recipe for the classic, full-sized pancakes is below.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32824"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Pancakes Ingredients:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">2 cups all-purpose flour</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1/4 cup granulated sugar</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1 teaspoon baking powder</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1/2 teaspoon baking soda</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1/4 teaspoon salt</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">2 eggs</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">2 cups buttermilk</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1/2 cup salted butter, melted and cooled slightly</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Clarified butter or high-heat vegetable oil, for cooking</span></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Buttermilk-Pancake-Recipe-26947698" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">See the full recipe here.</a></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Baguettes</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Bringing it back to bread, senior Jennifer Ren endorses the following baguette recipe because it is easy to follow. Like Santoro-Vélez, Ren is using the extra time she has in quarantine to complete this time-consuming task. “My friend got me a baguette pan for my birthday last year and I never got a chance to use it... Making bread takes so long so I usually don’t have the time, but now that we’re in quarantine it’s a different story,” Ren says. Baking bread seems to be quite the accomplishment, so take the time you have now to follow the recipe below.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32825"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Baguette Ingredients:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1/2 cup cool water</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1 9/16 teaspoon active dry yeast or instant yeast</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">4 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">1 cup + 2 tablespoons lukewarm water</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">2 teaspoons salt</span></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2017/06/01/classic-baguettes-bakealong" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">See the full recipe here.</a></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If these recipes don’t interest you, look up the recipes for your own favorite foods.

31620	El Niño and polar vortex will cause heavy winter storms in MCPS this year	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) is expecting a lot of snow coming late January and early February due to special weather conditions that will combine cold air from a polar vortex with precipitation from El Niño.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">El Niño is an irregularly occurring series of climate-related events that cause the Pacific Ocean to be warmer and more nutrient-poor. This leads to high amounts of water vapor in the air and more precipitation. Catherine Trouteaud, an AP Environmental Science teacher at Blair, has taught about El Niño in her science class. "El Niño is one of the reasons why we have had such a rainy fall and now into the winter. The funny thing is that we don't know that El Niño is happening until October," Trouteaud said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31619"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to </span><a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/weather/potential-for-polar-vortex-on-the-horizon-heres-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Fox 5</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, the polar vortex is the cold air that sits over the Atlantic. The piece of the vortex has broken off and is now traveling southward. This cold air will mix with the precipitation brought on by El Niño to create snowy weather. "This area will get these artic cold bursts from the vortex plus the El Niño, so the conditions are right for a high snowfall," Trouteaud said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Alex Tsironis, the creator of </span><a href="https://www.mocosnow.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">MoCo Snow</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a local hub for winter weather information, took a summer class at Montgomery College about meteorology. "I learned the basics of the weather in that class, so when it was time for me to start figuring out a few weather things myself, I used that along with looking at weather models and googling things," Tsironis said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To make his predictions, Tsironis compiles information from various weather forecasts with his background knowledge to predict how the weather might affect school delays and closures. So far, he has miscalculated very few times. "I have been wrong about six times in 10 years," Tsironis said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MoCo Snow has corroborated that El Niño and the polar vortex will bring a lot of snow. "Based on almost every prediction, it's supposed to be a very cold and stormy time for us," Tsironis said. Unfortunately, weather predictions are no guarantee, and it is possible that the blizzards could miss Montgomery County completely and veer in another direction.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As for what Blazers think, senior Maxine Surla is excited about the upcoming weather and what it could mean for school closures. "It is nice to know that in my senior year there will hopefully be a whole bunch of snow days," Surla said.</span></p>	31619
32815	Recent events led to conflict among progressives, the Democratic Party and more	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"The greatest obstacle to real social change has everything to do with the power of the corporate and political establishment to limit our vision of what is possible and what we are entitled to as human beings," said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) on April 8. The statement, a reference to Nelson Mandela's famous quote, "It always seems impossible until it is done," was part of Sanders' address announcing he was suspending his campaign for 2020 Democratic nominee for President.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sanders' platform aimed to fight against that "corporate and political establishment," which he and his supporters often referenced. It embodied the desires of progressive America, largely composed of young people who crave concrete change on social justice issues, environmental policy and more.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32814"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of them is Blair junior Dana Graham, who will be voting for the first time in 2020. Graham decided to support Sanders because of his leftist views. "In the end, we need somebody further left, because he pulls the country as a whole left, and I think that's like a good thing that we really need to see in politics," Graham explains. "We need this kind of like revolutionary change that we haven't seen in ages and ages." Now, as former Vice President Joe Biden definitively takes the stage as the Democratic candidate, many of those young people have been left conflicted.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Biden has been especially singled out in this election cycle for his departure from "revolutionary change" and progressive </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/22/joe-biden-new-deal-democrat-republicans" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">politics</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. During his Senate campaign days, he was hailed for advocating for welfare expansion and taxing millionaires. However, by the 1980s, he resorted to a centrist approach that he still maintains today, which has brought backlash. "I was a little bit disappointed in the Democratic Party, because if you look at Biden's like stance on a lot of the issues that Sanders was basing his campaign on, he's pretty much just like a Republican, in a way," senior Jennifer Ren expresses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Self-proclaimed progressives have been vocal against the "vote blue no matter who" mantra that many Democrats have adopted, saying it comes from a place of privilege and overlooks the damage that Biden has done on issues from healthcare and civil rights to foreign policy.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sexual assault allegations against Biden further complicate the "vote blue" narrative for many voters. In early April, Tara Reade, a former Senate aide for Biden, accused him of harassing her in 1993. Several other women have also stepped forward to accuse Biden of inappropriate conduct, and an investigation on Reade's allegations is ongoing. Despite a lack of official confirmation or denial, the situation has disheartened many teens who see Biden's nomination as a sign of establishment voters' disregard for supporting assault victims. "No words can describe the excruciating pain of knowing that our next president will be another man who has at least sexually harassed women," senior Ruby Farber says, referring to the </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-sexual-assault-allegations-all-list-misconduct-karen-johnson-how-many-a9149216.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">20-plus</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> sexual misconduct allegations against President Donald Trump.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Diversity has been yet another point of contention in this election cycle. "[We started with] 23 candidates and we ended up with a 77-year-old moderate without a strong platform," senior Adia Keene says, expressing her frustration that such an unparalleled and diverse field of contenders was narrowed down so quickly. Graham echoes the sentiment. "We started with the most diverse primary ever, and it was so cool to see six or seven women running and people of color running. And then you were left with an old white establishment Democrat," she says. "Are women and people of color ever going to get the same kind of recognition and standards? Is it ever going to be as easy for them to hold high office as it is for white men?"</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the election draws closer, alliances have become more and more blurred. Although Sanders endorsed Biden after dropping out, key figures in the Sanders campaign have not backed the endorsement. Briahna Joy Gray, Sanders' spokeswoman, is one such figure. "I supported Bernie Sanders because he backed ideas like #MedicareForAll, cancelling ALL student debt, &amp; a wealth tax. Biden supports none of those," Gray </span><a href="https://twitter.com/briebriejoy/status/1249775161689214976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1249775161689214976&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fcampaign%2F492564-sanders-campaign-spokeswoman-i-dont-endorse-joe-biden" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">writes</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> on Twitter. Young people across the nation who backed Sanders, namely college groups, have also refused to endorse Biden.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers are similarly conflicted. "I think it was inevitable, but I wish [Sanders] hadn't endorsed Biden or at least had been more critical," senior Gabe Winston-Bailey says. Some, like Ren, plan to vote for Biden in the general election, but say they will do it reluctantly. "I'm still going to vote for Biden because anyone's better than Trump, but you'd best believe I won’t be happy about it," she explains. Others are holding out and supporting Sanders for as long as they can. While Graham plans to vote for Biden in the general election, she says her conscience is telling her to vote for Sanders in the primary.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A mid-2019 </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/2020-election-voter-turnout-could-be-record-breaking/591607/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">piece</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in The Atlantic predicts that voter turnout for the 2020 presidential general election will be higher than ever before, in part because of an increase in youth who are eligible to cast their ballots. As young voters look toward November, the prospects are bittersweet, but many are holding onto hope that the events of the election cycle have transformed American politics. "People have been saying that this election is going to be a referendum on Donald Trump, on nationalism, on more right-leaning policies, and I want America as a whole to say no to that," Graham says. "I hope that this primary has pushed even the Democratic Party as a whole further left." </span></p>	32814
31960	The latest Marvel film is a shaky kickoff to a new era	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Following explosive Marvel films like </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Avengers: Infinity War </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">(2018) and </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Avengers: Endgame </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">(2019), audiences needed a Spider-Man sequel that could capture the fun character of Spider-Man while respecting the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)'s continuous storyline. The two forerunners played important roles in the MCU, as they saw the retirement of beloved heroes such as Iron-Man and Captain America. With these figureheads out of the picture, Marvel had their work cut out to get audiences to accept the future of the MCU, starting with </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Spider-Man: Far From Home</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31959"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film follows high schooler Peter Parker (Tom Holland), or Spider-Man, who is struggling to meet expectations of becoming the next Iron Man. Wanting to adopt a regular life and escape the stress of being Spider-Man, Peter joins his school's trip across Europe and takes a shot at a normal high school relationship. When destructive creatures begin to appear wherever his school goes, Peter reluctantly answers the call to action from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the man who brought together heroes like the Avengers and new hero Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). But as he soon finds out, looks can be deceiving.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Far From Home</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is a creative and light-hearted movie that throws in as many jokes as the script can hold. The movie’s purpose is to cheer up audiences and fill the void left by the exit of heroes who dominated Marvel titles for the last decade. The change from the catastrophes in </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Infinity War </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">and </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Endgame</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to the humor and lightheartedness in </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Far From Home </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">is abrupt and disorienting, especially since Iron-Man was Peter’s mentor and father-figure.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The plot starts off slow but gradually picks up the pace throughout the movie. It soon becomes clear that the Peter we see is the opposite of the boy eager to dive into heroism from </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. In </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Far From Home</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Holland brilliantly captures a character who is torn between leading a normal life and saving the world as Spider-Man.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though individual performances of characters are well-cast and realistic, their interactions are the true weakness of the film. In </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Homecoming</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, we were introduced to a quirky Mary Jane "MJ" Watson (Zendaya). </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Far From Home </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">tries to further develop MJ as Peter’s love interest, but falls short through awkward dialogue that results in an underdeveloped relationship between the two.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The movie also attempts to portray Mysterio as an inspirational figure for Peter, but with minimal interaction between the two, it is unrealistic how their relationship evolved in such a short amount of time. The one exception to this trend is Peter’s best friend, Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), whose satirical wisdom provides a calm break from the forced character interactions.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film’s strong suit is its cinematography and visual effects. </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Far From Home</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> exhibits stunning and realistic settings with destructive creatures seemingly rising beneath the characters’ feet. A few scenes in the movie show supernatural battlegrounds reminiscent of those from </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Doctor Strange</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (2016). Aside from damage and destruction provided by effects, director Jon Watts also captures the unique ambiance of European cities, from the narrow and busy canals of Venice to the bright and colorful Signal Festival in Prague.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite its shortcomings, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Far From Home </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">as a standalone is a fun movie that maintains the youthful and humorous characteristics of Spider-Man. With mesmerizing and creative cinematography along with setups for future conflicts, it will be interesting to see how Marvel looks to move on further after </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Endgame.</em></p>	31959
32439	Nabiha Atique is one of the few exchange students in Montgomery County this year	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It's lunchtime on a Wednesday. Freshman Nabiha Atique walks into room 263, where Blair's Amnesty International club is meeting. After participating in an icebreaker, she heads downstairs to the arts wing, where she works on a vase for ceramics class. Later that afternoon, she goes to a poetry rehearsal for Sankofa, Blair's annual show celebrating Black History Month. Atique's busy schedule is similar to that of many other Blazers, but there is one difference — she is an exchange student from Karachi, Pakistan who is only at Blair for one year.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Atique, who is staying with senior Cecelia Bauer and her family in Takoma Park, Md.,&nbsp;is in the United States on a scholarship from </span><a href="https://www.afsusa.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">AFS Intercultural Programs</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, an exchange agency that organizes study abroad programs around the globe. Although she received the scholarship within a few weeks of applying, her exchange location came as a surprise. "My family was really trying to get me in and told me that I should apply for the scholarship," she says. "I got my placement [in Takoma Park] just a week before I came here."&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32438"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On her second day in the country, Atique recounts, she wanted to go to CVS, but misinterpreted the Google Maps results on her phone, walking 30 minutes to the store in Silver Spring rather than to the one five minutes away from her hosts' house. But despite humorous mishaps, she has quickly adjusted to American life. "Takoma Park is so beautiful," she exclaims. Atique's home city had more than 14 million people and plenty of "buildings, buses, trucks and cars everywhere," so she finds her new home peaceful.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although many may consider America to be a diverse "melting pot," Atique, surprisingly, sees it as homogeneous when compared to Pakistan. "You see really diverse culture in Pakistan —&nbsp;some places are really colorful, and other places are more businesslike, and so on," she explains. "I really like the culture in America, but it's more of what you would expect."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In Pakistan, Atique was on a pre-engineering track at her 500-student school. Her course load included computer science, physics and chemistry. But since coming here and observing the country's press freedom, she has discovered a love for journalism and activism. "I love the first amendment. Because in Pakistan, even though freedom of the press is there, you can't publish or speak out about anything wrong with someone else's religion," she says. Atique hopes to take her new passions back home with her, and wants to learn how to open a school for disadvantaged children in Pakistan. "The main problem I see in my country is that there's not enough free education, and that causes so much illiteracy. People don't really know the difference between right and wrong anymore, so I want to fix that," she explains.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32437"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After moving halfway across the world, Atique can no longer spend time at arcades with her friends like she did in Karachi, and has a newfound love for D.C.'s go-go music. But most of her interests have not changed — One Direction songs, John Green books and Netflix are still favorites. Although she misses her family and nine cats, the exciting new experiences and familiar hobbies make up for any homesickness, she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Atique is enjoying her year in the U.S., but getting permission to come here was no easy feat. In June 2019, due to overcrowding, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) limited the number of exchange students that could come into the county through AFS, Youth for Understanding USA and ASSE International Student Exchange Programs. Initially, only Magruder, Damascus, Gaithersburg, Rockville, Seneca Valley, Sherwood, Springbrook and Watkins Mill High Schools were available for exchange students.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The exchange policy caused significant backlash, including by Susan Baker, Bauer's mom and Atique's host parent. "They seem to think that foreign exchange students are just there to take spots away from someone else," Baker says, citing the county's failure to post their revised decision on their website despite multiple requests. "They weren't following a clear policy and they weren't transparent about the policy."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In a series of emails to MCPS Chief Academic Officer Maria Navarro, Baker reported that Wheaton High School and Bethesda Chevy-Chase High School, two schools closed off to exchange students, were less crowded than some of the eight open schools. Referencing the higher-than-average Free and Reduced Meals rate in the DCC, she also wrote, "DCC students — with fewer resources to travel, study or volunteer abroad on their own — would benefit even more from a chance to engage with exchange students in their home schools."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In hopes of creating change, Baker, Bauer and other members of the Blazer community attended a Board of Education meeting on June 24. Senior Hemakshi Gordy testified at the meeting, sharing her positive interactions with Blair's exchange students. "Exchange students teach us to communicate across cultures, a life skill that we all need to navigate today’s increasingly interconnected world," Gordy said. "Rejecting a handful of exchange students who bring so many benefits to our communities is not the way to solve [overcrowding]."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32436"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although they have yet to release their official guidelines for vetting exchange students, MCPS has since relaxed its policies, allowing Atique to attend Blair as planned. Although they are still frustrated with the county's lack of transparency, Bauer and Baker are looking to the future and enjoying their time with Atique. Since arriving in the country, Atique has traveled to Minnesota, Colorado and Tennessee to visit Bauer's family. Over the holidays, they plan to spend time with Baker's family in Arkansas. "I also really want to take her to New Orleans because it's one of my favorite cities," Bauer says. "I'm working on convincing her to go during spring break."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Traveling or otherwise, Atique and her host family have valued the exchange experience thus far. "Exchange students go out there to educate people about the world and do all sorts of things that are really positive for our students," Baker asserts. Bauer agrees, saying that living with Nabiha has helped her learn a lot about herself and "what [she] takes for granted." Atique expresses a similar sentiment. "Doing an exchange is a super nice thing because you're not only going places and not only meeting new people," she explains. "You are also exploring yourself."</span></p><p><br></p>	32436
33082	As Maryland confronts steep, unprecedented economic contraction, lawmakers outline what’s next	<p>In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers across the globe have shuttered themselves in their homes, making only occasional public appearances to shop for groceries or go for a socially distanced jog. Once-bustling city streets and storefronts are hauntingly empty. Unemployment levels have skyrocketed with unprecedented speed and magnitude. Hundreds of thousands of beloved small businesses have shut their doors, some temporarily in accordance with government orders, but many for good.</p><p>These realities have laid the foundation for an economic contraction rivaling the Great Depression of the 1930s. “This is like a category five mammoth hurricane coming in off the ocean and hitting the land, and on top of it, all of the sudden, there's a huge tornado that develops,” Maryland Comptroller Peter Franchot tells Silver Chips. “This thing we’re in right now is historically bad and catastrophic.”</p><p>Maryland’s economy, along with the national economy, is in dire financial straits precipitated by the pandemic. On April 10, Franchot and the Maryland Bureau of Revenue Estimates Director Andrew Schaufele announced a projected revenue loss of $2.8 billion for the state, indicating a total loss of nearly 15% to the annual general fund––and that’s just for this fiscal year, which ends&nbsp;on June 30.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33081"></div><p>Much of the revenue shortfall stems from a collapse of proceeds from sales tax, ballooning unemployment numbers and general decreased consumer spending, all of which have put many small businesses at immediate risk. “We have 175,000 small businesses here in Maryland,” Franchot explains. “Tens of thousands of them have already gone bankrupt and will never open again.”&nbsp;</p><p>Franchot, who lives in Takoma Park, was also the Comptroller of Maryland in 2008 when the Great Recession plundered the economy. But 2008, he explains, was merely a stiff wind compared to now. “That was a very painful period, but that [was] like a picnic compared to what will happen in the next month.”&nbsp;</p><p>The road to recovery will be long and painful, but Franchot highlights one potential benefit that could emerge. “The only silver lining to this horrible disease is that we get to reinvent the state of Maryland,” he says. “We’re talking about reinventing the state budget, frankly.”</p><h3><strong>Keeping the lights on</strong></h3><p>Whether it’s small business owners seeking access to federal and state relief funding, or unemployed individuals struggling to make ends meet for end of month payments, Franchot emphasizes that the people in immediate financial crisis need the most assistance. “The people I believe are most threatened are on the outside looking in,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>How exactly that assistance manifests depends on the situation. For example, people who are fortunate enough to have a financial cushion to fall back on should be grateful and generous, but still careful.&nbsp;</p><p>“To anyone who is getting a salary and is not threatened right now: first of all, count your blessings; second of all, be just as vigilant about your financial issues as someone who doesn’t have the money to pay today’s rent,” he says. “If you do have the ability to spend $1,200, pick out 12 stores and buy a gift card.” Giving struggling businesses the money now will help them weather the storm down the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Justin Kaplan-Markley, one of the morning managers at Takoma Beverage Company, stresses that community support has been vital in outlasting the crisis so far. On a normal day, the cafe is hopping with teleworkers, coffee-drinkers, and local patrons from breakfast through dinner, but public health directives currently prohibit any in-person dining. In light of dine-in business being closed, heightened carry-out traffic has helped keep money flowing into Takoma Beverage Company and neighboring businesses in the area. “I know a lot of the small businesses in the Old Town Takoma area and everyone is very grateful,” Kaplan-Markley says. “Let’s keep supporting each other and local businesses.”</p><p>Destitute owners and individuals can assist themselves, too. One notion that Franchot has lobbied for in the past weeks is that the taxpayer is the best advocate for themself. “You should do what rich people do, which is continue to communicate, advocate, and negotiate,” he says. “Get on the phone with your landlord and say, ‘I don’t want to pay my rent for the next three months.’”</p><p>The idea that Franchot is advancing is called asking for forbearance, which he has helped push legislatively as well. In late March, as the tax collector of the state, he enacted a 90-day tax holiday for small businesses which allows owners extra time––until July 15–– to scrape together money to pay the bills. “The aim is to keep billions of dollars in people’s reserves,” he explains.&nbsp;</p><p>This sort of financial vigilance will prolong the ability of currently insolvent businesses and individuals to stay afloat and, quite literally, keep the lights on.</p><h3><strong>More than a ‘Rainy Day’</strong></h3><p>Another way that the state is hoping to protect threatened businesses and individuals is by funneling&nbsp;them federal and state relief funds.</p><p>On April 27, the Federal Reserve Board announced an expansion of the scope of the Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF), which was first established in early April. The MLF is part of a federal initiative to provide loan support to U.S. households, businesses, communities, and state and local governments.&nbsp;</p><p>Lorig Charkoudian, a District 20 Delegate for the Maryland House of Delegates, explains that the MLF can reduce cash flow strains at the state and local levels, including in Maryland. “It's a way to borrow and to fill some of these gaps at an interest rate that is almost zero,” she explains. “It’s kind of the way that the federal reserve has previously bailed out Wall Street and now essentially does some bailing out of state governments.”</p><p>Trillions of additional federal relief dollars have also been approved, including more than $650 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which offers loans to help small businesses stay afloat and keep as many workers as possible employed.</p><p>The distribution of these federal relief funds has incited a firestorm of controversy, however, as many truly small businesses have been unable to tap into the money stream while scores of large public companies, including Shake Shack and Potbelly, received millions.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everyone that has sophisticated financial advisers got taken to the front of the line,” Franchot explains, which has left businesses with a small infrastructure and few employees out of the picture. The PPP also experienced problems, including glitches and delays, when launching their program online. Generally, Franchot says, it's better to advocate for yourself than wait for help from what he considers the less reliable federal programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Maryland also has an emergency relief fund that currently holds $1.2 billion called the “Rainy Day” fund. There’s been back-and-forth over how much of the fund the state should use to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Franchot believes all $1.2 billion should be allocated.</p><p>“It’s far more than just a rainy day,” he says. “It’s a stormy day, and it’s exactly what the fund was set up to do.” According to Franchot, a sliver of the fund should be used to patch the most essential items that will undergo budget cuts, but the overwhelming majority should be directed to small businesses and helping revitalize the economy.</p><h3><strong>Reinventing the budget</strong></h3><p>Maryland is currently seen nationally as a very liberal state when it comes to the state budget and spending, Franchot says. But the stark economic downturn presents what Franchot recognizes as an opportunity to tighten up the budget and reposition the fiscal habits of the state. “Down the road, we need to shift gears and reinvent ourselves as a state that's fiscally moderate, welcomes small businesses, appreciates education, but is not interested in spending more taxpayer dollars on each and every initiative just because it sounds good,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Maryland legislators and decision-makers around the country are now faced with the necessity of restructuring budgets and pivoting on agendas in order to ride out revenue shortfalls. Charkoudian hopes that the Board of Public Works––a fiscal legislative body composed of Franchot, the state treasurer, and the governor––will look at all options before moving directly to cuts in the short-term. “We have to balance our budget, but I don’t think the first step ought to be to look for budget cuts.” she says. “We need a situation where the state is investing in the recovery.”</p><p>Evidently, reconsidering the budget is political and may not proceed smoothly, but leaders alike are forced with repairing the damage, and Franchot, for one, is hopeful about coming away from this catastrophe as a state with a reimagined national image.&nbsp;</p><p>Conceiving a new image, he notes, may mean slashing massive amounts of state funding and programs. After announcing a budget and hiring freeze in early April, Gov. Larry Hogan highlighted the unlikelihood of any bills requiring increased funding being passed. This includes the more than 679 bills the Maryland General Assembly deliberated on for over two months before the reality of COVID-19 led to an early adjournment. The torrent of gubernatorial vetoes began in earnest last week when Hogan elected not to sign several bills, including a highly anticipated public education reform spending package called the Kirwan bill.</p><p>The Great Depression was the last time the United States suffered an economic cataclysm of this magnitude. Around 25 percent of Americans lost their jobs, and President Franklin D. Roosevelt was forced to revitalize the economy from the ground up. In devising a framework to effectively rebound from the fiscal impacts of COVID-19, Franchot says he is looking to Roosevelt. “He tried hundreds of things, and he threw them all up against the wall… some of them worked, some of them didn’t work,” he says. “That's what we're going to have to do.”</p>	33081

32655	An inside look at how MCPS has changed over the past couple of decades	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), like any student body, is constantly changing as new students cycle in and old students cycle out. On the other hand, the teachers have, for the most part, remained the same. No one has a better look into how the county has changed than MCPS alumni who later became MCPS teachers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair social studies teacher Alison Russell graduated Richard Montgomery (RM) High School in Rockville in 2007 as a student in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. One of the minor changes she has noticed is a shift in student-athlete training schedules. Unlike when she was in high school, most athletes now participate in off-season training organized by coaches or captains. "It was just like you play that sport when it was that season, and it was up to you on your own to keep in shape," she says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32654"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The schools whose sports teams continuously dominate, on the other hand, haven't changed much. Blair physics teacher and girls' varsity basketball head coach Amy Ferguson graduated from Paint Branch High School in Burtonsville in 2007, where she played multiple sports. She has seen the up-county "W" schools (Walter Johnson, Walt Whitman, Thomas S. Wootton and Winston Churchill) have successful seasons both as a player and a coach. "The 'W' schools, Bethesda area, have been performing well as always," she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Math teacher and Walter Johnson class of 2011 graduate Grace Contreras has observed that ESOL classes are becoming less diverse. While English used to be the common language in the classes, now most students usually speak Spanish. "Everyone was coming from different places and speaking different languages so they were forced to learn English as a common tongue," she says, "whereas, now… even if [Spanish] isn't someone's first language, it gets picked up pretty quickly." This shift has been beneficial in determining how ESOL math classes work, but also prevents ESOL students from learning English.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The biggest change that Russell has noticed in the county since she was in high school is the students. Whereas she and her classmates participated in more traditional, individual forms of community service, like volunteering at a soup kitchen, students today participate in more attention-raising walkouts and protests that often take place during school. "It was much less massive mobilizations for institutional or systematic change, and I think that's something that I'm really impressed to see the county move towards," she says. Russell recalls that her activism consisted mostly of attending protests against the war in Iraq outside of school, since it was the major issue while she was a teenager.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">English teacher Erika Rao, who graduated from Sherwood High School in Olney in 2004, also remembers being invested in anti-war activism, both during and outside of school. She participated in her first walkout her junior year, and it was a big deal for her at the time. Although Olney is more left-leaning, the split between liberals and conservatives is greater than it is in other areas of the county. "There was some tension about when we walked out," she says, "You have to keep in mind that Sherwood is a little more evenly divided politically than Blair."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sherwood is also a lot less diverse than Blair, which influenced Rao's decision to move to Silver Spring and work at Blair after graduating from college. "When I came back to MCPS, I wanted to work at Blair because Blair is known for being a really well-integrated school," she says. She recalls that she was aware of Blair's diversity as a high schooler, but that many Olney inhabitants had and still have a perception of Silver Spring as a rough area. She thinks that one of the main reasons for this perception is that there's not much in Olney. "It's just residential houses and way too many grocery stores," she says. "My dad will come to Silver Spring and he thinks it's a chaotic area compared to Olney."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Russell's first perception of Blair, on the other hand, was that it was big and scary. She was a Magnet student at Eastern Middle School, which meant that everyday after school, she took a bus to Blair and waited for ninth period to end so she could catch her bus back home. "There was always a debate about whether you should go and use the bathroom in that typical sixth grade [sense]," she says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Stress is another change that Russell has noticed from when she was a student. "I don't remember [school] producing the same amount of anxiety that I sometimes see in my students, and that could have just been that we were all better at hiding it or it wasn't as socially acceptable to talk about," she says. She recalls that although she and her fellow IB classmates often had around five hours of homework per night, they had a mentality of "it gets done." It didn't matter how, when, or where it got done as long as it did eventually get done.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Contreras believes that students in Montgomery County specifically have always been stressed due to the competitive nature of the area, being around important people and institutions. She and math teacher and MCPS alumna Hannah Coleman think one beneficial stressor that today's students are missing out on is semester exams. "[Getting rid of final exams] probably reduces stress, which is a good thing, but I think there's benefits to having to recall information," Coleman says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rao believes that smartphones are a major contributor to increased student stress. "I think [smartphones] can actually cause a lot of anxiety because there are so many distractions and because your brain is overloaded with multitasking," she says. She and her peers didn't even text, resorting instead to note-passing. Contreras notes that while distracting, technology has increased digital literacy. "You're a lot more digitally fluent, you can do things we could never dream of," she says. In general, however, the multitude of apps that are available for students to use to distract themselves can be overwhelming, which increases students' stress.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite this stress that students today often subject themselves to, Russell is proud of all that they have done and continue to do in terms of activism and fighting for what they believe in. "It's easy to be like, 'oh, back in my day, I did five hours of homework and I didn't complain about it.' But everyone here does really amazing things, and they're so involved in their communities and in the larger world that I think that you guys are way better than I was in high school," she says.</span></p>	32654
33241	The recent spike in cases has made it more challenging for students to meet up with teammates	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For athletes, self-discipline and determination are essential for success. In the past months, the pandemic has tested the integrity of these qualities in Blair athletes, forcing them to adapt their training and mindset in order to prepare themselves for the future.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although Montgomery County plans to begin reopening schools on Feb. 1 if </span><a href="https://www.fox5dc.com/news/montgomery-county-public-schools-board-of-education-delays-in-person-return" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">health metrics allow</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, the current surge in COVID-19 cases across the county makes the return of in-person learning and sports more uncertain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Freshman Mikhail Seiken is on Blair's football team. Before the pandemic, Seiken had never taken football seriously. Once his friends started encouraging him to start playing, he went all in with his training."I lift pretty much every day after school… and then every weekend I have [wide] receiver training… with a private trainer," he says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Due to the recent COVID surge, Seiken has not been practicing with his Blair teammates, and has instead been training either by himself or with a small group of friends. "I've been encouraging a lot of my teammates to try to get out as much as they can in a safe way… and get in as much work as they can so that they're ready for the season," Seiken says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If it is safe to play football in the fall, Seiken plans to be a wide receiver for Blair's varsity team. In the meantime, he will continue to focus on his training for both its physical and mental benefits. "Just getting outside and running around really helps me get away from being on a screen all day."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Olivia Schulz also makes sure to get outside and exercise during her freetime. She has worked on her physical conditioning as a member of the softball team. "I'll do personal workouts daily or every other day, just to stay in shape, mostly just upper body and lower body," Schulz says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33239"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to playing softball for Blair, Schulz is also on a travel team. This fall, Schulz decided to stop attending her travel team's indoor batting practices because she wanted to protect herself and her family. "I want to make sure that I stay safe so that I can keep my family safe. That means no taking risks, like batting cages. I will do group practice outside, because you can stay a lot farther away [from other people]."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33240"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair Crew is another team sport that has had to adapt its practices to protect its athletes. Junior Colin Lederer, a varsity rower, has attended modified training sessions in the fall. As a safety measure, the rowers have been training in groups based on skill and gender.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the fall, Lederer trained with the same group of varsity boys. "It's basically a family. You become such a close group of people and you know everything about each other, you train with each other, and you feel like if you're not giving your all or having a bad day, you want to try as much as you can. So you're not letting everyone else down on the boat," Lederer says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He misses the Friday-night team dinners and Saturday-morning competitions, and laments that the team has not bonded in the same way it did last year. "I feel like that's taken away from a lot of getting to know the new people on the team."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair will follow the county's guidelines in deciding whether and how to allow students back to school, and how sports will happen during the second semester. In the meantime, student athletes are preparing the best they can so that when the time comes to perform, they'll be ready.</span></p>	33239
32909	The latest scandal and many other situations have arguably made Washington’s owner the worst in sports	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nobody believed the toxic culture of the Washington football team could get any worse under owner Daniel Snyder, until it did. A </span><a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:sKwf6D70xg8J:https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/16/redskins-sexual-harassment-larry-michael-alex-santos/+&amp;cd=4&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>Washington Post </em>article</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> recently detailed several sexual harassment allegations made by 15 female employees against multiple former senior officials in Washington’s front office, some of whom were in Snyder’s inner circle. These allegations span from 2006 to 2019 and have exposed Washington’s dysfunction once again. In response, the team hired lawyer Beth Wilkinson to review the franchise’s culture.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Dan Snyder himself was not accused of misconduct, but he has created a culture that promotes such behavior. Bullying employees, holding topless cheerleader photoshoots and refusing to change the team’s racist name until forced by sponsors are just some of the horrible incidents that have occurred during Snyder’s 21-year tenure as Washington’s owner. The foolishness of Dan Snyder has ruined the franchise and he has had enough chances to change the way he operates it. This scandal should be the final straw that causes the National Football League (NFL) to force him to sell the team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It would be in the best interests of the NFL and Washington to force Snyder out of the league. By forcing Snyder to sell the team because of this incident, it would send a message to the rest of the league that sexual misconduct is unacceptable. As owner, Snyder is responsible for handling these incidents. He has repeatedly failed to properly address incidents of this caliber and has shown no indication of changing his approach. Snyder has promised culture change before this scandal but nothing positive has come of it. If the NFL does not force Snyder out, it will highlight uninterest in setting a positive image for the league and ignorance towards the way he is running the team. Serious change starts at the top, so Snyder needs to go.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is very unlikely that Dan Snyder would voluntarily sell the team, so he would need to be forced. According to </span><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/sports/can-nfl-force-washington-owner-dan-snyder-sell-team" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Fox News</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, section 8.13 of the league constitution states the commissioner can determine if an owner “has been guilty of conduct detrimental to the League or professional football,” and choose to punish that owner with a fine or, in extreme cases, by pushing for a vote to strip them of team ownership. If at least 24 of the league’s 32 owners voted to remove Snyder, he would be forced to sell the team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There is no indication a vote is coming, but more information is likely to surface after the conclusion of Beth Wilkinson’s investigation into the team. It is unlikely Commissioner Roger Goodell and other owners would try to remove Snyder unless he is found to have been involved.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the hearts of almost all Washington fans, there is a special place of disdain for Daniel Snyder. He has transformed what was once among the most respected franchises in the league to one among the most disrespected, a laughing stock. The team’s record during his tenure has plummeted. Blowout losses, half empty stadiums with as many away fans as home fans and losing seasons are normal. Washington fans have desperately wanted to see him gone for years, and this incident gives fans another reason to feel that way. During a home blowout loss last season, fans chanted at Snyder to </span><a href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/video-redskins-fans-chant-sell-the-team-daniel-snyder-01dsxhne7v6z" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">sell the team</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Daniel Snyder has no place being the owner of an NFL team. By continuing to allow incidents like this to occur, he has shown he has not and will not learn how to run a team without making it a nightmare for anyone to work for. Either Snyder was somehow clueless for years about sexual misconduct happening right in front of him or he knew and didn't care enough to handle it. Both possibilities show he is extremely incompetent of holding any leadership position. A statement from the league is not enough and it is time for action beyond a meaningless fine to a billionaire. If Snyder is still the owner after this situation, the NFL is taking a huge risk by sending the message that there is no accountability. There will be more damage to what was once a great franchise and worst of all, there will be more scandals within the team and the league involving the mistreatment of women. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32910
32741	The Blazers bounced back from a rough streak to beat the Vikings in a nail-biting last regular-season game	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Feb. 21, Blair's boys varsity basketball team (14-8) finished off their regular season with a nail-biting victory over the Walt Whitman Vikings (11-11). The Blazers returned home after a three-game losing streak with a new sense of energy and team work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Right from the opening tip, it was obvious that the Blazers would have their work cut out for them. Blair’s starting five—junior guards Alfred Worrell Jr., Roman Cannuscio and Michael Ayala Jr., junior forward Tommy Waltz-Chesnaye and senior forward Abu-Bakarr Bangura—didn’t get a point off of the Vikings until almost halfway through the first quarter. With a tight defense and aggressive offense, Whitman dominated, but the Blazers stayed in the game with a few key threes by Cannuscio. The Blazers trailed 20-15 at the end of the first quarter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The beginning of quarter two consisted of more of the same from both teams, but toward the end of the quarter, Blair began to pick up some momentum. The Blazers drew foul after foul while not missing a single free throw and slowly closing the gap. The half ended with Blair behind only 34-32.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32740"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s momentum continued into the second half as they came to the court with a new sense of urgency. The Blazers opened up more offensive opportunities for themselves and pulled ahead of the Vikings. Midway through the third quarter, junior Alfred Worrell Jr. scored his one-thousandth career point, marking a memorable moment for both himself and Blair basketball. The gymnasium was full of energy as fans celebrated Worrell’s accomplishment and Blair began to take control of the game. The third quarter ended with the Blazers ahead 45-41.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair maintained a fast paced game and kept their lead throughout the fourth quarter. Whitman remained at the Blazers’ heels, but the Vikings could not match Blair’s energy. With nine seconds left in the game, the Vikings scored a three-pointer, narrowing Blair’s lead to two points, but losing 60-58 nonetheless.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“We played better together, moved the ball better and played better as a team,” Blair’s assistant coach Emanuel Charles said. After the game, Blair’s coaching emphasized the Blazer’s consistency and teamwork that lead them to the victory against Whitman. “A team like that is not going to shoot themselves in the foot that much. It’s really just about being consistent and not creating issues for ourselves,” said Blair’s head coach Damon Pigrom. Blair will hope to see more of the energy and teamwork shown at their final regular season game as they venture into the playoffs.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32740
33062	MCPS moves closer to the completion of its boundary study	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On October 20, WXY Studios released a public tool for the MCPS boundary study, marking a new phase of the project. </span><a href="https://interactiveboundaryexplorer.com/#interactive-tool" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">This online tool</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is for county members to examine how well schools score on a variety of criteria. This criteria includes student diversity, if the school is over or under capacity, and proximity of most of the students to the school. The tool is the summation of over a year's worth of data, and will be used not only to inform the public of the findings, but also as a concrete way for the organization to get feedback about the study in general. The data will be collected from now until mid- to late-December, when it will be summarized in a report to the county and used to inform important future decisions that could be needed.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33061"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Another important part of the new phase of the boundary study is the community engagement surrounding the online tool. To help with this, the website where the tool can be accessed also has a survey that MCPS wants users to fill out. This survey asks participants about patterns they see in the tool, ideas they might have for specific focuses, and has more general questions about the efficacy of the tool. Steve Brigham, a principal at Public Engagements Associates,a group that works mainly on reaching out to the public during projects and facilitating dialogues, emphasized the importance of the survey. “We’re really pushing out the message that we want as many residents as possible to use the tool, but not only use it, but fill out the survey answering about two dozen questions on what are their insights, issues, views, perspectives, or concerns around the tool,” Brigham said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Over the course of the boundary study, many people have had only a general idea of its purpose, making the tool an attempt to clarify the study. This includes senior Emiliya Gebru, who, like many students, has heard of the study but never really looked at it. “So I know a little bit from my friends that it’s something about diversity in schools, but that’s pretty much it,” Gebru said. For this reason, one of the main challenges that the tool attempts to address are the concerns or misunderstandings that people might have about it. As explained by this </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/schools/the-basics-what-to-know-about-the-mcps-districtwide-boundary-analysis/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Bethesda Beat</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> article written in 2019, the boundary study hoped to discover ways in which MCPS schools could be used more effectively, but not to give any plans of action, or even clearly state that anything had to be done.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to collecting demographics, community meetings were also held, where people could meet and discuss their opinions on the study. Brigham explains that among the concerns that parents brought up was the fact that many chose where to buy their house based on schools, and a change to boundaries could impact that. “An issue, which we heard loud and clear in the first phase, is that people choose to buy a house or live in a certain part of the county based on schools, especially if they have kids or are planning to have kids, so it raises anxiety levels if they fear that’s going to change,” Brigham said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Currently, the study is in its second phase, with more online meetings planned over the next few months, with a culminating report in January. Once MCPS has all of the information collected throughout this process, they have said they will use it as a database for county members to look through and let them understand the problems that individual schools might face. No changes have been planned, and MCPS has stressed that the study will not directly result in any boundary shifts. More information can be found </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/publicinfo/boundary-analysis/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">here</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> on the MCPS website.</span></p>	33061
33003	Blazers react to the Breonna Taylor verdict	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32839"></div><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some students we interviewed for this story asked to remain anonymous. We will be referring to them using an alternate first name.</em></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The facts of the case are far from clear, but this is what we know.</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the night of Friday, March 13, officers from the Louisville Police Department executed a "knock and announce" narcotics search warrant at the apartment where Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, was staying with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When the officers broke down the door to Taylor's apartment, Walker fired a single shot and struck Officer Jonathan Mattingly in the thigh. Officer Mattingly and Officer Myles Cosgrove returned fire, killing Taylor. She was not given medical attention until more than 20 minutes after she was shot, by which point she had passed away.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On September 23, a Kentucky grand jury indicted Officer Brett Hankison on three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment for firing blindly into the apartment of Taylor's white neighbors during the raid. The grand jury concluded that Hankison's actions had displayed an "extreme indifference" to the lives of Taylor's white neighbors. For each charge he is found guilty of, Hankison faces between one and five years of imprisonment. Officers Mattingly and Cosgrove were not charged for the shots that killed Breonna Taylor.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The decision not to charge any of the officers with Breonna Taylor's killing has ignited a burst of protests, riots, and activism throughout the United States. It has forced us to ask ourselves, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Where do we go from here?</em></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers against the verdict</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Freshman Savannah Brown captured the reaction that many Blazers had to the verdict. "This angers me and breaks my heart. Breonna along with many beautiful souls passed away due to the U.S.'s corrupt and oppressive system," Brown says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, Brown and other Blair students weren't surprised by this verdict. In fact, they expected it. For years, they have heard the names of Black men and women who were killed by police, and usually their deaths do not result in police being held accountable. In this case, Taylor’s killers weren’t even sent to trial.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For Junior Julian Hutchins, the verdict represents the opposite of justice. "I think the lack of really any significant action is blatantly saying, 'We can legally kill black people and get away with it.' That reality is scary to accept, and having to fight against that every day is extremely draining," Hutchins says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Bracklinn Williams believes that those officers should at least have had a trial. "An indictment is not a statement of guilt. It's a statement that there are questions that need answering. And we have a lot of questions," Williams says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Marta Woodward, a biology teacher at Blair, emphasizes the need to change the legal system that prevented the grand jury from charging the officers who killed Taylor. "From a legal standpoint, you can see how the verdict came down, but I think the legal standpoint doesn't tell the whole story. The legal basis may have been sound, but the law has to be changed because it [Taylor's death] should never have happened, and sometimes that's just the discrepancy between what the law can offer and what true justice offers," Woodward says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Michaella Sevalie explains how the ongoing problem of police brutality worries many people of color. "As a Black female, I am scared that if I am wrongfully murdered, my court case will have the same fate as Breonna's, and that frightens me," she says. Sevalie believes that this verdict cannot be defended, but some Blazers think otherwise.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers who think the verdict is just</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some Blazers feel that the decision not to charge officers with killing Breonna Taylor was justified. "It was a completely fair verdict and the media has been lying about this case the entire time," Joe, a junior, says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Joe rejects the claim that Taylor's killing was related to racism. "Her boyfriend fired shots at the police and they responded by shooting back. Her death is unfortunate, but a tragedy does not make a crime," he says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Andrew, a Blair sophomore, believes that the officers who shot Breonna Taylor should be fired and charged with wanton endangerment, not murder. "I think the verdict is a little soft on the officers, but not by much… police officers did not want to kill anyone," says Andrew.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ultimately, he thinks that the grand jury made the right decision. "The verdict is valid. I may disagree a bit, but that's not for me to decide," he says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sam, Blair junior, holds beliefs that are similar to Andrew's and Joe's. "Breonna Taylor was merely collateral damage in that fight, the police were not in the wrong and the jury made the right decision," he says.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is nothing new.</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rosemary McCloskey is a mother to two Black sons at Blair and a representative for the NAACP Parents' Council on the Blair PTSA. For her family, the decision not to charge the officers with killing Breonna Taylor was sad, but not shocking. For parents of children of color, there is always a fear that their children will not be seen for who they are. There is a fear that peoples' racial prejudices will endanger the lives of their loved ones.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students of color in Montgomery County have been experiencing racial discrimination-- whether through the form of microaggressions or blatant racism-- for as long as the county has existed. For them, it's nothing new.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">McCloskey carries a constant awareness for how other people, especially White people, see her sons. "I think there's a certain amount of sadness and vigilance that parents of kids of color carry around, that people don't see our kids as they are. And there's a vigilance for how we educate and empower and protect our kids to give them the armor they need to thrive," she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rahman Culver, Blair's Diversity and Inclusion Instructional Coordinator, believes that holding the officers accountable is an important step in changing our country's legal and judicial systems that led to the killing of Breonna Taylor. "We have to have uncomfortable conversations. People have flaws, they make mistakes, and you can still be a person worthy of forgiveness and restoration even if you are held accountable for something you did wrong," he says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Andrew believes that the central issue in Breonna Taylor's killing is how the officers were trained and that they should not be charged with murder. "The real issue is the system behind the police officers... That's what needs to be changed. I don't think this is a judicial matter at heart, it's a systemic matter."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The majority of Blair students believe that the officers who killed Breonna Taylor should be held accountable. For some, the killing exemplifies how the United States' police institutions are fundamentally racist. Others insist the verdict is fair and that her death is a tragedy, not a crime.</span></p>	32839
33064	Luke Bracey and Emma Roberts star in a rom-com that is funny but also demeaning	<p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Warning: There are spoilers in this review.</em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Directed by John Whiteshell, “Holidate” (released on Oct. 28, 2020) is a Netflix romantic comedy that follows the relationship of Sloane (Emma Roberts) and Jackson (Luke Bracey). Previous heartbreaks cause both to struggle to find love again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On one fateful Christmas day, Jackson and Sloane cross paths at the mall. Instantly arguing with each other over a store line, the two eventually start a deeper conversation about how frustrating it is to be single on the holidays. When they run into her Aunt Susan’s (Kristin Chenoweth) holidate, Sloane tells Jackson about how her aunt finds a guy to date every single holiday. Jackson proposes that he and Sloane be each other’s holidate so they don't have to be single on holidays anymore. Turning down the offer at first, Sloane later agrees when she runs into her ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend on Valentine’s Day. The&nbsp;film then jumps from holiday to holiday, following Jackson and Sloane’s interactions. Like in any true rom-com, the situation doesn’t turn out exactly like they initially expected.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the appealing romantic storyline, it's not possible to avoid the sexist dialogue. The writing feeds the stereotypes that society is trying to eliminate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Before Jackson met Sloane, he broke up with his date on Christmas because “chicks go mental on holidays.” While at the gym, Jackson and his friend Neil (King Bach), start talking about the problems with girls. Neil says “they got these crazy eyes,” while Jackson criticizes girls for being “real.” Jackson further adds the reason friends with benefits never works is because “women are hardwired to attach and procreate.” Society often writes women off as emotional and clingy and this belief is emphasized in Jackson’s lines.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This film is not just misogynistic; it's also misandrist. When Jackson says that the clinginess of girls is the reason why friends with benefits never works, Sloane fires back with the argument that “men are hardwired to panic and flee.” Sloane explains to Jackson how men “can just dump us and move on.” As the film goes on you can see in many women's lines and men's actions the stereotype that men can’t be loyal or commit to one girl.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout the film, Sloane’s mother, Elaine (Frances Fisher), dedicates much of her own energy to finding her daughter a partner or encouraging Sloane to make something out of her holidate situation with Jackson. The demoralizing message the film portrays here is that being single is a bad thing. The film makes it look like a person can't be happy unless they have a partner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the upside, the acting between the two main leads brought Sloan and Jackson’s relationship to life. Sloane’s emotion during her monologue at the end of the movie is incredibly touching. Jackson finally letting his feelings out in the grocery store on Thanksgiving gives the audience a warm feeling inside that causes immense happiness. Their joyful teary eyes, unbelievably realistic looks of happiness and saddening fight scenes go so far in explaining how talented these actors are.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Another bonus of this film is the humorous moments. The film creators went in the right direction when they included a remake of the last scene of “Dirty Dancing.” Jackson lifting Sloane over his head while the DJ played “The Time of My Life” is and will always be a magical moment, and the rib-tickling incident that happens immediately after is one of the major highlights of the movie.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Unfortunately, the comedy of this movie is not enough to make up for the disappointing film writing. The hard truth is that nothing about this film gets the viewer deliberating about it later on.&nbsp;This is the type of movie you watch once and forget.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Holidate” is rated TV-MA for some inappropriate language and is now available to stream on Netflix.</em></p>	33063
32261	Seniors reflect on their last games as Blazers	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior night for a sport is always a bittersweet moment for seniors leaving their team. Players collect countless memories that they will never forget, from hanging out with teammates to representing their schools in games throughout their Blair career.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Zaire Cooper, Football</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although Cooper isn't the biggest fan of practice, he loves being with his teammates. "Something I’ll miss the most quite honestly will be practice, which is weird because I’d be the first to tell you I hate practice," he says and laughs. "But just being able to hang around with the boys and hang out in the locker room afterwards and talk about how so and so messed up and joke about what happened on this play and that play," Cooper says. Cooper has earned three Division I athletic scholarship offers as of Oct. 27, including Davidson College, Concord University and Morgan State University. Cooper explains how the Blair football program has educated him and built him to the player he is. "My knowledge for football has grown so much here and that’s what has made me a Division 1 player. That’s what I appreciate the most," Cooper says. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32260"></div><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Noa Dorah, Girls' Soccer</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another four-year varsity player, Dorah has seen her team accomplish some historical feats. The Blazers defeated Richard Montgomery for the first time in eight years, earned two sectional titles and won four division titles in four years during Dorah's Blair career. “We continue to break records and make school history which is always exciting,” Dorah says. The great team dynamic at Blair is something she hopes transfers over to her future athletic career at St. Francis University. “I look forward to a similar team dynamic in college. I’ll be training with my team there every day and I think I’ll be able to find something similar to the dynamic at Blair,” she says. The girls’ soccer team defeated Parkdale in the Class 4A North Region championship and will continue fighting for a state championship.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Olivia Freer, Girls' Volleyball</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a four-year varsity player, Freer learned from older players during her early years on the team. "Playing immediately on varsity got me accustomed to a higher level of play very quickly, as well as it introduced me to older players and their leadership styles early on in my career," Freer says. She also sees the sport to be an opportunity to be better connected to her school, both with the people and representing the school. "Playing for Blair teams have been great experiences. Not only do I get to keep up with my sport and represent my school, but I get to create and develop friendships with my fellow schoolmates," she says. This is also something Freer looks to continue, as she is deliberating on a school to move forward with her academic and athletic career. The girls' volleyball team will play on the road in the Class 4A North Region II championship on Nov. 6 at 6:00 p.m against Sherwood.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Brennan Moore, Boys' Soccer</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moore will miss the people that have surrounded him throughout his athletic career at Blair. "I'm one hundred percent going to miss all the people I've met here. Everyone from my first coach, Ms. Cole, to Ms. Meghan and Ms. Boule. I'm also going to miss all of my teammates and of course Coach Hernandez. I can't thank them enough," he says. Moore verbally committed to play college soccer at Mount St. Mary's University on Oct. 13. He looks forward to representing his school and meeting new people. "Playing college soccer has always been a dream of mine. Being able to continue to represent my school is going to be amazing, and I look forward to meeting a whole new group of people as well," Moore says. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While all of these student athletes may be moving on to their next chapter in collegiate athletics, they will never forget the memories they made in their Blazer colors.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32260
32239	The bill aims to end race-based discrimination against natural hair in the workplace	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sept. 24, Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando and Council President Nancy Navarro introduced </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/council/Resources/Files/agenda/col/2019/20190924/20190924_7A.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Bill 30-19</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, also called Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (Montgomery County CROWN Act). The bill prohibits discrimination against certain protective hairstyles generally associated with race such as braids, locs, afros, curls and twists.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"The goal of Bill 30-19… is to ultimately end race-based discrimination based on hair and eradicate the notion that profession and appropriate hairstyles are coded to only really mean white standards of grooming and beauty," Jawando said in the bill's </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyxkuFHubH8" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">council session</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The CROWN Act in Montgomery County mirrors similar, larger-scale laws enacted in California and New York. California state senator Holly J. Mitchell introduced the original CROWN Act on Apr. 22, and California’s state assembly voted 69-0 to pass the bill on June 27. The CROWN Coalition, created by personal care brand Dove in partnership with the National Urban League, Color of Change and the Western Center on Law and Poverty, sponsored Mitchell's act.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to Dove's </span><a href="https://www.thecrownact.com/research" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">CROWN Research Study</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, black women in the U.S. are 80 percent more likely to change their natural hair to meet expectations at work, and their natural hair is 3.4 times more likely to be regarded as unprofessional. The coalition's mission is to pass the CROWN Act in every state and eliminate the hair discrimination revealed in their study "to create a more equitable and inclusive beauty experience for black women and girls."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Quan'ell Kitchen expressed enthusiasm regarding the introduction of the bill in Montgomery County. "I love that they brought this bill into this area… Maryland is a very diverse area, and we need a bill to help people who have natural hair and don’t want to assimilate to other people's hair types," Kitchen said. "It will change how people see other people's hair: "Oh that’s the way her hair is, its beautiful, I like it.""</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair english teacher Donna Whitney, who has worn her natural hair since age 21, shared her past experience with hair discrimination to express her approval of the CROWN Act. "I worked in industry for a car rental company after college, and I was not promoted [because of my natural hair]. Other people who came in after me did," Whitney said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Whitney believes that passing the bill will nurture understanding and initiate discussion on self expression and race. "People should be allowed to express themselves and [others should]</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">understand that one way of looking at things is not necessarily </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">the </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">way," Whitney said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jawando explained that the passage of the bill will give anyone who feels discriminated against based on hairstyle the ability to file a civil lawsuit and seek action through the Office of Civil Rights. The act would be filed under Section 27-6 of the Human Rights and Civil Liberties of the Montgomery County code.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some individuals in the county, like Blair math teacher Crystal Brown, are skeptical of the bill's ability to prevent discrimination. "I think that people will find loopholes in other ways to hide the fact that they're discriminating on a person, potentially based on their hair. I think it may prevent people from coming out and saying "you can't wear your hair like this" … or that it's unprofessional," Brown said.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32238"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While Jawando acknowledged the act does not represent the end of discrimination in Montgomery County, he hopes it is a valuable step. "With this legislation, Montgomery County can move closer towards who we aspire to be, a more inclusive county that is focused on racial and ethnic equity," Jawando wrote to his Councilmembers.</span></p>	32238

Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Kobe Bryant. MJ had the brand, the swagger that made him so iconic. LeBron was the prodigy, a freak of nature who could do everything on the court. And Kobe. Well Kobe got buckets, clutch buckets, jaw-dropping buckets. Over the span of his twenty year NBA career, Kobe scored at ease and did so with the mindset that lived on well after he retired four years ago. "Mamba Mentality" he called it: The belief that you can always be your best self, on and off the court.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Sunday, we lost Kobe Bryant. On the way to coach his thirteen year-old daughter Gianna's travel basketball game, Bryant and Gianna, along with seven others, were killed in a helicopter accident in Calabasas, Calif. Bryant is survived by his wife Vanessa, his daughters Natalia, Bianka and Capri, his sisters Sharia and Shaya, his father Joe and his mother Pam.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When the news broke on Twitter at around two o'clock on the east coast, there was a palpable sense of disbelief across the sports world. No one could believe that such a great man could die in such a sad way. Kobe touched people's lives. First of all, his play on the court was incredible. 18 time All-Star, 5 time NBA Champion, MVP. The list goes on and on. When the Lakers needed clutch points, the ball was always in Kobe's hands. There are probably thousands of kids in their driveways right now, attempting to replicate his iconic one-legged fadeaway jumper, yelling "KOBE" up to the heavens as the ball leaves their hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What was so special about Kobe is that he was an extraordinary person off of the court. In today's world of superficial athletes who make millions of dollars every year, few spend time helping out the regular guy like Kobe. From comforting drivers at the scene of a random car crash, to creating the Mamba Sports Academy for underprivileged aspiring athletes, Kobe was always ready to lend a helping hand. His unmatched work ethic and passion has inspired several people to put in hours on end into the things they love. Kobe is a huge inspiration for not only endless basketball players around the world, but also numerous people that just want to have an impact in their communities.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32642"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The tributes and prayers from people around the world after his death exemplified the impact Kobe had on the sports world. The stories were gut wrenching yet inspiring. Atlanta Hawks star Trae Young wore number 8 in his game on Sunday against the Wizards, a tribute to his fallen hero. In games on Sunday, several teams started the game with each team taking a 24-second violation and an 8-second violation. Hundreds of Lakers fans took time out of their day to go down to the Staples Center and say one last goodbye to Kobe at the place in which they saw him shine. In the face of this horrific tragedy, it was nice to see people around the world put their differences aside and grieve for Kobe together, not as Democrats or Republicans, not as Lakers fans or Sixers fans, but as one understanding community.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This story will be updated with more stories from basketball fans in the local community.</em></p><p><br></p>	32642
33266	What Blair students and teachers think about online school so far.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first quarter has come to a close, and teachers and students alike are starting to adjust to the new schedule. Although online school has been somewhat successful in providing students with a proper education, some improvements still need to be made in order for online school to completely be a success. For instance, the lack of socialization between classmates and the lack of student-teacher interaction is both negatively affecting student learning styles and teacher instructing styles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many students prefer in-person school since they can talk to their friends and see other people. In an online environment, the classroom structure consists of the teacher talking uninterrupted with little to no interaction between students. Sophomore Anushka Poddar further expresses her dislike but sympathizes with teachers. "The teachers don't have much choice with what they can do in their one hour and a lot of classes are just lectures," says Poddar.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Online school has also negatively impacted many students' mental health. Besides the absence of socialization, students are unable to access the resources they need: for instance, counseling services. </span><a href="https://edsource.org/2020/student-anxiety-depression-increasing-during-school-closures-survey-finds/631224" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">In a recent survey conducted in South California by EdSource</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, 22% of the surveyed students who needed mental health services before now didn't have access to those services.n additional 32% also stated that their mental health needs have increased since the start of online school and quarantine. Junior Aiesha Chaudhary attests to her mental health, noting that she couldn't get help when she needed it. "The biggest problem is it's a lot harder to get help when you need it." Chaudhray says. She also emphasizes how her friends helped maintain her mental health state too. "I didn't realize how much I benefited from being able to sit next to people in a class," she says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Teachers and staff are also having trouble with easily accessing online school. A big part of online school is knowing how to access and use specific technology, such as Zoom or Canvas, but not all teachers are familiar with it. Additionally, technology is unreliable as English teacher Leigh Tinsley agrees. "The biggest challenge is just putting things online." Tinsley says. "I feel like everything with technology takes a long time, takes a lot longer than going to a copy machine and making photocopies of stuff."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33265"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As Blair’s Academies Coordinator, Beth Sanchez guides all the teachers that lead the academies and supports the teachers in getting information out to students. She also provides resources to the teachers and coordinates capstone projects. "It [online school] has made outreach very difficult, we've had to really think outside the box," says Sanchez. "How do we reach middle schoolers or Blair students and let them know how to get involved in the academies?"&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) and the Board of Education needs to address these problems, for students and staff. Mental health is a serious issue and there need to be more resources for students. Online school was not an easy adjustment, but with some solutions, we can all start to see change in our quarantine lifestyles.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As for solutions, some things that could be done to improve virtual learning would concern motivation and class participation. Many teachers teach lecture-style with Zoom classes rather than giving students time to discuss topics and learn from one another. Giving out breakout room time has proved helpful for students to learn about their classmates and listen to new perspectives. Another thing that can be done is increasing leniency on deadlines. As students struggle with their mental health and respective workloads, it's important to keep in mind that they're doing the best they can considering the situation they're in.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite its shortcomings, online school has some positive impacts. For one, students are getting more sleep since the start time of school is now 9 a.m. compared to the previous 7:45 a.m. for high schoolers. Sophomore Julia Maynard agrees that the Wednesdays were a great idea because it provides a short break and gives an opportunity for educational support. "I have a choice to go see my teachers or the choice to kind of take the day off to do homework," explains Maynard. Poddar also explored a further positive of online school, saying, "It [online school] saves me time on my commute and I don't have to wake up super early."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Right now, there are hopes to go back to in-person school in 2021 if our county can meet certain guidelines. Until then, students and staff are doing their best to adapt to virtual learning and to come up with solutions as needed.

33296	How blocking post office funding widens the national class divide.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWhile neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night prevents the post office from delivering the mail, the federal government aiming to defund it might. Over the past few months, President Donald Trump has expressed his opposition to funding the United States Postal Service (USPS) on the grounds that he fears voting by mail will increase voter fraud.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33294"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The post office as we know it</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tArticle I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to establish post offices and post roads (mail routes). As a result, the USPS has existed in some capacity since 1775.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t“The post office helped to create America,” Jamie Raskin, the elected representative for Maryland’s 8th Congressional District, says. “Before we had a post office, [we] had 13 separate, distant, and disconnected colonies, really with their own currencies, their own commercial lives, their own cultural and political lives. [The post office] gave us the skeleton of a national economy, a national communications system, and national politics.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;Contrary to popular belief, the USPS is a government agency, not a government-owned corporation, and was never meant to turn a profit. The USPS has managed to stay afloat in recent years despite receiving little to no federal funding, but it has been running a large debt for some time and mainly subsists on funds from postage and package sales.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAs the election approaches, the post office needs a sizable amount of money to prepare for the influx of mail-in ballots. The bipartisan, Trump-appointed Board of Governors tasked with finding the exact amount of money the USPS needs this budget cycle placed the estimate at $25 billion. Trump has repeatedly bashed this number, saying it will go to “fraudulent” voting, going so far as to call the mail-in votes “the greatest fraud in the history of elections.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIf Congress passes a relief bill to fund the USPS, however, then Trump, as the chief executive of the nation, must carry out its will. “Congress has the power to establish a post office. Congress has the power to say here's how the post office will operate,” Mark Graber, a </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Regents Professor at the University System of Maryland </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">and one of the country’s leading experts on constitutional law and politics, says. “If Congress passes a law that says the post office should be delivering the mail, the President has an obligation to… execute that law.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tTrump can attempt to veto the spending bill that will fund the post office, but if Congress overrides his veto with a supermajority vote––or a two-thirds majority––Trump cannot deny the USPS funding.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Local ramifications</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAlthough Trump’s calls to defund the post office stem from his concern of fraudulent voting, his actions affect many of the post office’s other important functions. “I had lots of constituents who were waiting for their heart medication, or if they were diabetic, their insulin. People were extremely agitated about where their medicines were,” Raskin says. “There were also tons of small businesses that were having problems either receiving materials or sending out packages.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMany demonstrations have sprung up in the Montgomery County area protesting Trump’s call to block funding for the USPS and the subsequent ramifications that the local community has already begun to experience. Anna White, a Silver Spring resident who organized a protest at the Silver Spring post office, says, “The message of the rallies was to save the postal service, and not remove any more [mail deposit boxes].” White also emphasized the protestors’ desire to “make sure we can trust in the postal service to mail ballots––and for our democracy.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33295"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Election implications</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFor the Montgomery County Board of Elections (BOE), Trump’s threats to the post office are not a tremendous cause of concern. The Board has developed alternate methods of submitting ballots that don’t rely on postal services, according to Gilberto Zelaya, the public information officer at the Montgomery County BOE. “Once you get your ballot, you have two options: you either send it back through the post office, but if you're really concerned about the post office, then you have up to 50 ballot drop boxes,” Zelaya says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tZelaya emphasizes that problems with the post office should not impede a voter’s ability to cast their vote: “If you think that the post office is a barrier, then use the ballot dropbox.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tPart of the reason that Montgomery County fares better than other parts of the countryis that the county has greater access to resources than other areas of the United States. The average income in Montgomery County is over $30,000 more than the national average income. More money from taxes equates to a higher budget for the BOE.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe Montgomery County BOE’s budget is $8,375,091. In comparison, the entire state of New York’s BOE has a budget of $11.6 million. The state of Alabama comes in with $8,646,239, only slightly more than Montgomery County. As Raskin says, “Maryland as a state has made pretty substantial investments in the electoral system.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDue to its large budget, Montgomery County does not have to worry about focusing on&nbsp;one voting option over another to save money. This financial freedom allows Montgomery County to run a hybrid method of voting, giving its citizens many different ways to vote.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBallot boxes, for example, are a costly endeavor. The average ballot box costs about $6,000, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s Elections Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council, which means that the Montgomery County BOE spends around $300,000 on ballot boxes alone. However, the box itself is not the only cost, as they are cleared out twice a day and must be monitored.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAnother benefit Montgomery County voters have access to is accurate and plentiful information. “People who live in our district have access to a lot of good information,” Raskin says. “We're able to sort through all the propaganda and disinformation that has been put out. So in that sense, we're more resilient to recover from the effects of all the president's propaganda.” Despite this, Raskin furthers, “...everybody needs to have a voting plan.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMontgomery County’s affluence has given the area the ability to overcome the obstacle of a weakened USPS. But, for less wealthy parts of the country and localities with less funding allocated for elections, Trump’s funding block could prove to be a much bigger problem.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Implications for the rest of the country</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWhile the post office claims it will be able to keep up with the influx of mail-in ballots, it has also released statements saying that voters should mail their ballots at least a week before the election to make sure that they get in on time. This means that voters will need to submit their ballots on Oct. 27, a week before the official Election Day of Nov. 3, to ensure their votes are counted.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThese potential shipping delays could have a significant impact on the election due to</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">policies in some states that prohibit counting late mail-in ballots. In the 2020 Democratic presidential primary election, over 65,000 ballots were rejected because they arrived late. With over 30 percent of the total ballots cast in this election predicted to be sent through the mail, the USPS will be attempting to process a significantly larger number of ballots than it did in the primaries. To facilitate mail-in voting, nine states plus Washington, D.C. are mailing ballots to all registered voters;nine other states, including Maryland, are mailing applications for requesting a mail-in ballot to all registered voters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Unfounded voter fraud</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tTrump has repeatedly accused mail-in voting of causing rampant voter fraud, saying, “We want people to vote so that when they vote, it means one vote.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHowever, there is little evidence of voter fraud increasing substantially with mail-in ballots. In fact, there is little evidence of voter fraud actually being a problem in United States elections at all. “There's almost been as much voter fraud as there has been alien invasion,” Graber says. “No president has ever worried about mail-in voting fraud because it doesn't happen.” Despite evidence to the contrary, the president still insists on denying the USPS funding on these grounds.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHistorically, the Republican Party––which Trump is a part of––has tended to benefit from absentee and mail-in voting. “The Republicans have always been able to use effective absentee balloting and they have won big races and small races because of it,” Sarah Farnsworth, a local election judge, says. “They know how to run that structure this year. They could have easily done very well by this, except that their White House occupant is giving a totally different message than the message that they have honed and perfected for over 40 years.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tTrump’s recent attacks on the post office have created many potential issues for voters. With COVID-19 still affecting thousands nationwide, and lower-income areas disproportionately bearing the brunt, those who live in the least affluent areas or in localities with less money set aside for elections will be the most impacted by the results of the coming election––and the most likely to have their votes jeopardized.</span></p>	33294
33005	Blair students may be surprised to hear that Blair staff members are having the same feelings of loneliness and isolation as they are	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“It takes a certain kind of person to work at a school,” says Alain Perron, Montgomery Blair High School’s Building Service manager. “Yes, there are some people that come in and collect a paycheck, but then there are some people that are committed to the reason why we’re here...They want to do their best so that the students can succeed; they’re proud of doing their best so that the students can succeed,” Perron says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For many Blair staff members in the Building Service, Secretarial and Security departments, doing their job brings them joy. They work hard because no matter how difficult their jobs may be at times, they have the reward of being a part of the Montgomery Blair community, and most of all, to work with its students.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33004"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, Blair staff members are now entering an unprecedented era for schooling, just like Blair students. An era in which the normally noisy, rambunctious and most of all, alive building seems like a quiet shell of its former self.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">School secretary Glenda Lopez says that staff members believe the building feels empty. “We have pretty much 3,000 students. Lunchtime, it gets noisy even though we are away from the cafeteria, but we can hear them," she says. "It’s extremely quiet, now that we don’t have the students. So, it’s a different ball game.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Perron and his staff feel similarly, though he believes in the decision MCPS has made to remain virtual for the first semester. “I think it was probably the safest thing. I know it’s hard on students, I know it’s incredibly difficult. I mean, this is not an easy year for the students...but given the options, I think it was the wisest move,” Perron says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Darryl Cooper, Blair’s security team leader similarly feels sympathy and concern for the students in remote learning, but especially for those with issues. He believes the social interaction found in school can be important for these kids learning to move past any mistakes they make. “Them seeing that mistakes happen and they’re not judged or treated differently afterwards is a part of what they need to see...to grow,” Cooper says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The responsibilities of staff members from all over Blair have changed as a result of COVID-19. Instead of just resolving disciplinary issues and performing security rounds, one of the new responsibilities Cooper and the security team share is partaking in frequent Zoom meetings. “[The] job has actually changed somewhat because it’s not as much hands-on mediations with kids. But now you’re just trying to find a way to support kids in a different way,” Cooper says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lopez is adjusting to the new responsibilities she has because of the lack of students in the building. “Most of my job is to attend to students and their parents. Since we don’t have the students, we are just dealing mostly with parents over the phone,” Lopez says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">And not only do Perron and his staff have to clean the school and beautify it for when students come back, the immense job of keeping the building clean and safe for all its staff members falls on their shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While Perron and his staff would like to have students back in the building, he’s not in any rush for that to happen. He believes the burden of keeping the school safe and sanitary would only increase if over 3,000 students were in the building.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The feelings of loneliness and isolation felt by Blair students outside of the building are the same ones felt by staff members inside of it. Yet Cooper feels relief to be able to work again with his fellow staff members. “It breaks the monotony...For me, it’s somewhat of a relief to be able to go to work,” Cooper says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">﻿And even though there are still no students in the building, Lopez remains hopeful. “I like what I do. So, even though [it’s] empty, I know it’s going to be only for a period of time...If I take one day at a time, I know it’s going to be better soon. And the better we take care of ourselves now, we’re gonna have a better outcome in the near future,” Lopez says.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33004
33123	Teachers are using a wide variety of online programs and applications to educate and engage their students	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Education has taken on a new meaning over the past six months. The classroom has greatly changed and no longer represents a physical space, but a virtual one. Due to the new nature of online learning, teachers have started using new applications and programs to make the best of their situation. There are a few central tools that all teachers are using, but for the most part it is up to them to find innovative ways to engage students and project their lessons in a clear and interesting way.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33122"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) along with many other school districts across the country are using the video communications platform Zoom to hold online classes. Within Zoom there are a variety of tools that teachers are able to use such as breakout rooms, polls and screen sharing. Another application often used in combination with Zoom is Nearpod. Nearpod allows students to engage in the lesson with teachers by having their own version of the slide show.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Grace Ebobola uses Nearpod often in her English class. “We join the presentation by [a] code that is given to us in order to see what’s going on in the lesson,” Ebobola says. One of the main benefits of Nearpod is how it engages students. “Students can interact with the presentation to submit answers for questions [and] polls,” Ebobola explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">An application similar to Nearpod is Peardeck. Ebobola noted that her English teacher uses Peardeck as well. This application also gives students a link or code where they can follow along with a presentation on their own computer, so they don’t have to just look at their teacher’s screen.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While some teachers are using Peardeck and Nearpod, others are also using Quizlet and Kahoot to engage students. Freshman Christian Limjuco’s teachers are using these tools in their classes. “These tools seem helpful because it’s a more fun way to learn other than just Zoom,” Limjuco notes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">There are some subject-specific programs teachers have access to.One of these programs helpful to math teachers is the online graphing application, Desmos. This allows students to graph different equations and&nbsp;find certain points and intersections on graphs. In addition, Delta can be used to practice problems. Jenkins finds Desmos and Delta Math to be two of the most helpful online programs her teachers are using. “Delta Math gives you attempts when answering problems and helps work out the equation after. I also really like the online graphing calculator if mine is dead,” Jenkins says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition, MCPS schools are utilizing the program Canvas to organize assignments and resources for students. This comes as a change for some teachers who have previously used Google Classroom to organize work and modules for students. However, Canvas may not be the most easy application to navigate for teachers and some students. Sophomore Kai Jenkins doesn’t find Canvas to be user friendly. “[It] sometimes will mess up your grade on a quiz even if you got it correct. It’s sometimes hard to navigate when it comes to turning in work and where to turn it in,” Jenkins explains. Assignments can also be placed in multiple places making them more difficult to find at times.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Luckily, many teachers are understanding about the challenges surrounding online learning. “T</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">hey [teachers] will fix any problems if they see it, or if you bring it up to them. They also involve students when asking for help so everyone is on the same page,” Jenkins says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">While some classes are more conducive to online learning, others are not. Classes that require hands on work or labs can be difficult to adapt to the online setting. In Jenkins’ chemistry class, students are doing some labs online. In addition to online labs and simulations, some teachers are cutting out hands on activities from the curriculum that cannot be replicated over a screen.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Marta Woodward teaches AP Biology at Blair, a class that features many hands-on activities and labs. To make up for the loss of in class time that she would usually rely on she must rely on virtual labs or videos of labs for students to watch. Unfortunately, this virtual format is not as good as in person learning. “It's not the same at all, and this is the biggest loss in science teaching virtually,” Woodward explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Woodward is making the best of this situation by utilizing tools such as Nearpod, Edpuzzle, Kahoot, and Screencastify to teach her class. Many activities can be completed to somewhat the same level as they would be in a normal classroom setting. “Most activities can be translated to a virtual setting, but not completely; it often feels like there's something missing,” Woodward says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A resource widely used by AP teachers is the AP Classroom website. On this website, teachers can assign videos as well as assignments and practice quizzes or assessments. AP teachers from across the country film videos of themselves explaining different topics to provide a variety of in-depth explanations for students. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Online learning has been a large adjustment for not only students, but teachers as well as they try to navigate uncharted territory when it comes to what programs work best for students and their class. While some applications are easier than others, teachers are using a combination to make the most of their classes despite their inability to teach in person.

32920	Washington failed to make the playoffs during its time in the NBA bubble, finishing 1-7, but the future is bright	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports, magic was nowhere to be seen for the Washington Wizards, as they were eliminated from playoff contention during the NBA’s playoff qualifiers. Washington finished its time in the bubble with a record of one win and seven losses, therefore a record of 25-47 for the season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When the season paused, the Wizards were one of the teams that mathematically had a chance of clinching the eighth playoff seed in the Eastern Conference. However, actually doing so would have been magical for the team due to its lackluster defense and injury problems. Washington’s </span><a href="https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/defensive-efficiency" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">defensive efficiency</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is 1.120, second to last in the league.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even though the defense was miserable and held the team back, the Wizards didn't play badly offensively. Washington usually stayed in the game and consistently put up points. That is a good takeaway for a rebuilding team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Head coach Scott Brooks was without his three best players. Guard Bradley Beal and all-star point guard John Wall were both sidelined with injuries. Center Davis Bertans opted out due to COVID-19 concerns. The absence of Wall, Beal and Bertans gave young players such as Rui Hachimura and Thomas Bryant more professional experience. Bryant averaged 18.9 points per game in the bubble and took a </span><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/wizards-nba-bubble-awards-thomas-185643944.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">major step forward</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> by showing he is capable of being a long term starter for the Wizards. </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/nbcsports/rui-hachimura-out-for-wizards-season-finale-bringing-his-strong-rookie-year-to-a-close/2389952/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Hachimura</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> ranked sixth in scoring and third in rebounds among rookies this season, proving himself to be a reliable player in the lineup moving forward.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32919"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since the Wizards are a rebuilding franchise, missing out on the playoffs was acceptable. It is probably for the better so the team can stock up on draft picks, unless the very unlikely possibility of signing a player of the caliber of soon-to-be free agent Anthony Davis becomes a reality. That would be a massive boost for the Wizards, but the team is not in the right position to </span><a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/nba-free-agents-2020-ranking-top-10-players-who-could-be-available#slide-13" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">pry Davis away</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> from the contending Los Angeles Lakers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What mattered about the time in the bubble was not making the playoffs, but rather assessing what the Wizards currently have and what they need to improve upon. The biggest red flag is the defense, but the offense looks good.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">General manager Tommy Shepherd is only a year into his new position, so it will take some more time until he shows if he is the correct person for the job. It would be wise of him to extend Davis Bertans' contract immediately, as it just expired. He should also load up on defensive prospects in the draft.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Shepherd and Washington’s major wildcard is whether or not John Wall will be as good as he was before </span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/wizards-john-wall-has-high-hopes-for-return-from-injury-im-gonna-be-better-than-what-i-was-before/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">tearing his achilles tendon</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in December 2018 and then slipping at his home and re-injuring it afterwards during rehab.

If Wall does not return as the same player at some point next season, the Wizards will be stuck with a bad contract for a few more years. That would likely hinder the process of becoming a contending team because they probably won't have enough money to keep the promising talent they currently possess.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Banking on the prospects Shepherd selects in the draft to continuously deliver without acquiring other big players isn't reliable.&nbsp;Determining whether or not he is the right person for the job is already difficult enough, but for all anyone knows, he might be the answer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For now, the Washington Wizards have a promising young group of offensive players and a big question mark hanging over the franchise and fanbase’s heads, but after years of mediocrity and an elimination from playoff contention, there could be magic in store for the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	32919

33117	The issue with mass stockpiling	<p>Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many have found themselves struggling to get by. Small businesses are hustling to keep themselves afloat, school districts are scurrying to create successful online learning systems, and medical staffers are working excruciatingly long hours to help those in need.</p><p>To lessen the spread of the virus and its chaos, state governors have urged citizens to stay home by enforcing stringent stay-at-home orders––some states even administering fines for non-essential travel. This has led many Americans to stockpile on everyday items. People are hoarding exorbitant amounts of items—from rolls of toilet paper to cases of water—just so they can be prepared. While this reaction is understandable, stockpiling is doing more harm than good.</p><p>When customers stockpile superfluous amounts of items, grocery store chains are forced to place a limit on the number of items people can purchase because they are unable to accommodate the growth in consumer demand. This further feeds into the chaos, as the rarity—and thus, demand—of desired items increases.</p><p>Junior Kasey Thorpe mentioned her experience at Giant, where various items had limits placed on them. “I remember in the candy aisle you could only get like two to three bags of candy. When I was going to go get shampoo, you could only get either one [bottle] of shampoo [from one brand], one [bottle] of conditioner [from one brand], or you [could] get both [from the same brand],” Thorpe said.</p><p>This can harm those who need more than one item for specific reasons—like family size—because due to hoarding, they are now restricted to certain amounts.</p><p>In addition to limiting items, stores are limiting their hours and how many customers are allowed inside the store at the same time due to excessive stockpiling. Abha Bhattarai, a writer for <em>The Washington Post,</em> reported that places like Walmart, Kroger, and Dollar General have started to shorten store hours so employees have enough time to restock and disinfect the space. Costco, and many other food chains, even put a restriction on how many customers were allowed into the store at any given time. This can be detrimental to those who are in desperate need of items but are unable to buy them due for a variety of reasons, such as transportation or money issues.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33116"></div><p>These hoarding limits have a disproportionate impact on lower-income families. According to Abby Vesoulis, a writer for <em>TIME, </em>a 2019 Federal Reserve study found that 40 percent of Americans could not come up with $400 in order to support themselves during an emergency. Those same people end up going out to earn money, ultimately putting themselves and other people at risk. Additionally, people seeking funds have to consider limitations on items and the unpredictable changes in store hours, just to acquire what they need.&nbsp;</p><p>A prime example are those who depend on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), known colloquially as food stamps. Food stamps are given out every month at a fixed amount that is based on a family’s gross monthly income, net income, and assets. However, the time between these monthly distributions can seem like forever. For instance, a family of four that depends on food stamps is allowed to purchase any quantity of item needed as long as it is within the benefits. However, if food chains have limited the quantity of food items, that family is forced to buy—for instance—one loaf of bread instead of two, which may not be enough to feed their family. This is just one way that the effects of excessive stockpiling can be detrimental to families in need.&nbsp;</p><p>Hoarding makes it harder for elderly groups to get grocery items as well. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), those who are 65 years and older are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, making interactions dangerous. When limits on grocery store items are placed and goods are available in lesser quantities, elderly groups are forced to either spend more time in stores than they would otherwise need to, risking their lives, to get groceries or to find others—like family members or neighbors—who can help them.&nbsp;</p><p>Organizations like Feeding America, No Kid Hungry, and Meals on Wheels are a few of many programs helping get food to communities in need. Junior Molly Merlocoyne mentioned that she volunteered for Meals on Wheels a few times, which helps deliver meals to home-bound people who may not be able to cook or shop for themselves.</p><p>“A lot of people are older and… have mobility issues or lower income[s], so they can't necessarily get to the store or buy things; and a lot of them can't cook for themselves” Merlocoyne said. “So, we provide a cold and… hot meal—Monday through Friday—to ease their worries about food insecurity.”</p><p>However, not every elderly person has access to programs, family members, or neighbors that are willing to help them out. This makes it especially hard as they are left to either risk their lives to get what they need, or struggle on their own. This challenge is exacerbated when there are fewer products available on the shelves.</p><p>Hoarding may appear to be a reasonable reaction to a dire situation; however, people must realize that the price of their preparation may be someone else’s suffering. Instead of senselessly hoarding items, think about what is truly necessary while considering those who are unable to get anything they please.</p>	33116
33090	Blazers fearlessly explore new hairdos (and don'ts) while quarantining	<p>Bangs, buzz cuts, and bleach. Without barbers, Blazers are taking the scissors into their own hands by styling their own hair. Some run the two-guard over their scalps to liberate themselves from the inconvenience of their long locks, while others dye their hair dramatic colors to test out unique styles in a rare time where they don't have to worry about negative judgment.</p><p>Junior Judy Goldstein dyed her hair purple at home after her family did the same. “I didn’t want to be like every other girl that dyes their hair in quarantine, but then my sister dyed her hair purple… Just because my little sister dyes her hair doesn't mean I'm going to. But then my mom, who is an attorney, and forty or whatever, dyed her hair, too,” she says. “Then I was like, ‘Well, okay.’</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33088"></div><p>Styling her own hair was easier than Goldstein expected. “It really wasn't that difficult. I've seen TikToks of people doing it by themselves,” she says. “It’s really grown on me.”</p><p>At the end of the day, though, it was not as serious as Goldstein anticipated it would be. “I think before I did it, I thought it would be a really big deal, but I think it hasn't really been,” she says. “It's just been something minimal to control what I can control.”</p><p>Senior Jennifer Ren is a little more used to taking control of her hair. “I already cut my own hair,” she says. “I'm too broke to go to a barber… The only time I've been to a barber was in China, and they messed up my hair pretty badly. It did not look good; it was really uneven.”</p><p>However, in quarantine, peer pressure factored into her decision to get bangs in a spur-of-the-moment decision. “My friend, Emmy, got bangs, and then she was like, ‘You should get bangs, too,’” she says. “I thought, ‘why not.’”</p><p>But Ren is not pleased with how her bangs turned out, as her rushed decision became more and more abysmal as she put more work into it. “I cut my hair about four times,” she says. “The first time I cut it, it was long, then I needed to trim it. I cut it again so it was shorter, but then it still looked really bad, then I tried to fix it. Every time I tried to fix it, it got worse. Eventually I just stopped.”</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33089"></div><p>To make matters worse, Ren’s new bangs also bother her throughout the day. “It's really annoying having hair in my face,” she adds. “Every day I just take bobby pins and clip them up. I'm just waiting for them to grow out.”</p><p>However, there are still positives to glean from the experience for Ren. “It kind of serves a purpose: Now I know bangs are not the look for me,” she says. “There aren't really any negative consequences because we are in quarantine, so no one is going to see me for at least a month.”</p><p>Reflecting on her decision, she has some advice to give to potential hair-transformers. “Go for it,” she says. “If it looks bad, then it's fine, you're not going to see anyone for a while. But then if it looks good, you can replicate it again after quarantine… Just go for all your dumb hair decisions. Don't think about it too much.”</p>	33088

33034	Hogan's proposed highway expansions could cut into Blair's athletic fields	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Governor Larry Hogan’s controversial highway expansion plan, which includes adding four toll lanes to Interstate Highways 270 and 495, will, if enacted, cut into Blair’s athletic fields and affect the entire capital suburban community.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The project spans more than 70 miles––from south of George Washington Memorial Parkway on I-495 in Virginia, to west of Maryland’s Exit 5 on I-495, and north into Frederick County on I-270. First proposed by Hogan in September of 2017, the project has three phases representing distinct sections of the interstate highways.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Currently Phase 1, the portion from the American Legion Bridge to Frederick along I-270, which would not directly affect Blair, is pending approval for construction. This phase will accept written comments until Nov. 9. After Phase 1 is built, Phase 2 will be proposed for construction, which includes the portion of I-495 that runs alongside Blair.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maryland’s Department of Transportation (MDOT) compared multiple proposals, including Alternative 10, the design that Hogan favors. Alternative 10 adds four Express Toll Lanes (ETLs) on I-270 and I-495 while maintaining the existing High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes on I-270. The Alternative 10 proposal gained traction following congestion studies conducted by the MDOT in 2018, which show it maximizes congestion relief compared to other road alternatives. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As currently proposed, Alternative 10 would reconstruct the highway noise barriers to cut slightly into Blair’s athletic fields. In addition to causing space constraints, the new noise barriers would not fully curb the noise of traffic from the expanded 12-lane highway.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33032"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Increased traffic flow would also create additional air pollution and carbon emissions, which poses additional problems for the Blair community. Ross Capon, the president emeritus of the Rail Passengers Association, explained that carbon emissions from cars impede youth development. “[There is a] biological impact of higher carbon dioxide concentrations on the functioning of the human brain,” Capon said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is supported by a study published by the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, which studied brain function at varying concentrations of carbon dioxide. The study found a 21 percent decrease in the average cognitive scores of participants for every 440 particles per million (ppm) increase of carbon dioxide.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair community would also be burdened by increased traffic flow while entering and exiting the expanded highway, making the area increasingly dangerous for pedestrians.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The current cost estimate for the entire project is $11 billion; the plan is to subsidize between $484 million and $1 billion from taxpayers. The original proposal included no direct taxpayer subsidy.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Furthermore, this price tag does not consider the cost for sewer and pipe relocation, which the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC) estimated to be $2 billion, including an estimated 277 percent increase in water bills. This is approximately up to $2,200 per year for a family of three in Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The total $11 billion cost would be funded by a private company through a Public-Private Partnership (P3), a system in which private funds are used in exchange for toll revenues.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, P3s often fail to provide these purported savings to taxpayers. Ben Ross, the chair of the Maryland Transit Opportunities Coalition, looked back at similar partnerships and described the disadvantage of P3 programs. One example is the Purple Line, a new Metro spanning 16 miles and connecting Bethesda with New Carrollton.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“We are seeing the weaknesses of the [P3] model right now with the Purple Line,” he said. “[The government has] a history of losing money but the people who make the deals clean up and walk away.” Currently, construction of the Purple Line is stalled and will not be completed without significant taxpayer funding.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Four companies are competing to be the private partner of the expansion. The Maryland Board of Public Works (BPW) is scheduled to announce the winning company for Phase 1 in May 2021. Transurban is projected to win as they built the toll lanes on the Virginia portion of the Beltway and Hogan’s former Chief of Intergovernmental Relations now works for the company.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Proponents of the project believe that the expansion of these major highways is necessary to improve the regional standard of living and stimulate economic growth by enhancing the reliability of commute time. According to the Managed Lanes Study published by the MDOT, average congestion per day is seven hours on I-270 and 10 hours on I-495. Alternative 10 expects a decrease in daily delays of 35 percent.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Opponents feel that the plan would be environmentally unsustainable, as there are no comprehensive stormwater drainage plans and more than 1,500 acres of forest spanning 47 local parks would be cut down. In addition, 34 homes would be acquired by the state, cutting into neighborhoods and forcing families to move further away from major roadways. Such action would lead to longer commutes and more reliance on cars.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The P3 system requires toll lanes to make a profit, which Capon believes would create a tiered system on the highway unfairly excluding and discriminating against poorer citizens. “It’s more likely to look like the Virginia beltway where, during rush hour, you can pay $30 to $40 to ride the toll lanes,” he said. “That’s why some people call them ‘luxury lanes.’”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Opponents also insist that instead of spending billions on cars and highways, greater emphasis should be put on public transit.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">All alternatives proposed by the MDOT specifically excluded transit options such as the Purple Line, Bus Rapid Transit routes, and Ride on Metro busses, according to Jane Lyons, the Maryland Advocacy Manager for Coalition for Smarter Growth.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lyons believes the proposed solution is not representative of current knowledge about transportation. “The alternatives that [the state] looked at are things you would look at in the 1950s,” she said.“What we want them to look at is more of a modern 21st century approach to transportation.”</span></p>	33033

The runner-up was TylerThe Creator with just under six percent. Honorable mentions go to Kanye West and Taylor Swift.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Top Song of 2019: "Sunflower" by Rex Orange County</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers listened to a great variety of songs this year.

Her new playlist is a blend of songs that she hears and likes, regardless of artist or genre, whereas her throwback playlist has more generic Top 40 pop songs. "I'll go back to my old playlist that I had, and I'll just jam out to some old Selena Gomez from like 2008," Haverland says.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Top Artist of the Decade: BTS</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">BTS was the top artist of the decade as well as the top artist of the year with just over eight percent of the responses. Drake and Taylor Swift tied for runner-up, and honorable mentions go to Twenty One Pilots and XXXTENTACION.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Che Moorhead sees similar changes in his taste over the past ten years. "Six-year-old Che loved pop music. Taylor Swift was one of his favorite artists," he says. Since then, he's gotten more into other genres like hip hop and discovered a deeper passion for rap. He also notes that his music taste has become more culturally diverse. "I've definitely exposed myself to a lot more multicultural genres," he says, "I've gotten a lot more into bossa nova and a lot of types of jazz, I like artists in languages I don't understand, like I love Latin trap music," he says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This multicultural music taste is reflected in some of Blair's favorite songs and artists, seeing as many of the survey results, for both 2019 and the decade, were from countries all over the world and in languages other than English.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Top Genres of the Decade</strong></p><ol><li>Pop</li><li>Rap</li><li>Pop Rap</li><li>Hip Hop Rap</li><li>(tie) Rock and K-Pop</li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There was not much change between the 2019 and decade results for genre, although pop was somehow even more popular throughout the decade among Blair students than it already was just for 2019.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This past decade of music was full of new artists, styles, and even genres, like memerap, and with the introduction of new music streaming services, such as Soundcloud, it became even easier for artists to gain attention. These apps also helped students' tastes to evolve by making a diverse range of music more accessible to listeners worldwide. In the next decade, music will continue to diversify and become even more accessible as new artists take the stage and old ones retire.</span></p><p><br></p>	32486
33610	The Blazers take home their second win of the season in 3-0 game against the Blake Bengals	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following their first win last week, the Blair varsity girls' volleyball team (2-3) dominated the Blake Bengals in a 3-0 game. With a showing of aces and kills by players throughout, Blair secured the win in only three sets.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first set began with multiple aces by junior Celine Wu, giving Blair a lead over Blake. While the Blazers' made numerous powerful hits that landed out, their aces and kills (serves and hits that immediately scored a point) allowed them to keep their lead. Blake's coach, in an attempt to hinder the Blazers' momentum, called two timeouts in the set. Nevertheless, the Blazers charged forward and went on to win the set 25-18.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers continued their momentum from the first set into the second. The Blazers tried to exploit holes in Blake's defense to increase the lead, but the Bengals pulled even as Blair consistently hit out. In an intense rally close to set point, the crowd was on its feet as Blake hit the ball out. With a final hit by junior Brooklyn Prince, Blair won the set 25-20.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With only one set left to win the game, the third set once again started out with an ace by junior setter Celine Wu. Still, the Bengals fought hard to try to even out the score. After Blair pulled ahead 20-14, Blake’s coach called a final time-out. Blake's coach called a final time-out after Blair scored four consecutive points (20-14).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nonetheless, with coordination from all members of the team, the Blazers continued to score and won the final set 25-18, leaving the crowd cheering in the stands.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Setter junior Rosie Orzulak comments that there were a lot of nice plays in the game. "A lot of our serves were super-duper good, and our swings were so good. Everyone was fully swinging, everyone was giving it their all. We were running a lot of plays that we just learned in practice so being able to actually execute it during the game was really fun, " Orzulak said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, Oct. 1 against Sherwood at 4:45 p.m.</em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Editor's Note: Celine Wu is a staff writer for Silver Chips Online.</em></p>	33609
32094	The Blazers remain undefeated in conference play	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair boys' soccer team (5-3) took down the Kennedy Cavaliers (3-5-1) by a score of 3-2 on Oct. 2. This win lifts Blair's conference record to 3-0 after defeating Paint Branch and Springbrook in September.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Both teams struggled offensively in the first half, with few shots on goal and lots of great defensive play. Just 14 minutes into the first half, senior defender Silas Reitsma received a ball and chipped it over Kennedy's goalkeeper to put Blair up by one. Blair's defense, led by senior goalkeeper Brennan Moore, was able to keep Kennedy without the ball in the first half.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32093"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The second half was a different story. Kennedy's offense came out swinging and immediately tied the score. Soon, Kennedy played a ball ahead of the Blazers' defense and scored again, giving the Cavaliers a 2-1 lead. With 13 minutes remaining in the game, sophomore forward Alexander Hernandez was fouled in the penalty box, giving the Blazers a penalty kick that senior midfielder Walter Sosa capitalized on to tie the game at 2-2. Just six minutes later, a shot from Reitsma was saved, but senior forward Natinael Tesfaw grabbed the rebound and tapped it in to give Blair the lead with seven minutes left and ultimately win the match. "It always feels good, especially if it's a winner," Tesfaw said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After giving up two goals and taking the lead, the Blazers' defense didn't allow a single shot on goal from the Cavaliers, and secured the win. "I felt like it was lockdown after those two goals. We [the defense] realized our problems and we resolved it. We realized what we did wrong and we didn't allow them to capitalize on their shots or on their counterattacks," junior defender Liben Schmidt said.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers play their next home game against the Northwood Gladiators on Oct. 10 at 5:30 p.m.</em></p>	32093
31610	Postsecondary institutions should make test score submissions optional	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Teacher recommendations, essays, transcripts, standardized test scores —&nbsp;all of these have long been part of the college application process around the United States. But while the first three allow schools to get a taste of an applicant's academic abilities and personality, the last one doesn't indicate much except a student's test-taking skills and relative privilege. For institutions of higher education to truly show that they want prospective students to be well-rounded rather than simply talented at testing, they need to stop requiring submission of SAT or other standardized test scores during the application process. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The SAT itself does not measure much more than students' capability to bubble in answers. First given to a group of about 8,000 high schoolers in 1926, it was originally called the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Developers of the test meant to measure the testers' </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sats/test/what.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">innate ability</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to perform well, emphasizing natural talent and inclination over learned material. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although the original name was dropped and the acronym now doesn't stand for anything, there's a consensus from experts that the test fails to accurately reflect academic ability or potential for success. "The nature of standardized exams — fast-paced, multiple-choice 'games' that put a premium on strategic guessing — means that they advantage students with strong test-taking skills, not necessarily those with other talents that may be more valuable in the classroom or in life," Bob Schaeffer, public education director of the National Center for Fair &amp; Open Testing, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/04/22/what-does-the-sat-measure-aptitude-achievement-anything/?utm_term=.0356717b99fd" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">said</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. He later added that SAT advocates do not consider students' ability to expand their knowledge of various subjects after taking the test. Senior Rafeal Girma agreed that a student's performance on the SAT largely depends on their skill at the time. "I think it really depends on the student —&nbsp;some students are bad test-takers. But there's also tips and tricks that you can use to get better, which really helped me," he said.&nbsp;﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31609"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">But there are clear links between an individual's socio-economic status and their performance on the SAT, meaning that succeeding on the test can be difficult for students who don't have access to the "tips and tricks" that Girma mentioned. The College Board's </span><a href="http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/research/2013/TotalGroup-2013.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">own data</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> shows a correlation between higher family income and higher overall scores on the test. The key to succeeding on most standardized tests is a very specific type of preparation often gained through pricey boot-camps, tutors and textbooks. Thus, teenagers whose families who earn less money and don't have hundreds of dollars to invest in those materials face a disadvantage when it comes to actually taking the test. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Racial disparities in test results are evident as well. The history of the SAT is </span><a href="http://www.nea.org/home/73288.htm" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">rooted in racism</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">; the earliest model was used to place World War I soldiers in segregated units. Score information released by the College Board </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/09/27/scores-new-sat-show-large-gaps-race-and-ethnicity" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">shows</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that there are noticeable differences between different racial groups' SAT results. During the 2016-2017 school year, during which the newest version of the SAT was given, 71 percent and 59 percent of Asian and white students respectively received benchmark scores on both the verbal and math sections, while only 31 percent of Latino students and 20 percent of black students got benchmark scores.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Considering the fact that testing skills usually begin to be taught at an early age, when schools with heavy Latino and black populations are not </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/why-poor-schools-cant-win-at-standardized-testing/374287/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">provided</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> with the same resources as primarily white and Asian schools, the fairness of the SAT as an ability indicator should be questioned. Pinning a student's college admission largely on whether they have the privilege to put time and money into test prep, as well as if they are provided with equitable resources by society, is a practice that needs to be eliminated.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Another issue that arises is the cost of sending scores to colleges. There is currently a $12 fee per score report per college, which can add up quickly for those who don't qualify for fee waivers, as well as those who do qualify but plan to send scores to more than the free eight colleges that waivers guarantee. Girma was one student who expressed annoyance with the submission cost. "I don't see why you have to spend [$12] for each school, because it adds up — with the application fee and everything, it's just a lot of money to spend per school," he said. Although anyone who registers for the SAT automatically receives four free score reports, those reports have to be sent to schools before the student actually sees their SAT score, making them seemingly pointless. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Those who argue that dropping standardized test requirements is not logistically possible or will hinder colleges from seeing students' prospects can look to the </span><a href="http://www.fairtest.org/university/optional" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">1000-plus</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> accredited, successful schools that are already test-optional. A recent </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/04/27/large-study-finds-colleges-go-test-optional-become-more-diverse-and-maintain" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">study</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, conducted in part by a former Dean of Admissions for Bates College, found a correlation between "test-flexible" policies and increased numbers of Latino and black students who applied and were admitted to the schools in question. The study also confirmed that people who didn't submit standardized-test scores had equal or higher graduation rates when compared with those who did submit scores. Countless prestigious schools have seen positive results such as diversification from abandoning score requirements, making it clear that switching to a test-optional system is the right answer for all higher education institutions. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Standardized tests like the SAT are a very narrow measure of students' talents. They mostly rely on a person's natural test-taking skill and access to resources, ignoring their creativity, potential to grow, effort and other valuable factors. To become more fair and remove the longstanding societal emphasis on numbers, colleges need to make it optional to submit test scores when applying.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31609
33040	Unpacking the SRO program	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Community leaders, such as Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando and former MCPS Student Member of the Board (SMOB) Nate Tinbite, have called for the reduction or elimination of the School Resource Officer (SRO) program, which installs Montgomery County police officers in county high schools.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The main objection to the program is due to disproportionate arrest rates for some racial groups.

They also revealed that Black and Hispanic students combined received roughly 80 percent of all suspensions, though Black and Hispanic students make up just 46.8 percent of MCPS’s total student population.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Officer Sharese Junious, who was the SRO assigned to Montgomery Blair High School for five years until receiving a promotion in 2020, thinks that the SRO program plays an important role in schools, according to an interview with Silver Chips in February. “My job is acting as a liaison between the police department and the school,” Junious said, “and basically making sure that the school has any law enforcement it needs.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">SROs’ duties, according to the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/pol/bureaus/patrol-services.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">website</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, also include emergency preparedness and safety education, crisis management, assisting with traffic and law enforcement within the school, and helping deliver MCP programs within schools. Such programs include topics like conflict resolution, crime and gang prevention, and drug and alcohol awareness.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junious believes that the role of the program has been misconstrued by some. “A lot of people are under the assumption that we go to school and we just lock up kids all day, and that couldn’t be further from the truth,” she said. “We really do value the relationships that we build with the students and the staff, and it has nothing to do with us wanting to arrest kids.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But Montgomery County Councilmember Will Jawando doubts the merits of the program and is calling for its elimination. According to Jawando, the program is partly to blame for the disproportionate arrest rates of Black and Hispanic students. Jawando thinks the resources expended on the program would be better spent elsewhere.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“We spend 3 million dollars on our police budget, which is the purview of the County Council, to support the SRO program,” Jawando said. “At the same time, we have one of the worst student to nurse ratios in the region,...

33337	A deep dive into the songs, the artists, and all of the in-betweens.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">January brought the music industry three exciting new song releases from up and coming artists. With featured singles from three young actors/actresses and singer/songwriters taking center stage in the pop music scene right now, let’s take a look at how their new releases compare.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Jan. 8, 17-year-old actress and singer/songwriter Olivia Rodrigo released her debut single, “drivers license” through a partnership with Geffen Records. Shortly after, 21-year-old actress and singer/songwriter Sabrina Carpenter released her song “Skin” on Jan. 22. Between these two releases, 20-year-old fellow actor and singer/songwriter Joshua Bassett released his new single “Lie Lie Lie” on Jan. 14.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“drivers license” is an emotional tribute to lost love, broken promises, insecurity, and conveys a deeper sense of sadness that listeners can relate to. With a minimal guitar and piano background, Rodrigo soars through her vocal range, from quiet ballad-like verses to a belted chorus and bridge. The song incorporates the typical features of sad pop (simple backgrounds, soft lyrics and emotional choruses) but Rodrigo’s voice adds a special element of grief that strikes deeper. Her voice shifts seamlessly between the almost-shaky introduction into an intense climax, all without feeling out of place.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9513123/olivia-rodrigo-interview-drivers-license-geffen-feature/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">As Rodrigo described in an interview with Billboard</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, “drivers license” is “[her] deepest insecurities in a four-minute song.” In the days after its release, “drivers license” </span><a href="https://headlineplanet.com/home/2021/01/09/olivia-rodrigos-drivers-license-earns-1-on-real-time-us-apple-music-chart/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">spiked to the #1 spot on Apple Music’s Top 100</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and has stayed there since, and </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/15/entertainment/olivia-rodrigo-drivers-license-spotify-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">also set a new Spotify record for most streams in a day of a non-holiday song</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. The song has also gained popularity on social media app TikTok, where fans have made parodies from different perspectives (i.e. the “blonde girl,” the boy she is singing to, and even </span><a href="https://youtu.be/34ty_ELBtrE?t=10" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">the driver’s license itself</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">).&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33335"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While “drivers license” is Rodrigo’s debut single, it’s not the first time she’s worked with music and songwriting. </span><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/why-olivia-rodrigos-song-drivers-license-went-viral-on-tiktok-a-timeline-1492591/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">She had previously written “All I Want” back in 2019</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for the soundtrack of </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">High School Musical: The Musical: The Series </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">(HSMTMTS), in which she stars as the female lead. Fans have surmised that “drivers license” is a heartbreak song about Joshua Bassett, who played the male lead in HSMTMTS, and that the “blonde girl” mentioned in the song refers to Sabrina Carpenter, who Bassett is rumored to be in a relationship with. However, this remains unconfirmed by all parties involved, despite heavy speculation from fans.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, while “drivers license” is passionate and heartfelt, Sabrina Carpenter’s single “Skin” from Jan. 22 is more detached and relaxed, sticking to Carpenter’s typical pop-esque beats and chorus style. In places where “drivers license” is passionate, “Skin” is easy-going and loose, with a message of letting go instead of zoning in on sorrow or heartbreak. Carpenter’s vocals remain steady and sure, with very little of the sudden vocal changes that we hear in “drivers license.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite many fans speculating that “Skin” was a song released in retaliation toward “drivers license,” Carpenter clarified that this was not the case in a </span><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/sabrina-carpenter-addresses-speculation-that-skin-is-about-olivia-rodrigo" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">recent Instagram post</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. She expressed that the song is not meant to be aimed at anyone in particular, rather being a song about personal strength and growth. “[I] wasn’t bothered by a few lines in a (magnificent) song and wrote a diss track about it. [I] was at a tipping point in my life for countless reasons. [So I] was inspired to do what [I] usually do to cope, write something that [I] wish [I] could have told myself in the past,” Carpenter wrote.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the other hand, Joshua Bassett’s release “Lie Lie Lie” which came out Jan. 14 is far more hard-hitting than “drivers license” and “Skin,” with an intense guitar background and fast-paced singing. The lyrics are harsher than both of the other songs, filled with accusations and angst. While “drivers license” and “Skin” cover the emotional and relaxed facets of pop music, “Lie Lie Lie” spans across its more direct and angrier tones.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While many were taken aback and assumed “Lie Lie Lie” was about Rodrigo, this is unlikely, since the song was </span><a href="https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/joshua-bassett-lie-lie-lie-lyrics-olivia-rodrigo/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">first written back in November 2019</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and demoed on Bassett’s Instagram page. Instead, the song seems to be more generally about betrayed friendships and trust, rather than an angry diss track that many have believed it to be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the drama and rumors that might surround Rodrigo, Carpenter and Bassett, there’s no doubt that all three are talented and passionate about their work. While fans may continue speculating about their personal lives (even theorizing that the timing of the releases and the well-crafted lyrics were part of a joint publicity stunt), all three artists are busy working on their next&nbsp;projects, which we excitedly await.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33335
33042	Liberal justice passes away shortly before the presidential election	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sept. 18, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died of pancreatic cancer at age 87 at her home in Washington, D.C. She served as one of the nine justices on the U.S. Supreme Court for more than 27 years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ginsburg was nominated to the nation’s highest court by President Bill Clinton in 1993. She made history as the first Jewish woman––and only the second woman––ever to sit on the court when she was confirmed later that year by the U.S. Senate with a 96-to-three vote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the days following Ginsburg’s death, Blair senior Abby Kusmin took command of organizing a community vigil at the Red Brick Courthouse in Rockville. Kusmin, a leader of Sunrise Silver Spring––a local chapter of the national climate justice organization Sunrise Movement––said that the Sept. 23 event aimed to inspire youth to respond to Ginsburg’s passing by taking action instead of mourning. “I hope [it was a way] to get people to take action at that moment and realize [not to just say], ‘Oh, let's be sad, mad and hopeless,’” she said. “I hope it was kind of an impetus.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout her tenure on the court, many recognized Ginsburg as a feminist icon. She fought for gender equality, reproductive rights, and other liberal policies that altered the course of American jurisprudence.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33041"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In 1996, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">United States v. Virginia</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, ruling that the male-only admission policy at the Virginia Military Institute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. “Generalizations about ‘the way women are,’ estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description,” she wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">English teacher Beth Hanak believes that this ruling has helped make America a more equitable place. “School should reflect the public it serves. [A] school that only admits men does not do that,” she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ginsburg’s legacy as a progressive justice extends farther than women’s rights. In 2015, Ginsburg also helped lead the court in a landmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Molly Howard, who is bisexual, remembered the day the ruling was issued and described the impact it had on her life. “It was a really important day for me,” Howard said. “[I knew] no matter who I ended up with, no matter what I decided to identify as, I would be able to marry whoever I wanted.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ginsburg, however, wasn’t a hero to all. In June, she sided with the conservative wing of the court in a 7-2 decision ruling to uphold the construction of a natural gas pipeline that would run underneath the Appalachian Trail and encroach the National Park Service’s ownership of the area. In 2016, Ginsburg also criticized NFL players for kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sept. 26, President Donald Trump nominated conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the vacant seat on the court. Barrett was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit by Trump in 2017 and attracted support from social conservatives because of her strict interpretation of the Constitution.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If Barrett is confirmed, the court will have a strong six-to-three conservative majority, which has left many worrying that liberal decisions that Ginsburg was a part of––including same-sex marriage and upholding the right to an abortion––could be overturned.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a federal judge, Barrett has ruled on two abortion cases, both times favoring the restriction of access to an abortion. In </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in 2019, the Seventh Circuit voted to overturn an Indiana law that would require minors seeking an abortion to have parental consent––effectively expanding abortion rights. Barrett joined the dissent and said that the law should have been allowed to take effect.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair senior Abbas Islaw believes that Trump’s nomination of Barrett just one week after Ginsburg’s death was inappropriate and unfair. “I thought it was personally pretty disrespectful. He didn’t have to go through with [Ginsburg’s] last wish, but he completely disregarded it,” Abbas said, referencing a note Ginsburg wrote in her final days stating, “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Like Islaw, senior Bamlak Fekade, is disappointed that partisanship has taken over one of the most important judicial processes in the country. “It’s kind of sad that [political parties] have control over Supreme Court nominations… people will vote for [candidates] whether they have an ‘R’ next to their name or a ‘D’ next to their name,” he said. “Political alignment diminishes what democracy was meant to be.”</span></p>	33041
33046	Heated negotiations lead to months of delay	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Aug. 28, the Montgomery County Board of Education (BOE) and the Montgomery County Education Association (MCEA) jointly filed a formal notice of impasse with the Maryland Public Schools Labor Relations Board (PSLRB).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The filing marked the first time in over twenty years that the two sides were not able to reach a contract agreement before the existing one expired. The two sides have since started a mediation process, as outlined in the current contract.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For almost a year, the BOE and the MCEA have been unable to find consensus on a labor contract, which would apply to the more than 14,000 MCEA members who work as teachers, counselors, and other staff in MCPS.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The current contract was set to expire on June 30, but the day before it expired, the BOE extended the contract to July 31 to allow more time for negotiation. On Aug. 6, after the July deadline passed without settling on a new contract, the BOE formally extended the previous contract indefinitely until a new contract is adopted.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In early October, MCPS and the MCEA agreed on a mediator, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Joshua Javits, who will work with both parties to resolve the remaining areas of disagreement in contract negotiations. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If the sides fail to find a solution during mediation, the PSLRB has the ultimate authority to choose the final contract out of three proposed drafts from the MCEA, the BOE, and Javits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The BOE has declined to comment throughout the contract negotiations and resulting impasse. David Stein, a Blair math teacher and member of the MCEA bargaining committee, said that before the impasse was confirmed in August by the PSLRB, members of the MCEA could only talk privately amongst themselves. But since the impasse was declared on Aug. 28, Stein has had the freedom to speak publicly about the negotiations.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33045"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In an Oct. 5 blog post, the MCEA outlined the issues that, in their mind, have caused the stalemate. “[The] MCEA continues to stand firm for individual control of planning time, transparency in school resource allocations and environmental concerns, and greater emphasis on ensuring equity for our students as well as issues related to wages in year two of the contract,” they wrote. The union had previously published a list of 21 points of disagreement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As part of addressing the equity issues for students, the MCEA wants to incorporate language regarding the school-to-prison pipeline into the contract. Stein explained the importance of incorporating this idea: “[The school-to-prison pipeline is] a well-researched phenomenon in our schools where the atmosphere in schools... ends up doing nothing for certain students but putting them on a path for prison.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Stein highlighted this as an equity concern. “Those students [being put on a path toward prison] are disproportionately Black and Brown students… but the school district refuses to use those words in our contract,” he said. According to Stein, the BOE referred to the phrase school to prison pipeline as “too jargony.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The BOE and MCEA have had issues working together in the past, including some other instances of enlisting outside assistance. After the MCEA proposed the use of an “interest-based bargaining process” in 1998, the BOE and the MCEA hired Conflict Management Inc. to mediate negotiations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For the current contract negotiations however, the MCEA did not use “interest-based bargaining,” instead returning to a more formal route of trading contracts back and forth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Stein explained how, this year, the MCEA allowed open bargaining so that MCEA members—not just those on the committee—could observe the negotiations. “Our members could come to the bargaining sessions and see what's happening,” he said. “We never did that before.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The BOE announced in September that they are hiring controversial attorney Ron Taylor of Venable LLP to represent them during the upcoming impasse proceedings. Taylor has a record of anti-union sentiments. The MCEA has questioned the expense and possible bias of this outside counsel. </span></p>	33045
33180	One group has consistently failed to show up on Election Day to vote: young people. Junior Asher Lavovich plans to change that by registering Blair students to vote.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEvery four years, large swaths of the nation come together to cast their ballots and pick their leaders in a great ritual of democracy. But one group has consistently failed to show up on Election Day: young people.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33178"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tJunior Asher Labovich knows that young people can make a difference at the polls and wants to help increase the youth vote. As the election approaches, he only has one thing in mind: registering Blair students to vote. “Voting is one of the most important things I think we can do as a society and to… make the world a better place.” he says. “Especially this year, with the importance of the election.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWhen Labovich and a team of seven other students first started registering voters last November, they were planning to register every eligible voter at Blair. But his original plans were upended by COVID-19. “It's much, much more difficult [to register students now],” he explains. “Without COVID, we could go to teachers specifically, and ask, ‘Hey, could you give out this link in your class?’ but it's hard to do [that] with [COVID] because there's no… physical contact."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHowever, Labovich has not been deterred from his goal and remains committed to registering as many students as he can. “We're mostly just getting people to talk to people in their inner circle… and [teaching] them how to [register others],” he explains. "Now we're moving on to the teachers… [and asking] them to put up links.” By reaching students through both methods, Labovich hopes to register up to 50 new voters.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLabovich has changes he’d like to see made at the state and national level to make voting easier. He supports automatic voter registration as well as several other measures. “I think you need automatic or mail-in voting for pretty much every state,” he says. “Remove voter ID laws… that just makes it harder for people to vote for absolutely no reason.” Labovich also highlighted one popular proposal for increasing voter turnout: making Election Day a holiday and forcing employers to give employees the day off to vote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLabovich wants to see a large youth turnout next month, but he pointed to two major factors that are working against turning out the youth vote: busy schedules and apathy. “Voting is oftentimes fairly difficult… if you're working and you're older and you've got a job, it's harder to vote on Election Day because a lot of the time they don't give you the day off.” he adds. “It's also just the ambivalence in voting because I know even I felt this quite a lot. The hope is not [there] as much as it could be in politics.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEven though one vote may seem mathematically insignificant, Labovich urges students to cast their votes. “[Your vote] can make it better for a lot of people,” he says, “so it's important to vote whether or not it makes it perfect.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair students can learn more about how to register to vote at </span><a href="https://mocoto100.carrd.co/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://mocoto100.carrd.co/</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.&nbsp;</span></p>	33178
33052	Meet the candidates and issues on this year's ballot	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Nov. 3, the Montgomery County electorate will cast votes in a variety of important local races ranging from the Board of Education (BOE) to the Circuit Court.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33049"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><u>BOE At-Large</u></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery County residents will vote for one candidate to fill the BOE At-Large seat. The two candidates running are Lynne Harris and Sunil Dasgupta. Harris, an educator and former President of the Montgomery County Council of PTAs (MCCPTA), believes that her background as a nurse and current teacher in the Academy of Health Sciences at Thomas Edison High School will be critical in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her number one priority is bringing the student voice to the center of all MCPS decisions. Dasgupta has also been involved with the MCCPTA and is a political science professor at the Universities at Shady Grove where the majority of his students are MCPS graduates. He wants to invest in the mental health of students and staff. Dasgupta has been endorsed by the Montgomery County Education Association, the local teachers’ union, and the Montgomery County Public Schools Retirees Association.Harris was endorsed by The Washington Post and local youth groups. The Silver Chips Editorial Board also endorsed Harris this past spring. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Read personal columns from both candidates on page B5.</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33050"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><u>BOE Districts 2 and 4</u></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are two additional BOE races occurring in Districts 2 and 4. Residents of District 2 will vote between incumbent Rebecca Smondrowski and challenger Michael Fryar. Before serving on the board, Smondrowski was a mother of MCPS students and a legislative aide in Annapolis. Moving forward, Smondrowski aims to develop a more diverse and qualified staff and use performance data to learn about student achievement and accordingly determine where resources are most needed. Fryar is putting his experience as an educator, social worker, and lawyer at the center of his campaign. He wants to expand magnet programs, career specific schooling, and early education, and would like MCPS to utilize school choice rather than redistricting in regards to boundary changes. Smondrowski has been an advocate for keeping students at their neighborhood schools.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many Blair families reside in District 4, where current BOE President Shebra Evans is running for reelection against Steve Solomon. In addition to her work on the BOE, Evans serves on the Board of Directors of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education. If reelected, she plans to continue working to close the achievement and opportunity gaps. Solomon, her opponent, had a career in radio and began to become&nbsp;involved in local politics over the last several years, including an unsuccessful campaign for County Council in 2018. He hopes to expand career and technical training within schools and keep students at their neighborhood schools.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><u>Montgomery County Circuit Court</u></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Citizens can also vote for four people to serve on the Montgomery County Circuit Court. There are five candidates on the ballot, including four judges who currently serve on the court: Bibi Berry, David Boynton, Christopher Fogleman and Michael McAuliffe. All four went through a rigorous judicial nominating process before being appointed to their current seats by the governor. The only challenger to the sitting judges on the ballot is Marylin Pierre, a lawyer and veteran who pledges to practice restorative justice through more equitable sentencing. Pierre has not gone through the same vetting process as the other candidates.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33051"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><u>Ballot measures</u></strong></p><p>I<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">n addition to voting for candidates to represent them, Montgomery County residents will vote on several ballot measures that will inform important decisions at both the state and county level. Question 1 and 2 are statewide measures. Question 1 proposes a state constitutional amendment that would give more budgetary control to the Maryland General Assembly. The passage of Question 2 would allow the General Assembly to pass laws allowing the expansion of commercial gaming in order to raise education revenue.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Questions A, B, C, and D pertain to Montgomery County specifically. Question A would amend the County Charter to cap the property tax rate instead of the total property tax revenue. Councilmember Andrew Friedson, the author of Question A, notes that the measure would simplify Montgomery County’s current tax policy and “create a clear, consistent and straightforward policy.” Question B is in direct opposition to Question A and would amend the County Charter to prohibit increased revenue collection from the property tax.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery Neighbors Against Question B, chaired by former BOE member Jill Ortman-Fouse and lawyer William Roberts, is trying to educate citizens on why to vote against Question B. “[Question B] prohibits the County Council from increasing the total revenue received from the property tax beyond the rate of inflation under any circumstance,” explained Ortman-Fouse. “This is really problematic because not only are we in an emergency situation now, we may be in other emergency situations in the future.” Roberts encourages citizens to do thorough research on the ballot measures before casting their votes. “Take it seriously,” he said. “Take a beat and understand the implications.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Questions C and D pertain to the makeup of the County Council. Question C proposes expanding the council to 11 members and adding two more districts, reducing the size of the already existing districts. If passed, Question D would divide the county into nine districts and eliminate at-large seats so that each citizen is only voting for one councilmember.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">An analysis of all four Montgomery County ballot measures is on page A4.</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><u>Takoma Park Mayor</u></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On a more local scale, residents of Takoma Park will have the opportunity to vote between two candidates to be their mayor. Current mayor and Blair parent Kate Stewart is running for reelection against Roger Schlegel, a high school teacher at the Maret School in Washington, D.C., who is active in Takoma Park politics.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Stewart’s vision to make Takoma Park more accessible to everyone attracted senior Dana Graham to the campaign. “[Takoma Park is] so inaccessible, particularly for immigrants and people of color,” Graham, who is Stewart’s campaign manager, said. “What really drew me to Kate was her progressive policies, particularly in housing.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Several other Blair students work on Mayor Stewart’s campaign, including senior Xander Toti who is the team's graphic designer. He believes Stewart is the best candidate because of her previous work in Takoma Park politics. “She has a lot of experience, both as mayor and just in local government,” Toti said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some Blair students, like junior Elisabeth Desmond, are supporters of Schlegel. “</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">I was drawn by Roger's outreach to young voters,” she said. “He seems in touch with the people that he talks to.” Desmond has been helping Schlegel’s campaign by designing flyers and spreading information about his campaign on social media.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: transparent;">While they support different candidates, Graham, Toti, and Desmond all agree that people should pay more attention to local politics. “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Local politics is the most important branch of government because at the end of the day, these are the [people] that are paving the roads and building your libraries,” Graham said. “[They’re] making your life on an everyday tiny scale better or worse.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33053"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><u>How to register</u></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The general period for registering to vote ends 21 days before the election (Oct. 13). For those who missed this window, however, registration will still be available in person during early voting or on election day. Residents will need to bring proof of address, which could be a driver's license from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Association, an state identification card, a bank statement, a utility bill, or any document that has their current address and name.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><u>How to vote</u></strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Voters can request a mail-in ballot by texting “VOTE” or “vbm” to 77788, visiting elections.maryland.gov, or completing the paper application. All eligible Maryland voters received an application for a mail-in ballot in late August or early September; this is due back to the local board of elections by Oct. 20. Those planning to mail their applications should leave at least five business days for the United States Postal Service (USPS) to deliver them; those using the online system must complete their applications by 11:59 p.m. on Oct. 20.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The application is not what will be used to vote. A resident will receive their official ballot after completing and submitting their application. The ballots must be placed in a designated drop box or postmarked by 8:00 p.m. on Nov. 3. The USPS recommends, however, that voters mail their ballots at least a week before election day to ensure that it is counted.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When filling out the ballot, it is important to follow all directions as any mistakes can lead to the ballot being rejected.

32023	The school building underwent planned changes this summer	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The 2019-2020 school year marks the 20th anniversary of Blair’s Four Corners campus as well as a much larger incoming student body. Renovations in the building concluded in the week of Aug. 29 to prepare the school for the year. The renovations included gym and auditorium floor replacements, new furnishings for portables and classrooms, a new chemistry lab and new recreational and instructional spaces.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32021"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The process of replacing the floors in the gym and auditorium began two years ago when Blair's administration decided they needed repairs by the time the school building entered its third decade. These repairs included a brighter red, more reflective of Blair’s school colors, for the gym floor, along with new carpeting and non-scratch flooring for Alumni Hall, the auditorium.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Administration also decided to merge rooms 315 and 317 into a chemistry lab this summer. The new lab is necessary to accommodate the increased number of students taking chemistry as the student population continues to expand.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“A year ago we had 3200 students, and this year we are expecting upwards of 3400. We had to plan to accommodate them,” principal Renay Johnson said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Instructional and lounging spaces replaced hallway lockers on the second and third floors of the building for students and staff to utilize during school. These spaces were also an attempt to reduce the crowd sitting around the first-floor hallways during this year's one-lunch period.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32022"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To help reduce the crowd for buying food in the cafeteria during the one lunch period, administration introduced “food kiosks” in strategic areas on the second and third floors and transformed the senior courtyard into a “Senior Cafe.” Administration deemed the labeled areas as “much needed” to help the building thrive throughout the year.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“People like new things, and this year I feel that morale and school spirit will be up,” Johnson said in response to how she expects students to react to the changes. She hopes that Blazers’ overall satisfaction with Blair will increase in response to these changes aimed at modernizing the learning environment for students and staff. “It is our goal to help evolve 21st-century learning,” Johnson said.&nbsp;</span></p>	32022
32628	The luncheon coincided with the Lunar New Year, resulting in festive celebration	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As Blazers squeezed through the cafeteria-side doors after school on Jan. 24, the last day of the first semester, they were greeted by a significantly different sight than the usual — an extraordinarily long line of eager teachers and tables of steaming, aromatic food.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the past, the Blair Magnet program has hosted luncheons for Magnet staff twice per year. However, this year principal Renay Johnson suggested that they expand the luncheon to show appreciation for the entire staff, as Magnet students greatly benefit from non-Magnet resources in their world language, humanities and physical education classes. "In past years, Magnet families have been very generous in putting on a lunch for Magnet teachers," Johnson said. "They would invite other teachers, but other teachers didn't feel like it was for them."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32626"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Parent Teacher Student Association (PTSA) has hosted teacher luncheons in the past, but PTSA Staff Appreciation Committee Chair Diane Kelleher appreciated this year's funding from the Magnet Foundation and the contributions of Magnet parent volunteers that brought the unique event to fruition. "It's really generous of the Magnet Foundation to cut a big check to cover the bulk of the catering order, and teachers particularly like it when parents bring homemade dishes," Kelleher said. She noted that the food itself distinguished this luncheon from past events, with a wider diversity of food and international dishes.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since the end of the semester coincided with Lunar New Year's Eve, Magnet parent volunteers enthusiastically delivered, filling tables with homemade stir-fry rice noodles, green scallion steam buns, mung bean cakes and more. Dumplings, a culinary staple for New Year's celebrations, covered the tables as well. An entire table was dedicated to rice cakes, a signature food during the Lunar New Year. In Chinese wordplay, the phonetically identical characters for "rice cakes" also signify reaching new heights with every year.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Magnet parent liaison June Zhou explained that the parents' enthusiasm arises from a respect for teachers that is deeply rooted in Asian culture. "Teachers are the most respected job because they raise the future generation that society depends on," Zhou said. "We appreciate this opportunity because Magnet students benefit from the whole school's staff."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Zhou was thankful for the opportunity to foster more understanding between groups in such a diverse society. "We don't want to just celebrate our own culture," Zhou said. "We want to build a bridge between Eastern and Western culture so people can understand each other better."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Magnet parent Zhen Yuan prepared tea and a poster for the traditional tea table at the event. On the poster, Yuan chose two Chinese idioms to represent the parents’ motivation behind organizing the luncheon. "I spent half a day preparing the poster and deciding what to display," she said. "If you only know Chinese food, you don't get a deep look into the values we've had for thousands of years." "良师益友" roughly translates to the idea that a good teacher also serves as a helpful friend, while "一日为师终身为父" translates to the idea that being a teacher for just one day earns someone the respect of a lifetime mentor.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32627"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Parents decked out the cafeteria with red lanterns, a customary Lunar New Year decoration, and contributed trinkets and emblems of Chinese culture for teachers to take home, including gold-plated bookmarks, intricate paper cuttings and traditional embroidered coasters.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Zhou said the Magnet parents started preparing for the luncheon three weeks before the event itself. Many Magnet parents prepared food far in advance. Parent Bin Chen worked on her dish—signature spring rolls made from scratch—from dawn until she arrived at Blair. "I forgot one ingredient, so I had to run into the store at 6:40 a.m. after dropping my daughter off at the bus stop," Chen said. "I was preparing the ingredients, making each spring roll, and frying them from 7 to 11 a.m."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite her frantic morning, Chen said her contribution was worth the hassle. "Making something homemade instead of buying something from the store is my way to say thanks," she said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The teachers said the luncheon made for a delightful end-of-semester celebration. Music director Michelle Roberts was surprised because she expected only catered food. "This is awesome," Roberts said. "They sent us an email saying there was going to be chicken, but we didn't know there would be all this other tremendous food here."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Special education department teacher Amy Parrish appreciated the effort that went into setting up the tea table and hoped future luncheons will bring culture to the forefront as well. "It was a nice personal touch to give us a little something more than just food," she said. "It would be great if other luncheons incorporated other cultures as well—it's fun and enriches us."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">English teacher Anne Rubinovitz noted the luncheon created a great impression of the school's environment, especially because as a first-year teacher at Blair. "I sense that our PTSA really cares and that the teachers and parents can all come together and celebrate at the end of the semester," Rubinovitz said. "It's a very warm feeling."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Johnson said she was extremely satisfied with how the idea turned out, from the Magnet program's reaction to the final product. "The parents were great," she said. "They brought in food so the whole staff that touches Magnet kids can benefit from the luncheon, and the quality of food is above my wildest expectation."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Johnson said she wanted future Magnet staff luncheons to include all teachers from Blair's 316-count staff. "I hope that we can still get parents to support the idea that Magnet students don't just belong to Magnet teachers—they belong to the whole Montgomery Blair," she said. "I hope this first-time luncheon can be a tradition here.</span></p>	32626
32773	The COVID-19 crisis threatens to wipe out our community’s safety net.	<p>Like thousands of your constituents, I remember my first day of swim lessons at the YMCA. As I left my grandfather’s grip and waded into the freezing-cold water, two hands gripping the tile sides of the pool, I began to cry. I felt like I would never learn to swim. But learn I did, and, although I am close to 18 now, I still consider myself a perpetual Y-Kid.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the Y’s swim programs, I found confidence in water and discovered a lifelong, lifesaving skill. Through the Y’s Youth &amp; Government program, I serve as Youth Governor of Maryland and find inspiration to enter public service at every program event. Through the Y’s diabetes prevention programming, I know I’ll find hope as the son and grandson of diabetics. But the COVID-19 crisis threatens to topple the charity cornerstones of my life and our community.&nbsp;</p><p>The complete shutdown in economic activity over the next weeks will prevent many organizations, including my own Youth &amp; Government program, from hosting the events they need to maintain revenue streams and program funding. An inevitable economic downturn will force many Americans to cut their charitable giving for the year short: punching charities in the gut when their services are needed most.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32772"></div><p>However, there is another staggering economic dimension to the challenge facing our charities. Payrolls in the independent sector are larger than those even in the construction, finance, and transportation industries. Nonprofits like the Y employ more than 12 million people who compose the fabric of their communities. Millions of livelihoods are now at risk of dying out.&nbsp;</p><p>Sooner than later, 44,504 people in just Montgomery County could lose their jobs. Maryland’s Eighth Congressional District might find itself bereft of A Wider Circle, which provides homegoods, counseling, and antipoverty education to families in need. It is horrifying to imagine what the Montgomery Blair High School community would look like without the youth and family services provided by the Silver Spring Y or the lifesaving generosity of Manna Food Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Representative Raskin, I implore you. Just as you have stood up for your constituents and defended the common good on countless other occasions, fight the good fight now. The nationwide nonprofit community has recently released a request for Congress to allocate $60 billion in relief for nonprofits on the frontlines of the Battle Against Coronavirus. My fellow constituents and I humbly ask that you advocate to your colleagues for this relief and help ensure that any stimulus package relieving corporations decimated by the current crisis also relieves the nonprofits whose work is so vitally important.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember nonprofits when it comes time to vote, your help will not be forgotten by me and by thousands of your constituents.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	32772
32431	Older generations have been mocking younger generations for years. Fast forward to 2019 and young people have clapped back with the term “OK Boomer.”	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Older generations have been mocking younger generations for years. We’ve all heard our grandparents complain, “kids these days” or “when I was your age…” Back then, kids never had a ready response. Fast forward to 2019 and young people have clapped back with the term “OK Boomer.” The joke hasn’t been taken lightly. Boomers have characterized the term as discriminatory, specifically, it has been described as “ageist.” To describe the term as ageist belittles the experience of people who face actual systemic oppression. And honestly Boomers, it’s just a meme.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In case anyone forgot, let's define a few things. “Boomer” is short for “Baby Boomer” which is a label for people born right after World War II. There was a huge spike in birth rates after the war because, well, the men came back. The meme “OK Boomer” originated from a video of an unidentified older man, claiming that </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">millennials</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Generation Z</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> have the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_syndrome" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Peter Pan syndrome</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, they don't ever want to grow up.” The term is used to call out older generations’ ignorance when it comes to current issues, such as climate change and LGBTQ issues.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition, the term “OK Boomer” is a response to the ways Boomers treat younger generations. Boomers frequently make comments that suggest that they are wiser and more knowledgeable than younger generations. For Millennials and Gen Zers, “OK Boomer” is their objection to being patronized. It’s a way of fighting back from the older generation’s dismissive and mocking comments. The term reflects how things have changed, and how older people are being held accountable for their failure to appreciate that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Instead of appreciating the meme as a joke, Boomers have become defensive and pulled the “respect your elders” card. They claim that the term is ageist and offensive, so much so that it has been banned from some work environments. According to </span><a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/ok-boomer-not-okay-office" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">the National Law Review, </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;the Age Dicrimination in Employment Act makes age a protected category. Under this Act, comments like “OK Boomer” can be interpreted as discriminatory and derogatory. It is worth noting that this Act does not cover people under the age of 40, suggesting that age related comments directed towards younger people are not similarly protected .&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Millennials have been contending with jokes aimed at them from the moment they were deemed “Millennials.” Whether it's a comment about being spoiled or living off of avocado toast, Millennials heard it all. They take a different approach by making Boomer criticism into jokes and memes.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32430"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In Millennials efforts to respond to Boomer ignorance, they have been characterized as ageist. The notion of ageism, like sexism and racism, implies an oppressor and their ability to interfere with someone's well being. Young people do not have the capacity to oppress older people because they are not positioned to actively oppress Boomers. </span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">“OK, Millennia</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">ls. But we’re the people that actually have the money,” says senior vice president of AARP Myrna Blyth according to</span><span style="color: rgb(74, 134, 232); background-color: transparent;"> </span><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/aarp-exec-ok-millennials-were-the-people-that-actually-have-the-money-2019-11-13" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(74, 134, 232); background-color: transparent;">MarketWatch</a><span style="color: rgb(74, 134, 232); background-color: transparent;">. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Note that this is the </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">single</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> instance in which Boomers take Millennials seriously. The power dynamic will always be in Boomer’s favor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Boomers, younger generations aren’t trying to oppress you. After all, they are actually very progressive in that department. They are trying to defend themselves and call out ignorance when they see it. Instead of feeling disrespected, take “Ok Boomer” as a wake up call. Understand that younger generations are painfully aware of social justice issues and environmental issues. Boomers, who were a big part of the social justice movements of the 60s, should recognize the campaign for equality millennials are advocating for.&nbsp;It’s time to move on from the generational gap and realize that everyone is fighting for the same cause. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32430
33093	Blair students give back to community during COVID-19 pandemic	<p>Carrying plastic bags filled to the brim with groceries, a teen volunteer dons protective equipment to drop off groceries at the front door of a neighbor’s house. As a member of “Teens Helping Seniors,” the volunteer is delivering groceries and other essentials to the homes of the elderly and immunocompromised.</p><p>Teens Helping Seniors was started by two Blair sophomores, Matthew Casertano and Dhruv Pai. The pair began delivering groceries to their grandparents during the ongoing pandemic, which prompted them to create their service. “This organization started unofficially at the start of March,” Casertano says. “[We] both wanted to help our grandparents.”</p><p>Casertano and Pai soon realized that seniors, highly at-risk for COVID-19, may have trouble accessing groceries if they are alone. “We sort of thought, ‘What about people who maybe don't have family nearby to help them out? How are they going to get their groceries and their medication without having to expose themselves to the virus?’” Casertano says.</p><p>The service mobilizes teens to buy groceries and other needed items for vulnerable seniors. “Crossing that generational gap and that age barrier has been one of the fundamental aspects of why this is so rewarding and why we get so much impact out of such an effort,” Pai says.</p><p>“The goal of our organization is to connect teen volunteers to elderly people and immunocompromised people to allow them to stay at home and minimize their exposure to the virus,” Casertano adds.</p><p>Senior Lintaro Donovan, Vice President of Outreach for the service, elaborates on the struggles facing the quarantined at-risk population regarding food security for themselves and family. “There are people who are vulnerable to COVID-19 who are being forced inside their homes because of circumstances outside of their control,” he says. “Contactless deliveries are an incredible and direct way of solving a lot of those issues.”</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33091"></div><p>In the first few days of the service, the main priority was growing their volunteer base. “At the very beginning, we mostly focused on getting volunteers,” Casertano says, “so we could get a solid foundation of people who can do deliveries.”</p><p>After building their steady volunteer base, the service started delivering to seniors and the immunocompromised in Montgomery County. Before each delivery, they make sure to reiterate safety procedures. “We have a big list of procedures that everyone has to follow because that's the most important thing in our organization,” Casertano says. “If we mess up on that, it defeats the whole purpose.”</p><p>These precautions include wearing a mask and gloves, maintaining six feet social distancing protocols, using alcohol disinfectants, and having no contact with the seniors.&nbsp;</p><p>With these precautions in mind, the team of volunteers began their deliveries and in doing so, made—and continue to make—an impact in the community. “Most seniors are just blown away that we are doing something like this,” Donovan says. He notes the service has gotten praise through emails from across America.&nbsp;</p><p>What started out as a few deliveries in the first few weeks quickly grew to over 250 deliveries in Montgomery County alone. Since then, the service gained traction and recognition. “I recently just got done working with a British film studio to make a Snapchat episode about the organization,” Donovan says.</p><p>The organization has emphasized outreach to ensure communities in need are aware of its services. “We have been reaching out to communities across the United States who could potentially stand to benefit the most,” Pai says, “mobilizing through emails, listservs, social media, reaching out to news organizations.” The service also has information for seniors and teens alike on their website: teenshelpingseniors.org.</p><p>The recognition of the service has helped increase the number of volunteers and has encouraged others to start up their own chapters of the service. “After we got some national press attention, we got requests from people all across the country and even in Canada, who want to help Teens Helping Seniors chapters in their area,” Casertano says.</p><p>With over 200 volunteers, the service spans across the United States. “We have 11 chapters and two more in Canada,” Pai says, “and they are spread out across more than seven different states.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the service has many partners. They work with Serving Together, which is a veteran organization, and Blair Kindness Corner, which helps low income families. They also partnered with Girl Scouts of America to provide the scouts volunteer opportunities to earn badges and Founding Farmers, an organization that resells foods not used in restaurants at affordable prices.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33092"></div><p>As more and more volunteers and partners get involved around the world, seeing the impact has been gratifying for those involved. “I personally feel really good about the impact we are making because over two hundred deliveries means over two hundred instances where we kept a senior away from a virus that has a very high probability of killing them,” Casertano says.</p><p>Pai shares that their service highlights the good teens can do. “One of the biggest things for me was noticing that a lot of media press and what we are saying in the news right now has a decidedly negative portrayal of teens,” he says. “We have been showing the world that teens are not necessarily just not caring about the crisis and that there are still some teens that truly care for their community and are willing to work hard.”</p>	33092
33236	MCPS announced that a missing work grade will change to a 50 percent	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Dec. 9, the MCPS Board of Education announced changes to the second semester curriculum in order to address the high failure rate due to virtual learning. A list of these changes can be found </span><a href="https://news.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/quicknotes/curriculum-and-instruction-adjustments-for-the-second-marking-period-and-beyond-2/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> and includes a reduction in the number of graded assignments as well as a change to the way that missing assignments will be graded. Instead of a Z (representing a zero), MCPS changed it to a 50 percent for missing assignments unless there is sufficient communication with the parents about the assignment. While the hope is that this new policy will prevent students from failing too many classes, some have concerns about potential problems that could arise.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This decision is slightly controversial, with teachers and students both worried about the potential downsides. Freshman Mekides Dixon shared some concerns that the new policy might not push students to do the work in the first place. “I understand that since it's 50 percent, they might think it’ll help their grade, but in the end, do they even deserve to have that 50 percent if they aren’t doing the work?” Dixon said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With a less severe penalty given to students who do not turn in work, Dixon believed there is less motivation, as missing an assignment or two might not affect grades as much. Dixon said that this could lead to less understanding of the actual material, as homework is generally necessary for students to actually understand the lessons.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, there is the concern of the change in grades not actually helping students in the long run. Science teacher Leslie Blaha worried that the new grading policy won’t solve the real problems at the root of students failing. “It fixes the wrong problem. It doesn’t fix any of the problems… First quarter grades were bad for various reasons, but MCPS’s fix for this was to give more students 50 percent on their work,” Blaha said. Blaha believes that by boosting grades, MCPS would fix the surface-level issue of low grades temporarily, but fail to address the issues that might cause failing grades in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Online learning was a huge change for most teachers and students, leading to many struggles.The change in grading policy, no matter how well it actually works out, was started due to a startling trend in grades over the first quarter. The Washington Post reported on the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/montgomery-county-failing-grades/2020/12/03/913affd0-34fb-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">increase in failing grades</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> in MCPS, stating, for example, that “more than 36 percent of ninth-graders from low income families failed the first marking period in English. That compares with fewer than 6 percent last year.” Given these concerning statistics, MCPS’s response is understandable, and it remains to be seen the effect that the new grading policy will have.</span></p>	32878

These virtual ceremonies allow for at-risk family members and friends to watch the couple exchange vows and share stories while also getting the chance to share a toast or wish the couple well in a way that’s more meaningful than over text or email. For these virtual weddings, those looking to make the celebration extra special have even found ways to deliver a special meal from their caterer to their guest’s houses.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDespite many of the ceremony modifications available now, some just don’t feel satisfied holding a gathering during such a restricted time. Many couples would rather wait to hold their weddings when they will be able to have the number of guests they want and include all their family members without potentially risking lives. This means postponing ceremonies indefinitely or pushing to a date far in the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMegan Lusby, who teaches Geometry and AP Statistics at Blair, had to do just that. “I have two grandparents [that] we wanted to be there, as well as some older aunts and uncles who are very important to us,” she noted. “We knew they wouldn't be able to make it had we held our wedding on the original date.” Her ceremony was pushed an entire year forward to May of 2021, and she hopes that she can hold the wedding how they had originally planned.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWedding vendors, photographers, and planners have all faced their own challenges in providing their services this season. Carrie Coleman, a local photographer based in the DC area, has shot less than half the weddings she typically does in a year. She also has not been able to shake hands with and hug clients during their ceremony takes somewhat of a toll on her business. “So much of what I do is people-driven and all about connection,” she wrote in an email. “It's definitely not easy… to be hidden behind a mask the whole day.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tColeman has incorporated mask shots into her photos for couples who want to show what a unique and crazy time they got married in. She has also had to figure out how to capture meaningful shots while maintaining her distance from her clients. “Usually when I shoot, I get fairly close to my clients, but I have had to adjust that this year,” she said. “It's important to me that my clients feel like I have their best interest in mind and that I protect myself while shooting.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tNo matter how couples’ plans have changed for their weddings this year, it is heartwarming to see people find creative and safe ways to celebrate their love. Coleman sums this up best, saying, “From elopements by waterfalls with just a bride and groom, to a small 16 person dinner in someone's backyard— events this year look a lot different, but… the beauty of them has only increased.”</span></p>	33183
32929	The Disney+ original full of heart tells the inspiring story of a real circus gorilla	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to hinder the typical movie experience, families are looking for a new way to enjoy a premier from their own homes, and many production companies are finding new ways to make this possible. One of these films, released at home on Disney+ for audiences to access, is </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The One and Only Ivan.</em></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32928"></div><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film is based on the best selling novel by Katherine Applegate, and inspired by the true story of a gorilla that learned to paint. It follows Ivan (Sam Rockwell), a silverback gorilla with more to him than what meets the eye. As Ivan learns to paint and draw, he realizes he no longer enjoys performing at the dying circus where he lives in captivity, or living inside a cage instead of out in the wild. The other circus animals who perform alongside him are in agreement, and together they decide they want to escape.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The circus features an older, wise elephant Stella (Angelina Jolie) who acts as a mother figure to the animals. She is joined by a young elephant Ruby (Brooklynn Prince) who Ivan decides deserves a better life than his where he has been trapped inside for nearly thirty years. Additionally, a stray dog voiced by Danny Devito adds a comedic flare to the film. </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The One and Only Ivan </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">features a long list of impressive names including Hellen Mirren as a poodle, Chaka Khan as a chicken, and </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Hamilton</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">’s Philipa Soo as a squawking parrot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The One and Only Ivan </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">combines CGI animation along with live acting. Compared to full animation, where the film would feel less realistic, CGI allows for the animals to feel and look real alongside the live actors. Even though Rockwell is not able to portray emotion through his face due to the CGI, he brings lots of emotion to Ivan through his voice. Breakout star Brooklynn Prince (</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Florida Project</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">) shows her ability to portray a wide range of emotion through the voice of Stella as well.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film portrays the captivity of circus animals as not black and white, but more nuanced, something that is not often seen in movies surrounding animal captivity. The animals aren’t always upset about performing in the circus, and have a mostly positive outlook on their lives. Additionally, there is no clear villain in the film. Even the somewhat greedy circus’ ringleader Mack (Brian Cranston), who holds the animals captive and forces them to perform, isn’t portrayed as evil. Cranston brings this depth and complexity to his character throughout the film. Director Thea Sharrok shows that Mack does care about the animals, though he does not always make the best decisions when it comes to how he treats the animals. He forces young elephant Ruby to learn tricks, and doesn’t call the vet for an injured Stella even though he promises he will.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The line “not all humans are bad” is repeated throughout the film, furthering this message. The animals resent their lives of captivity, but not their leader, who keeps them in their cages. The film shows how one can show empathy towards anyone, and kindness can be found in everyone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This strong message, in addition to the somewhat overplayed storylines that can be found in many Disney films, shows that this is not one of the many new releases geared towards an older audience. The film has a strong emotional pull and a few comedic moments to make viewers laugh throughout the film, but there is no real depth. Although the sometimes predictable storylines and lack of any twists or real surprises might not resonate with older audiences, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The One and Only Ivan </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">is a great movie to watch and enjoy alongside a younger sibling or as a family.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The One and Only Ivan is rated PG and is available on Disney+.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32928
31729	Kaywin Feldman will begin the job after a long history of museum leadership	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Running between appointments, Kaywin Feldman's schedule is packed, but she still has a calm, cheerful demeanor as she goes about her day. She even finds time to greet museum visitors and ask them about their favorite exhibits. As a former Blair student and Montgomery County resident, as well as the current director of the Minneapolis Institute of Art (nicknamed Mia), Feldman has connections across the country. In a few days, she will be leaving her post in Minnesota and returning to the D.C. area to step into a renowned position. Starting March 11, she will be known as the first woman to head the National Gallery of Art. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Feldman's passion for art blossomed at a young age. In addition to growing up in Europe and learning about Roman architecture and art from her dad, her teenage years in Maryland influenced her. "I went to Takoma Park Junior High School and my French teacher took us to the National Gallery every year to look at French paintings, so I definitely have to give her some credit," she says. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although she was always interested in art history, Feldman didn't plan to pursue it as a career until she went to college. At the University of Michigan, she took a Greek archaeology class for fun and enjoyed it so much she decided to change her major from political science to classic archaeology. After obtaining a master's degree from the University of London's Institute of Archaeology, she entered the professional art world with little experience but much enthusiasm. Feldman eventually went from curator to director at the Fresno Metropolitan Museum of Art and later, directed the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the seemingly smooth start to her career, Feldman faced some tough challenges. "It's certainly been difficult [holding these positions]," she explains. "I was often dismissed because I looked young." Although she faced difficult situations in Fresno and Memphis, she says both experiences allowed her to learn more about art and its impact on communities, a subject that is important to her. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Feldman applied those very lessons to her most recent position as director at Mia. Since she began in 2008, she has been credited with doubling attendance and incorporating technology into many of the museum's exhibits. "[At Mia], we actively expanded the way we offer technology to visitors," she explains. From placing iPads with extra information in most galleries to helping develop an escape room app for museum attendees, Feldman "experimented with different things" and spearheaded several efforts to make Mia more interactive. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Beyond her involvement with technology, Feldman's favorite part of working at Mia is simply watching visitors enjoy art and seeing how it moves different people. "It's really about the individual impact it has on people. I love seeing members of the community come look at our art," she remarks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Feldman is also a strong social justice advocate and has been praised for including themes of activism in exhibits across all the museums she has directed. One of the "most important projects" she worked on at Mia, she says, was an exhibit honoring Philando Castile, a 32-year-old black man who was shot and killed by a Minnesota police officer in 2016. "[Castile's] mother contacted us, and she had all these pieces sent to her from various artists after the tragedy," Feldman says. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31727"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The works, which came together in a collection called "Art and Healing," were displayed at Mia in June and July 2018 as a collaboration between Castile's family and the museum. "The theme was really about love and the need to remember life," Feldman explains. "It was incredibly touching." </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A </span><a href="https://aamd.org/for-the-media/press-release/joint-study-from-aamd-and-smus-national-center-for-arts-research-on" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">study</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> published by the </span><span style="color: rgb(35, 31, 32);">Association of Art Museum Directors in 2017 revealed that nationwide, women hold less than 50 percent of museum directorships, and those that do earn less than their male counterparts. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the first woman to be the director of the National Gallery in a field with unfortunate amounts of gender disparity, Feldman wants to "pave the way for others." </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">She is incredibly proud of the barrier she is breaking and looks forward to continuing to apply her skills and interests to the next step of her career. Through her position, she hopes to inspire other women to embrace similar interests and increase the amount of women in national leadership roles. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Feldman's focus on communication and community has been central to her vision for her upcoming position. Since she was elected as director by the National Gallery's Board of Trustees in December 2018, she has been eager to learn about the museum as a whole. "My job is to really understand the mission and the values… I'm excited to think about what it means to be a national museum and what we can do with other institutions," she explains. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">She is also thrilled about working with the renowned collection of art at the gallery, as well as about meeting her colleagues. "I'm looking forward to getting to know the staff —&nbsp;it'll be an honor to work with them," she says. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Feldman's strong background in art history and leadership are central to her personal experience, which will only grow as she takes on this challenging yet inspiring position. As a woman breaking barriers on the national stage, she is admired by many and will surely continue to be applauded as she brings her creative ideas to the National Gallery of Art. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31728
32598	The boys' team won the Boardwalk Classic and the girls' team won the Dave Griffith Memorial Shootout Tournament over winter break	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Dec. 29, Blair's boys' varsity basketball team (10-3) won the Jay Craven Bracket at the Boardwalk Classic in Wildwood, N.J. On Dec. 27, Blair's girls' varsity basketball team (11-2) won the Dave Griffith Memorial Shootout Tournament.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For the boys, they defeated Shawnee High School and St. Joe's by the Sea High School en route to the tournament win, their first since 2014. Although it was exciting to win, the team remembered to stay humble, as much of the season remains. "I just told the team to stay humble... I will be happy when we win a state title," junior guard Alfred Worrell said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The trip to New Jersey helped the boys' team grow a greater team chemistry, as they spent time not only on the court, but also off the court. "Spending time in our hotel rooms, the jacuzzi, and also being together on the court together helped us build a brotherhood deeper than basketball," junior guard Roman Cannuscio said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Looking towards the rest of the season, the boys need to focus on the central theme of trust. "Trusting each other and playing fast, I feel like if we do that, no one can beat us," Worrell said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The girls' team echoed a similar feeling from their tournament, that it helped bring them together as a team, as well as a chance for everyone to get good playing time. "Winter tournaments are always important for our team because they bring us together more. It was also a chance for those who get less play time in the regular season to get on-court experience," Martin said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Martin, junior guard Kate Hildebrandt and freshman Natalie Frost were awarded all-tournament-team honors. Martin was also awarded the tournament's most valuable player. "Really what I try to be is a leader on the court and do what my team needs me to do, often that's a lot of defense and rebounding," Martin said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition, the tournament acted as a great boost for the team. "To win the tournament was such a great confidence boost for the whole team, creating good momentum for future games," Hildebrandt said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Both teams look to carry over last season's playoff success. The girls have some tough games ahead against Sherwood and Churchill. The boys will also face some tough teams at the end of the season, with Sherwood, Churchill and Blake being the biggest challenges.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The girls' next home game is on Jan. 28 against the Sherwood Warriors at 7:15 p.m. The boys' next home game is on Jan. 24 against the Northwood Gladiators at 7:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32597
32744	Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announces the first confirmed cases of the disease in Maryland.	<p>Maryland Governor Larry Hogan announced the first three confirmed cases of coronavirus in Maryland. In a press conference late Thursday, March 5, Hogan stated that all three patients reside in Montgomery County and are quarantined in their homes despite being in good condition. While the identities of the three people were not shared, it is known that the cases include a couple in their 70s and another individual in their 50s. Hogan also declared a state of emergency for Maryland in order to increase funding for the Department of Health.</p><p>The three patients were all recently outside of the country on the same group trip and returned to Maryland on Feb. 20. "A specialized team of disease investigators are working in Montgomery County with these individuals. We want to understand where they went and who they interacted with during the period of time when they returned from travel and when they started showing symptoms," <span style="color: rgb(67, 66, 66);">deputy secretary for public health services for the state Frances Frost said.</span></p><p>According to Hogan, local school districts have been advised to close by the Maryland Department of Education, if necessary. MCPS will hold a press conference on Friday morning to discuss their guidelines for closing schools.</p><p>UPDATE (3/5/20,10:49 p.m.): In a statement released to the MCPS community, county officials say all schools will remain open. Full statement:</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32745"></div><p>UPDATE (3/6/20, 6:35 p.m.): One patient who tested positive for coronavirus attended a public event on Feb. 29 at the Village at Rockville, a retirement community where they were in contact with 70 to 100 individuals. Gov. Hogan added, "Due to the scale of this gathering, we are urging anyone who attended the event between 12 p.m. and 6 p.m. to immediately contact their health care provider."</p><p>UPDATE (3/12/20, 6:05 p.m.): In a press conference this afternoon, Gov. Hogan and Maryland Superintendent of Schools Dr. Karen Salmon announced that Maryland schools will close from Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 27 in order to slow the spread of COVID-19 in local communities. Salmon recommended school districts to use their spring breaks as make-up days. The announcement came after a Prince George's County man tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday, making him the first known case in Maryland of community transmission. There are currently 12 people in the state who have tested positive for the virus, with 6 cases in Montgomery County.</p><p>In addition, all gatherings of more than 250 people have been prohibited and visits to hospitals will be minimized.

And they may sound extreme, and they may sound frightening.&nbsp;</span>These steps could be the difference in saving lives and keeping people safe," Hogan said.</p><p>UPDATE (3/25/20,12:01 p.m.): All Maryland public schools will be closed another four weeks through April 24. MCPS will implement a distance learning program starting March 30. Child care facilities may remain open at this time and the state is looking hard at affordable child care options for essential personnel. State Superintendent Dr. Karen Salmon said there is no certainty as to when schools will reopen. Salmon adds that the state may look into extending the school year if necessary.</p><p>Maryland currently has 2,400 available hospital beds putting them weeks ahead of schedule. In addition, Hogan is directing the Maryland Department of Health to allow medical students to staff clinics and hospitals. According to&nbsp;Mike Ricci, director of communications for the Governor, 217 of Maryland's confirmed COVID-19 cases are between the ages of 20-50. That's nearly half of the state's total cases. All Marylanders, no matter their age, should be taking this threat very seriously.</p><p><em>This is a fluid story and updates will be added when available. </em></p>	32743
33297	The Board of Education voted unanimously on Feb. 9 to start the phase-in to return to schools	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Tuesday, Feb. 9, the Montgomery County Board of Education voted unanimously to bring small groups of CTE and special education students back to in-person schooling starting on March 1. This would be followed by phasing in the entire student body on March 15. The decision followed the board's previous announcement that students wouldn't return to school until March 15.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Students have been split up into five phases, which will all be phased in throughout the months of March and April. Ideally, MCPS hopes for all students who opted in to a hybrid model to have returned to the building by April 26. Students will be further split into two groups: A and B, which will rotate going to school in person for four days every other week. Wednesday will still be a virtual asynchronous day for all students. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A link to a graphic posted by Nick Asante, the student member of the board, can be found </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLFmZkZJ_Ky/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. This graphic details which students each group includes, when the groups will be phased in, and an overview of what in-person schooling will entail.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Some students expressed concern in the comments of Asante's post that students who are going into the school building are required to arrive at 7:45 a.m. despite first period not starting until 9:00 a.m. Asante explained that this decision was made for bus scheduling reasons, so that buses still have time to drop off elementary, middle, and high school students. The extra time at the beginning of the day for in-person students will be used for academic support.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As of now, just 40 percent of MCPS students will be returning to school this spring, according to </span><a href="https://mocoshow.com/blog/when-returning-to-buildings-is-possible-60-of-mcps-students-will-remain-virtual/#:~:text=At%20the%20MCPS%20BOE%20meeting,from%2096%2C418%20parent%20preference%20surveys." target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">results</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> from the MCPS parent survey conducted in December.

32198	The College Board's new test policies inconvenience both staff and students	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The </span><a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">College Board</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> has long been criticized for being a monopoly that profits off high school students. It charges hundreds of dollars for everything from registering for tests to sending SAT scores to colleges. Just when we thought the organization could not take any more money from students, the College Board's recent changes further increase student expenses in the name of making Advanced Placement (AP) exams more accessible. In addition to a new set of online tools for teachers to distribute classroom content, the changes only complicate and burden the AP process for everyone involved.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32197"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In early 2019, the College Board announced they would be changing their AP program by moving registration deadlines to the fall. Previously, students could wait until spring to register for an AP exam. Now, the national deadline is on Nov. 15 and Blair's registration deadline is Nov. 7.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The organization announced the change after piloting fall registration in approximately 100 schools during the 2017-18 school year. The College Board </span><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/ap-2019" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">claims</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that in the pilot schools, passing scores increased by 12 percent in underrepresented minority student groups and 20 percent in low-income student groups. But it's crucial to consider that the pilot schools represent less than one percent of the some </span><a href="https://reports.collegeboard.org/ap-program-results/expanding-ap-access" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">22,612</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> schools that participate in the AP program. The results gleaned from the pilot program cannot be used to predict what will happen at every single AP school, all of which likely have different demographic makeups.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The earlier registration deadline has also left many students feeling conflicted about whether or not they should sign up for exams. Blair junior Molly Merlo-Coyne says she doesn't like the pressure to decide what her plan for AP testing is so early in the school year. "This year I'm taking harder AP classes where I don't necessarily know if I'm going to be taking the exam, and it's a lot of pressure to sign up and have to pay more to cancel them," she explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Merlo-Coyne's situation reflects exactly why the College Board's policy is flawed. Many students decide whether they want to sign up for an AP exam months into the class. With a November deadline, students must make that decision after finishing only one or two units of instruction, which are often an inaccurate reflection of the course's overall content and difficulty.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There's also the added financial burden. While the College Board's fee to register for an exam is still $93, the </span><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/ap-coordinators/exam-ordering-fees/exam-fees" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">organization has introduced two new fees</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> of $40: one for late registration and one to cancel a registration, which both apply anytime after the November deadline. A student who holds off registering until the old deadline of early March will pay $133 per exam. Though the College Board and individual schools grant fee waivers to low-income students, these expenses still add up fast.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Thelma Ibe is one of several Blazers who are disappointed in the money-sucking nature of the new policy. "To me, the policy doesn't make any sense. I didn't even know that we were going to register this soon. I don't see why we have to pay to [cancel an exam] so early," Ibe says. "I feel like they're just trying to take money from us, so that's a little bit confusing." Too many students are forced to choose between saving money and having time to make a well-informed registration decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A data </span><a href="https://www.totalregistration.net/AP-Exam-Registration-Service/Early-Registration-Reduces-Student-Success.php" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">analysis</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> by Total Registration, an exam registration service used by high schools including Blair, reveals that the College Board's portrayal of the pilot data was not reflective of the actual outcomes: there was a "33 percent increase in the number of low-income students taking the exam but only a 20 percent increase in the number of low-income students receiving a score of 3+."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even on such a small scale, early registration did not have the intended effect. To truly help increase success and retention for minority and low-income students, the College Board needs to confront the larger systemic issues of inequity that plague their organization. Fall AP registration is the organization's attempt to slap a bandaid on a bullet hole and, in the process, take money away from the very students they claim to help.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The College Board's changes, especially in regard to the new online tools, also complicate teacher duties. Blair's AP coordinator Leslie Blaha states that many AP teachers don't find the tools helpful, making them an unnecessary item to keep track of. "Most of the teachers that I have spoken to have said that the classroom tools aren't useful enough for them to use the College Board classroom," Blaha explained. "It's an added account, it's a new username and password that teachers are creating, but that nobody's using; that seems kind of pointless."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blaha's job is more convoluted than in past years due to the new policies. Previously, she only had to manage one test for each AP course. Now, because of the added classroom tool layer, she has the added burden of managing up to eight different sections for each class —&nbsp;some for teachers who choose to use the College Board's online resources, some for teachers who don't and some for students who are self-studying without an AP teacher.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Regardless of whether or not the College Board instituted early AP exam registration and online tools with positive intents, the policies benefits few people. By increasing students' stress, racking up the costs associated with standardized testing and wasting staff members' time, the changes are clearly lacking. "If the true purpose of taking AP exams is to receive college credit or receive experience in taking a college-level class," as Blaha says, "then it shouldn't matter when you register for a test." To truly optimize student success, the College Board must revert to their old systems.&nbsp;</span></p>	32197
32370	'Tis the season to be conscious of unnecessary waste	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Don't dream of a white Christmas, dream of a green one! Between 38,000 miles of ribbon, and $11 billion worth of packing material, the amount of trash produced in the U.S. increases by roughly </span><a href="https://www.neefusa.org/holiday-waste" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">25 percent</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> during the holiday season. This year, choose to give sustainably, or give the gift of sustainability to your friends and family.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Let's talk wrapping paper: skip out on king-size rolls of glossy prints and opt for a reusable option instead. Reusing newspapers, sheet music, maps and book pages gives a gift some flair, whether it be classy, vintage or worldly. Give scrap paper a second life as gift packaging by painting one side. If you're feeling creative, try drawing or stamping personalized prints on kraft paper, a 100 percent biodegradable product made from unbleached wood pulp.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What about sustainable gift packaging you can repurpose year after year? Furoshiki, the art of Japanese fabric wrapping, uses a square of fabric to wrap anything from clothes to food. In recent years, furoshiki has also emerged as a popular, sustainable way to wrap holiday gifts.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Consider the bliss of an ice cream cone or a taco. Similar to the edible waffle cone or corn tortilla that envelops a delectable filling, furoshiki serves as a two-in-one, where the packaging is as much a gift as the present inside.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Need a gift for someone with fashion sense (or lack thereof)? The thrift store is a one-stop shop to find unique prints, whether they be on clothing racks or from the fabric section. Incorporate current seasonal fashion trends by gifting items wrapped in satin, canvas, linen, or tulle scarves and fabrics. The textile world is boundless— try upcycling a chenille sweater or Mom's old corduroy pants.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For gifts that aren't already in the shape of a sturdy prism, a tidy wrap job may prove a challenge. Thankfully, repurposed cereal boxes and other pantry cardboard boxes serve as a convenient way to package less structured items. Straw baskets and artisan craft boxes add a fancier touch, serving both an aesthetic and practical purpose. For an outdoorsy look, dress up a simple box or kraft paper package&nbsp;with twine, pine branches, or dried flowers.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32369"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Not only does sustainable packaging avoid one-time waste, it also gives recipients the resources to avoid future waste, perpetuating a continuous cycle that will lower current packaging waste statistics for years to come.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">So, you're now fully equipped with eco-friendly gift wrapping strategies— want more? Take the next big step by handcrafting gifts and buying local, which saves both the carbon footprint of home delivery and the packaging that comes in the mail. "This year, I want to start start only giving used or sustainably made things, specifically not ordering from Amazon because the shipping is bad for the environment," junior Anna Grace O' Malley says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even when receiving gifts covered in a less conscious way, aim to unwrap them carefully and salvage any materials, whether it be trimming the edges of wrapping paper used for a larger gift to wrap a new, smaller one, or saving a ribbon bow.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to gifting sustainably, consider a gift that leads to a lower-waste lifestyle. Items such as </span><a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/products/bamboo-toothbrush-adult" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">bamboo toothbrushes</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, </span><a href="http://www.nohbodrops.com/order/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">package-free shampoo pods</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, </span><a href="https://www.beeswrap.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">beeswax food wrap</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, </span><a href="https://us.keepcup.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">reusable coffee cups</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><a href="https://rezip.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">silicone sandwich bags</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> reduce the need for single-use plastics. Although slightly pricier, </span><a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/products/guppyfriend" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">guppy bags</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> serve as a protective filter in the laundry machine that stops microfibers in synthetic clothing from reaching wastewater streams. For the avid holiday baker, gift </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/oxo-12pk-baking-cups/-/A-53257633" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">silicone cupcake liners</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> or </span><a href="https://www.target.com/p/silicone-baking-mat-made-by-design-8482/-/A-53536095" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">a silicone baking mat</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Finally, gift experiences rather than objects— the ultimate form of avoiding waste. Take a friend or family member out to a movie they've been dying to see, an amusement park or a pottery studio. According to O' Malley, donating to a cause that someone supports is an even better way to eliminate the carbon footprint when gift-giving. "My mom's birthday is Dec. 30, so we usually have two different gift-giving occasions for her," O' Malley says. "However, she doesn't want any gifts this year, and wants instead for us to donate to a climate justice non-profit."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the end of the day, gifting is meant for showing appreciation for loved ones, and it can come in various shapes and forms. Whether you're gifting a handmade present, reusing old packaging, investing in reusable materials or avoiding a tangible gift altogether, stay on the look out for creative ways to gift green. Happy holiday gifting!</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32369

And if you don’t have that, I think it’s probably the easier choice to just change [the name],” Mrkoci said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cleveland’s name change has also </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/some-native-americans-applaud-cleveland-indians-name-change-say-it-n1251183" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">raised questions regarding how to honor Native Americans and Sockalxis without being offensive.</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Mrckoci believes that while the name chosen by Cleveland was too offensive, it’s still possible to have respectful team names pertaining to Native Americans. “I think if you’re able to change it to something a little more politically correct, I guess, then you might be able to be more respectful to some people who are bothered by it,” Mrkoci said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lott offered a suggestion similar to how the MLB honors Jackie Robinson. The league’s first Black player. “I know that MLB has a ‘Jackie Robinson’ day in which they wear Jackie Robinson’s number...they could do something like that. Maybe one day a year they could wear jerseys with a native language on it,” Lott said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Both the timing and nature of the name change creates parallels with the Washington Football team. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/washingtonnfl/status/1282661063943651328?lang=en" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">In a statement released on Twitter</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, the organization announced on July 13 that they would be dropping the name and mascot of “Redskins” after 87 years. </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/07/13/washingtons-name-change-happened-fast-it-was-decades-making/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">The name has drawn heavy criticism since 1972.</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Both name changes came in the months following the killing of George Floyd by police, the widespread Black Lives Matter protests and a nationwide reckoning over American racism.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair senior and 4-year baseball player Nick Layke indicated that the decision by Cleveland was probably influenced by the one made in Washington. “I do think that the Washington Football Team influenced the Cleveland Indians...There are a number of teams with these insensitive names, and the Washington Football Team wasn’t the first to change their names, but they were definitely one of the most prevalent ones recently...So I think that sort of paved the way for some other teams to sort of ‘take up the train,’ so to speak,” Layke said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Other teams in the realm of sports, like the MLB’s Atlanta Braves, the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and the NHL’s Chicago Black Hawks (all of which have attracted controversy in the past) </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nhl/blackhawks/2020/12/17/blackhawks-dont-plan-change-team-nickname/3947497001/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">are all standing by their names.</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> </span></p>	33246
32563	The new initiative gives uninsured Americans access to PrEp, aiming to end the HIV epidemic	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Dec. 3, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the launch of their Ready, Set, PrEP initiative. The program provides pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a prescription drug that prevents HIV, free of cost to those without insurance coverage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">According to the </span><a href="https://phpa.health.maryland.gov/OIDEOR/CHSE/Pages/statistics.aspx" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Maryland Department of Health</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, there were 994 reported diagnoses and 31,559 people living with HIV in Maryland by the end of 2018, with many other cases undiagnosed or not reported. Despite these numbers, there were only </span><a href="https://aidsvu.org/local-data/united-states/south/maryland/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">2,803 PrEP</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> users in the state in 2018.

However, the program does not always cover the costs of lab tests and clinic visits.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Ready, Set, PrEP initiative is part of President Donald Trump’s goal to end the HIV epidemic. The administration created </span><a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/overview" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> in the beginning of 2019, which aims to reduce the number of HIV infections by 75 percent in five years. “Connecting members of vulnerable communities to prevention services and medication is an important part of the President’s initiative,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/12/03/ready-set-prep-expands-access-to-medication-to-prevent-hiv.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">press release.</a></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pharmacies CVS, Rite Aid and Walgreens have all agreed to provide free shipping of PrEP medication as part of the Ready, Set, PrEP program. The combined efforts of the government and participating pharmacies to create awareness about HIV and accessibility to medication will hopefully reduce the number of HIV cases and advance the administration's goal of ending the HIV epidemic.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Get tested so that you know your status and you know what to do from there,” Blair’s school nurse Anisa Harris advises. “I would recommend that everybody, all students get tested. There are clinics available in Montgomery County where you can get tested for free. That is the most important thing that they need to know.”</span></p>	32562
33121	How Blair students celebrated Thanksgiving, and what precautions they are taking to make the holidays more safe during the COVID-19 pandemic	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Thanksgiving is usually a holiday filled with friends, family and food, but this year it was just filled with food. As COVID-19 cases continue to climb and the United States reaches record highs of cases each day, families are struggling with how to celebrate Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33120"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Thanksgiving marks the start of a series of winter holidays where we must modify our traditions. </span><a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/celebrate-thanksgiving-safely-covid-19" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">In conversation with Yale Medicine</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Yale Medicine Infectious Disease Specialist Manisha Juthani, MD described why these holidays could lead to even more of a spike in COVID-19 cases. “</span><span style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13);">The problem is that we have all of these holidays coming during winter, when the cold weather forces people inside. People want to be with their loved ones, but this is where transmission events are happening, more so than in schools,” Dr. Juthani states.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13);">Sophomore Boone Schaffer believes that staying inside and limiting the spread of the virus should be a priority. “</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">It is a big disappointment because Thanksgiving and seeing friends and family is something I look forward to each year, [but] the health and safety of other people in this country is very important,” Schaffer says. Schaffer is used to having a large gathering with extended family as well as neighbors and friends where they enjoy a meal and share what they are thankful for; however, this year he and his immediate family celebrated alone. </span><span style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(13, 13, 13);">Another Yale Medicine Infectious Disease Specialist, Jaimie Meyer, MD, MS further explained the importance of staying home. “To have zero risk of infection, we would need to cancel all holidays, stay home, and keep completely to ourselves...anything we do beyond that takes on some degree of risk, particularly when case levels are increasing in most places in the country,” Dr. Meyer says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/upshot/how-epidemiologists-spending-thanksgiving.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">a poll conducted by the New York Times</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> surveying 635 epidemiologists, 64 percent planned on spending Thanksgiving with only those in their household, 21 percent plan on celebrating with those outside of their immediate household and 16 percent don’t plan on having a Thanksgiving dinner at all. The New York Times noted that those epidemiologists who did plan on seeing those outside of their household were, “going to great lengths to do so in a safe way.” Getting tested and quarantining prior to the gathering, wearing masks, and following social distancing protocols can significantly lessen the risk of COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Ila Raso believes staying home is the best option. “</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">I think safe interactions, such as meeting outside with masks on can be a fun alternative, but overall, I think it’s best that families stay home and not risk spreading or getting the virus,” Raso notes. Raso usually travels to Pennsylvania to visit extended family, but this year she is stayed home.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Families are still looking for ways to celebrate and talk with relatives. One way many families are choosing is to speak to family or friends over Zoom. In an interview with the New York Times, Bill Strohsnitter, an affiliate associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School is participating in what the New York Times is calling a Zoom-giving. “It’s just me, and while I usually have a place to go, this year I intend to stay home and just Skype or Zoom with family and friends instead,” Strohsnitter says. Raso and her family also celebrated over Zoom. “Since we are staying home this year, we may zoom with my grandparents for dessert instead of visiting them in person. We will also call and communicate with as many family members as possible to wish them a happy Thanksgiving,” Raso explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Freshman Norah McCray is also opting for a Zoom celebration. “I'm just celebrating at home and we are going to do a Zoom call with my dad's family rather than going to see them in person in Massachusetts,” McCray says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">While McCray usually visits extended family, freshman Dami Kim is used to celebrating with just her immediate family or family friends. She doesn’t have any extended family in the country, so not seeing relatives in person this Thanksgiving was nothing new. Her family still wants to ensure a special holiday despite the restrictions. “We plan on eating Thanksgiving food to create a holiday feeling and spending time with each other,” Kim explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Senior Devasana Sitaram’s Thanksgiving hasn’t changed much either. Sitaram is used to enjoying a meal with just her mother. They have their own take on Thanksgiving food. “We’re vegetarians so we made tacos instead of the typical turkey,” Sitaram says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Thanksgiving may have looked different this year, but Blair students are still finding safe ways to celebrate this holiday and talk to family members they may not be able to see. Despite all of the restrictions surrounding this Thanksgiving, Blazers are still able to focus on the core of this holiday, gratitude. As Schaffer says, “[We want to] continue the tradition of having the thanksgiving dinner every year...enjoying eachothers company and just recognizing the things we are thankful for this year [is what’s] really important.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33120
31622	Despite a strong comeback in the second half, the Blazers were defeated in the end	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair's varsity girls basketball team (4-5) lost to the Sherwood Warriors (8-1) with a final score of 46-51 on Friday night. Following a tied score at the end of the fourth quarter, overtime saw the Warriors edge out in front.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The game got off to a slow start with strong defense from both teams. Sherwood scored the first point of the match with a successful free throw. The Blazers responded with a two-pointer, but the Warriors' quick interception and successive basket forced Blair to lose their lead. Sophomore guard Kate Hildebrandt skillfully evaded Sherwood's defense and scored another basket for the Blazers. Following a foul on Blair's part, Sherwood made another free throw to even up the score at 4-4. The Blazers failed to hold back Sherwood's two successive baskets to close the first quarter behind 4-8.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers fell back even further during the second quarter and faced a 13-point deficit. Multiple failed shots and free throws by the Blazers kept them behind, while the Warriors scored a three-pointer and three two-pointers. After Sherwood called a time-out, a basket each by the Warriors and the Blazers made the score 6-19.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore center Peyton Martin capitalized on the remaining three minutes by scoring two baskets and a free throw. Sherwood responded with two successive two-pointers, pulling the score to 11-23. Following another Blair basket and two successful free throws by senior forward Sarah Khan, the Blazers entered halftime behind 15-23.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the second half, the Blazers were charged with energy and made a huge comeback. Baskets by senior captain and guard Megan Burke, junior guard Zoe Abramson and junior forward Lucy Martin helped the Blazers narrow the deficit to 21-25.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31621"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A successful free throw by Blair and a basket by junior guard Janie Pitner all but eliminated Sherwood's earlier lead. The Sherwood coach called another time-out as the Warriors kept failing to score. When the game restarted, Martin and Pitner each scored, tying the score up. Then, Sherwood fouled Hildebrant, who made both free throws to give Blair a lead of 30-28. The Blazers were able to hold off Sherwood's offense until the final seconds of the third quarter, when Sherwood scored a three-pointer to end the quarter at 31-30.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both teams struggled to take the lead during the fourth quarter. After Sherwood scored another three-pointer, Martin scored a basket and a free throw. Another basket and a free throw for both teams kept the score close with the Blazers down 36-37. The two teams matched each other goal-for-goal, leaving the score at 41-41 with less than three minutes left to the match.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A two-pointer scored by Lucy Martin helped Blair take the lead 43-41 with only 27 seconds left to the match. The Blazers fouled the Warriors, letting their opponents score a free throw. With 14 seconds left, the Blazers committed another foul, giving Sherwood two additional free throw opportunities. After they made the first one to tie the score at 43-43, Blair coach Amy Ferguson called a time-out. The Warriors missed the second free throw, forcing the game to go into a fifth period.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sherwood took possession first and scored, but a basket and successful free throw by Martin helped Blair take the lead 46-45. Continued fouls on both teams' parts helped Sherwood take the lead 49-46, especially when the Blazers failed to make their free throws. In the last seven seconds of the game, Sherwood scored a final two-pointer and solidified their lead 51-46.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite a tough first half, the Blazers put their best foot forward to tie the score at the end of the second half. Unfortunately, the Warriors managed to come out on top by the end the match.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, January 25th against the Whitman Vikings at 5:30 p.m.</em></p>	31621
31971	JUULs and e-cigarettes are fueling a teenage nicotine epidemic.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A hit at the back of the room or a rip in the bathroom with friends. Watermelon, mint, mango, or cucumber flavorings. A sleek and easy design for a unique “vapor experience”. These aspects of a JUUL are just some of the superficial marketing tactics that are being used by the company to attract future electronic cigarette users. There is only one problem. JUUL is drawing the wrong crowd.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Alarmingly, there has been a recent rise in teenage juuling, a new type of vaping pen. Originally, JUUL was made to help addicted smokers quit smoking and eliminate the traditional cigarette. Ironically, JUUL is now helping to create the next generation of smokers. Attracted by JUUL’s compact designs and enticing flavors, teenagers have now been introduced to the dangers of nicotine. Through online peer pressure and glamorized ads, the internet and social media are only making this dangerous spike in adolescent e-cigarette usage worse.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Everyone knows that smoking kills. Lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes and even death are some of the well known consequences of smoking.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">JUULs should be a safer alternative, right?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Wrong. In fact, this is a common misconception of e-cigarettes. One of the most cited reasons for continued smoking is an early start. Young smokers often have the you-only-live-once mentality, believing that they could quit smoking at any time. However, the </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/01/11/health/still-smoking/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">director of the Duke Center for Smoking Cessation</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> comments that young smokers will ultimately “lose their capacity to make a free choice to smoke”. The </span><a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs339/en/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">World Health Organization</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> even calls nicotine a “gradual killer”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite what you may think, the flavored liquid in JUULs does contain nicotine. According to the </span><a href="http://www.center4research.org/the-dangers-of-juuling/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">National Center for Health Research</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, one JUUL pod has the same amount of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. The use of multiple pods in one sitting can cause the amount of consumed nicotine to reach dangerous levels.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31970"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Adolescents who fall victim to “juuling” are introduced to nicotine at an unacceptably young age. According to a study conducted by the </span><a href="http://www.center4research.org/the-dangers-of-juuling/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">American Journal of Medicine</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, non-smokers are four times more likely to start smoking traditional cigarettes after only 18 months of vaping, which includes juuling. Vaping as a teenager can start a lifetime of misery.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Vaping and juuling have been proven to be horrible for teenagers, and most people know it. If that’s the case, why is juuling among teenagers still so rampant? The answer is in our phones and in our friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The irresistible desire of wanting to fit in can compel us to make poor decisions. Likewise, with juuling, peer pressure and high school culture can make vaping seem like a “fun” activity. Social media ads promoting e-cigarettes can make the impulse to buy even more uncontrollable.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Additionally, Hollywood level celebrities and influencers who vape or promote vaping can add to the teenage vaping epidemic. Rappers like A$AP Rocky and Snoop Dog who have their own vape products or Youtubers like David Dobrik who shows vaping in his videos can convey a very bad message to teens - that vaping is “cool”.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In order to fight the rise in adolescent vaping, society needs to change as a whole. </span><a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/07/04/netflix-pledges-to-reduce-smoking-/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Netflix recently announced</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> plans to exclude smoking and tobacco scenes from new shows and movies. Other social media platforms need to follow suit. Instagram, Youtube and Snapchat, among others, should start flagging vaping/juuling content as inappropriate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Influencers also need to be a part of the solution. Celebrities need to stop condoning vaping and start creating movements to end this wave of teenage addiction. Celebrities and influencers are the best outlets to create change and get teenagers to listen. Harsher laws also need to be passed for underage vaping/juuling. Since the JUUL is so compact, it is easy to hide. Tighter security and stricter rules in schools must be enforced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Society must implement change now. If we don’t, the number of nicotine-addicted teenagers and inevitable early deaths will continue to rise.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31970
32764	An open letter about the weird weather we've been enduring lately	<p>Dear Mother Nature,</p><p>Hi. My name is Andrew Gelman. I'd like to start by saying that I'm a big fan. Earth is a pretty cool place. You did a good job with that.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm writing to you today from a place of frustration. I'm frustrated with the weather.&nbsp;</p><p>Like what the heck, dude? We had a good thing going. The winter is supposed to be cold and the summer is supposed to be warm. It's a very simple idea.&nbsp;</p><p>But for some reason, YOU decided to make this winter warm. The two month span between December 2019 and January 2020 was the warmest that span has been since 1895. There's no way that it's the human race's fault, right?&nbsp;</p><p>You have crushed so many children's dreams by not granting us enough snow days. Instead, you forced students to wear their pajamas inside out and then made them get up at 6:00 am and go to school anyways. It's an obnoxious thing to do. Would it've killed you to throw us a bone and give us some more snow days? I guess so.</p><p>Another thing: why has it been raining so much? I like plants as much as the next guy, but do we need that much rain? This isn't a season-specific thing, but more of a general complaint. Chill out with that precipitation thing. No one likes the rain. It's not really a big thing, but it's an avoidable annoyance. Well, I'm assuming it's avoidable. I don't really know how you control the weather like that.&nbsp;</p><p>While we're on the subject, can we make summer a bit cooler? Just a little bit less hot? You're in charge of changing the climate, not us. That would be great.</p><p>Look, I'm not trying to be ungrateful here. You do a pretty good job at running this whole weather thing. Just make a few changes.&nbsp;</p><p>I look forward to hearing back from you soon.</p><p>-Andrew Gelman</p><p>P.S. I'm really sorry about that whole climate change thing. It kinda sucks. Our bad.</p><p><br></p>	32763
32766	Society is fascinated by serial killers, but it cannot rationalize their actions	<p>“Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile,” is a mistake on Netflix’s part. The two hour drama centers around the crimes of Ted Bundy from the perspective of his longtime girlfriend. Bundy is played by High School Musical star and teen heartthrob Zac Efron. In all the commotion to watch Efron, audiences forgot one important fact: Ted Bundy killed more than 20 people.</p><p>Bundy, born in 1946, had a difficult time growing up; his shyness left him susceptible to bullying and his strained relationship with his stepfather left him lonely. But, this is no excuse for his actions. He later had a successful college education , with his intelligence and social skills supporting&nbsp;him. Bundy had a series of normal relationships with various women. At least, that’s what the people around him thought. Between 1974 and 1978, he sexually assaulted and subsequently killed several women in Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Utah, and Florida.</p><p>Bundy was sentenced to death twice during his highly publicized trials; first in 1979 for the killing of two college students as well as the following year for the rape and murder of a 12-year old. He confessed to 28 murders though some believe he was responsible for hundreds more. Bundy was ultimately executed in an electric chair in 1989. However, society’s fascination with Bundy did not die.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32765"></div><p>The media romanticizes Ted Bundy and every other dedicated serial killer. And society falls for it every time. Companies have profited from selling merchandise with the faces of serial killers starring on the front. The selling of personal items of killers on eBay is even creepier. With the click of a button, the public can get their hands on Bundy's hair, letters from Gainesville serial killer Danny Rolling or even a pinch of dirt from the crawl space where John Wayne Gacy buried 27 young men and boys. Where does the obsession stop?</p><p>According to the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, “Serial killing is the rarest form of homicide, occurring when an individual has killed three or more people who were previously unknown to him or her, with a ‘cooling off’ period between each murder.” How can society sympathize with that?</p><p>Think about the families who have lost loved ones because of these killers. Documentaries and films can analyze the decisions behind these people, but ultimately they are still murderers. Their own decisions have gotten them to the place where they are and society cannot rationalize them. If someone killed a person that you love, would you wear a t-shirt with their face on it in public?&nbsp;</p><p>Ted Bundy is not a hero. Danny Rolling is not a hero. John Wayne Gacy is not a hero. They do not deserve to be joked about and related to. We cannot treat them as though they have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. These are killers who have destroyed lives. And society needs to be mindful of that.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	32765
33188	New ways to enjoy the fall season as the COVID-19 pandemic has altered many outdoor activities.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIt is that time of year again: Brightly-colored leaves are strewn across the ground, pumpkin spice lattes are steaming from the cup, and of course, eagerly anticipated trips to orchards and haunted houses are on our minds. Many of us are not rural residents, spending most of our time surrounded by tall buildings as opposed to flat farmland, but the magical season of fall has always offered us an oasis—the chance to go on a hayride, pick apples at the farm, or take a trip to the pumpkin patch.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33186"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">﻿The COVID-19 pandemic has completely altered the scope of outdoor activities. In the early months of the pandemic, countless concerts, picnics, and festivals were canceled. Summer, it seems, flew right by.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHowever, with a second chance of sorts as we move through the fall season, many events are being adapted. With ample space to allow visitors to socially distance outdoors, farms and other hosts of outdoor activities are continuing autumnal traditions in a unique way.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tBlair history teacher Marc Grossman, who runs a local organic mixed vegetable farm, notes that farmers markets are a great way to enjoy the outdoors and buy produce. “You are outside, the air is well ventilated, [the food] is fresh,” he says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMoreover, despite the adjustments that had to be made early in the year due to COVID-19, these markets have maintained that festive seasonal environment. According to Grossman, whose local farmers market has required masks and enforced social distancing since early April, "they are fun, they are exciting, they are vibrant.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFarmers markets are not the only way to enjoy seasonal activities. Butler’s Orchard, for example, is a farm in Germantown where guests can pick their own food. The orchard now requires reservations, masks, and social distancing to promote safety while still offering sweet fruit and a memorable experience—from pick-your-own pumpkins to private bonfires and hayrides.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tOther local farms, like Summers Farm in Frederick, are hosting fall festivals complete with corn mazes and wagon rides, reminiscent of our pre-pandemic days.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tCraving a good scare? While trick-or-treating under a full blue moon may not be possible this Halloween, several outdoor haunted trails and fields remain open. Markoff’s Haunted Forest and Field of Screams Maryland, both in Montgomery County, are still operational and will be open until Nov. 1.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHowever, engaging with the outdoors and traditional fall events isn’t just about enjoying the season for our own benefit. It is also about showing up for our local businesses and farms who have been supporting our communities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEarly in the pandemic, many people took interest in the source of their food for the first time. “In those last two weeks of March, [people] saw empty shelves,” Grossman recalls. “And for the first time ever, I think there were a lot of people who asked themselves, ‘Where is my food coming from?’”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tSince then, farms have been operating to support the community. “I have never before donated hundreds and hundreds of pounds of produce to Manna [Food Center], but I am this year,” Grossman says. He receives some compensation for the donations, which are a part of a program spearheaded by the Montgomery County Food Council.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tWhile attempting to provide food to food banks, farms are taking a hit as the restaurant industry suffers. For Grossman, 15 percent of his revenue comes from restaurant sales—but not this year. “We made the call: We aren't going to sell to restaurants this year,” he says. His farm has been providing food to restaurants for a decade.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe pandemic has caused a “tidal wave of change,” as Grossman puts it. However, fall has always been a season of enjoying and engaging with the outdoors. Following safety protocols, we have the opportunity to make the most out of this unorthodox autumn while also supporting our local businesses and farms. It is the breath of fresh air we all deserve.</span></p>	33186
33235	On a rainy Sunday afternoon at Fedex Field, a man wearing a burgundy uniform with number 11 on the back trotted onto the field for the first time in nearly 2 years	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On a rainy Sunday afternoon at Fedex Field, a man wearing a burgundy uniform with number 11 on the back trotted onto the field for the first time in nearly 2 years. Washington quarterback Alex Smith had officially completed his comeback after suffering what many believed was a career-ending injury in 2018. By the end of the 2020 season, Smith led his team to an NFC East title.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33234"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The injury occured during a game against the Houston Texans in November 2018, when Smith’s leg was bent awkwardly while getting sacked by lineman J.J Watt and safety Kareem Jackson. Smith screamed in agony as he lay on the ground before being carted off the field, silencing the crowd at Fedex Field.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The details of the injury were graphic. Smith </span><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/espn-documentary-will-show-alex-smiths-injury-and-recovery-is-probably-worse-than-you-realize-161952523.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACC_fmBs6AWSD05_PsotXOEgaZw2m8kt_EEDSlKmVzHUPn3g9Kf5p-hRLKrGlBLBvGb76iR8DZjTeqMw7Z2urx7kwz9wRnBGPZ3aAPZaCm0CZsmW7bq6nqnsQ72vI-EptIu6OP9nWASkr_uUEpvjFg9Awd7hINzRE9YqL8NATo3b" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">suffered a compound fracture</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> which resulted in two bones breaking his skin. After undergoing surgery to repair the compound fracture, his leg became infected with sepsis, a condition capable of causing organ failure. This required an additional 17 surgeries, nearly resulting in the amputation of his leg. </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/02/01/alex-smith-fully-details-his-leg-injury-first-time-says-he-is-lucky-be-alive/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Smith later said</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> he is “Very much lucky to be alive, very lucky to still have my leg.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith underwent most of his treatment at a San Antonio military hospital. One military doctor even referred to the injury as “war-like.” He required months of wheelchair use, crutches, and rehab.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The injury strangely occured on the 33 year anniversary of former Washington QB Joe Theismann’s infamous career-ending injury, which was almost identical to Smith’s. Besides the impact on their respective careers, there was one major difference: Joe Theismann was in no danger of losing his leg or his life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Given the severity of his injury and its similarity to Joe Theismann’s injury, many fans and pundits wrote off Smith’s chances of a comeback. “I knew it was serious...at the time I thought he was probably never going to play again” said Andy Merrill (11). Merrill, also a quarterback for the Blair football team, felt somewhat uneasy after witnessing Smith’s injury. “I was a bit more cautious the next time I practiced, and the possibility of having that type of injury was in the back of my head but I never went out there thinking I was going to get injured,” Merrill recounted.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the adversity, Alex Smith never lost his determination to return to the field. Shortly before the 2020 season, team doctors cleared the veteran QB to begin practicing, giving fans optimism that he would return. “I started to believe Smith would play again during the offseason when he was working out and doing drills on the field again,” said Merrill.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith remained sidelined throughout the first 4 weeks of the season until coach Ron Rivera benched second-year QB Dwayne Haskins. Despite suiting up for a game against the Los Angeles Rams, Smith was expected to remain as backup to Kyle Allen for at least the next few games. When Allen was injured in the first half, Alex Smith stepped back into action. He completed his first pass to running back J.D Mckissic, then smiled in the direction of the camera. “When the announcer said Smith was warming up to enter the game, I was very surprised and excited...it was surreal to say the least to see him come back from that injury,” Merrill remembers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This season, Smith threw for 1,582 yards, 6 touchdowns and completed 66.4% of passes. Despite finishing with a losing record, Washington won the NFC East due to a mediocre division.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The return of Alex Smith is nothing short of a miracle. The odds of coming back from this injury were slim at best, yet he defied them. Finding the courage and resilience of Alex Smith is difficult, and local fans should feel proud to have him representing our city. In what has been an otherwise </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/the-nfl-needs-to-force-dan-snyder-to-sell-his-franchise-32909/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">tumultuous year</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for the franchise, Washington fans deserve to witness a player wearing burgundy and gold pull off a miracle and send his team to the playoffs.&nbsp;</span></p>	33234

No había nadie que nos estaban enseñando cómo navegar esto: Cómo crear el show, que manera que la gente envíe sus actuaciones, cosas así… todo fue como un bebe, estamos aprendiendo de la primera vez”.&nbsp;</p><p>En las audiciones, Rivera cuenta que hubieron algunas canciones que les sorprendieron, “la que me gustó a mi fue Carlos, el hizo [una canción de] Aventura y ese estilo de música no es algo que yo… escuchaba de niño… pero a la gente le encanta Aventura y bachata y yo estaba como ‘okay, miremos como se escucha’ y… yo siento que se escuchaban más o menos igualitos y esa fue una de las más sorprendentes”.&nbsp;</p><p>Carlos Castro Gomez, el estudiante del décimo grado que cantó “Cuando Volverás” por Aventura, cuenta la razon por la cual el escogió esa cancion, “<span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">yo he sido fanático desde que, desde que oí de ellos cuando yo estaba chiquito”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Este fue el primer año que Castro Gomez participó en la obra, pero pudo ver Fiesta Blair el año pasado, “yo no estaba en esto de los shows, pues no sabía, pero me gustó el show, me gustó la energía, como todos hicieron y quería ser parte y esta era mi oportunidad”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Además, Castro Gomez piensa que Voces Unidas “introduce a nuevas personas de otras religiones [y] de otras culturas [y] hace ver que la herencia hispana no es como dicen otras personas… creo que teniendo ese show influencia a la escuela que vean que somos como cualquier otro humano, solo [una] diferente cultura”.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33291"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Castro Gomez no tuvo mucha experiencia antes de participar en Voces Unidas pero él cuenta que, “simplemente traté de usar otras cosas que yo aprendí cuando yo estaba en el octavo grado cuando yo hice un show… claro [esta vez] tenía que estar enfrente de una cámara y… estar enfrente de personas [ayudo] y yo trate de usar la misma táctica y me salió bien”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Al participar en Voces Unidas, Castro Gomez cuenta que sus familiares estuvieron sorprendidos en su talento, “les enseñé [mi video] a mis padres, mis familiares, mi tío también, mi tía que vive en Los Ángeles también, todo[s] mis familiares lo vieron y ellos, ellos [estuvieron] sorprendidos que, que yo tenía ese talento, que ellos nunca han oído [o] visto”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">También, a Castro Gomez le gusto poder mostrar su talento a sus amigos, “me gustó que yo podía tener mi imagen afuera y bueno yo podía enseñar lo que podía [hacer] a todos mis otros compañeros que no saben lo que puedo hacer”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Otros estudiantes, como Gwendolyn Gomez quien está en el doceavo grado, participó este año cantando “Rey” por Christine D’CLario, una canción de adoración de parte de su religión y cuenta que al escoger la canción se sintió, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">aceptada y sabiendo... que nuestra comunidad no encuentra la religión como algo extraño o como un tema incómodo del que hablamos… me sentí cómoda cantando”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Rivera también cuenta lo que le gusta de actuar además de dirigir la obra, “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">para mi me encanta… hacer shows es lo que me inspira hacer trabajo… El año pasado fue la primera vez que no necesariamente estaba enfrente del show y estaba detrás y lo estaba [dirigiendo] y encontré que me encante los dos lugares”.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\t</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Después de participar en Voces Unidas, Castro Gomez estaba agradecido de tener la oportunidad, él dice, “los directores fueron los más amables… [no los] podían agradecer más… por darme la oportunidad de hacer algo tan bueno… [como] Voces Unidas en Blair”. Castro Gomez aumenta que participar en la obra también le puede ayudar en el futuro, “[en] actuar tal vez se saca una beca o alguien viene importante de una escuela de canto y ellos… pueden ver lo que usted puede hacer debajo de presión con personas enfrente de usted y estar día y día… recordando [tus lineas]… y solo Voces Unidas y también teatro el año pasado me han dado una oportunidad de mi imagen salir afuera a otras personas para descubrir lo que puedo hacer”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33292"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Para la obra del mes de herencia hispana del próximo año, Castro Gomez está seguro que participará, “si… este show [estuvo] tan bueno virtualmente, ¿cómo no va a salir de bueno en persona?… siempre me ha gustado el canto desde chiquito, siempre me ha gustado de estar enfrente de personas y yo siento que la segunda vez si podemos regresar [a la escuela] yo…&nbsp;[haria] mejor de como hice [esta vez]”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Además de participar de nuevo, Castro Gomez recomendaría a otros estudiantes que participen en Voces Unidas, “yo he tenido una buena experiencia. Yo creo que más de las otras personas que podían hacer eso creo que también [tuvieron una buena experiencia]… Yo digo que otras personas, si tienen talento de cantar, bailar, leer cualquier poema que vengan a tratar Voces Unidas y que ellos enseñen al mundo que ellos pueden hacer otra cosa… Yo sugiero que vengan a audicionar”.</span></p>	33290
33334	Blazers are hopeful for the new administration, and have different ideas for what the Biden administration should prioritize through their policies	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Biden administration has not been in power long; however, in the first few weeks of their administration, they have implemented many impactful executive orders to undo many Trump-era policies.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33333"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the Biden administration has a wide variety of policies to put in place and issues to address, many Blazers believe that the COVID-19 pandemic and current vaccine shortages should be the top priority. In January, the United States reached the tragic milestone of 400,000 Americans lost to COVID-19. Even though there are two tested and approved vaccines being distributed across the country, many states, including Maryland, are experiencing vaccine shortages. The United States has only fully vaccinated 5.1 percent of the population, and partially vaccinated 13 percent of the population.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the primaries, the issues most important to sophomore Sam Valesquez were climate change and racial justice. Now, Velasquez believes COVID-19 should be the Biden administration’s top priority, but hopes Biden will be able to focus on other issues in the long run. “I think right now the Biden administration should focus on&nbsp;getting [COVID-19] under control so unemployment doesn’t become worse and less people get sick and die," Velasquez says. "I hope they will focus on racial injustice and climate change."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Velasquez did not have to wait long term for President Biden to start working on racial justice. On Biden’s first day in office he passed an </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">executive order to promote racial equity</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. The executive order includes a variety of provisions to advance racial equity in the government itself and in the country through the reallocation of federal money and other resources. This order has the goal of “advanc[ing] equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Velasquez is content with what the Biden administration has accomplished so far. “I’m happy…[COVID-19] cases are already getting lower and lower which is a good sign,” he notes. According to the New York Times, as of Feb. 9 COVID-19 cases have decreased by 35 percent in the past 14 days.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Amelia Schuler agrees that Biden should focus on COVID-19. “The Biden administration’s top priority should be on pushing a more effective COVID-19 plan as well as working closely with states to form a more standard approach to distributing vaccines. The primary concern should be getting the virus under control, which I feel will help with other issues relating to the lockdown, such as unemployment and schooling,” Schuler says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In Biden’s first nine days in office he has already signed 18 COVID-19 and COVID-19 related executive orders. The orders spanned from establishing a mask mandate on federal property, increasing safety in the workplace, dealing with food insecurity, and the COVID-19 stimulus relief package.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Velasquez isn’t alone in his hopes for the Biden administration. Freshman Maia Turpen hopes this administration will focus on climate change. “I hope they get the U.S. more environmentally conscious and implement more regulations for the oil industry and plastic products,” Turpen explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Similar to other issues, President Biden has already taken large steps through executive orders in his first nine days to address the climate crisis. A few notable orders include&nbsp;rejoining the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Paris Agreement on climate change</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, and canceling the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Keystone XL pipeline</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. President Biden also signed multiple orders to prioritize climate change, climate change policy and research. Biden’s actions so far indicate that climate change will be a priority in his administration as both Turpen and Velasquez hoped. To find a full list with all of the executive orders President Biden signed in his first nine days, check </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/here-s-full-list-biden-s-executive-actions-so-far-n1255564" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">here</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Schuler hopes the Biden administration will prioritize immigration and take a very different route when it comes to immigration policy in comparison to the Trump Administration. “In the long run I hope the Biden administration will focus on opening more to those seeking asylum as well as creating a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants,” Schuler explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although the Biden administration has been in power for a short amount of time Blazers are already happy with what he has accomplished. Although they may not know what to expect in this new chapter, they are hopeful. As Schuler notes, “I’m optimistic...I don’t know what to expect in the long run but so far I’m happy with the direction things are going.”</span></p>	33333
32363	The sequel does not live up to the explosive first movie	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Six years ago, "Frozen" was an international phenomenon. When a sequel was announced, some were apprehensive, stating that it was too late to make another one and that it might just be a cash grab. While "Frozen 2" is an enjoyable continuation of the first movie, it is not as good as its predecessor.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The movie picks up three years after the events of “Frozen.” After Elsa (Idina Mezel) unfreezes Arendelle, she enjoys spending time with her family. However, Elsa hears a strange voice singing to her, calling her to follow a path into the unknown. She goes off on a journey with her sister Anna (Kristen Bell) and companions Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Olaf (Josh Gad) as they try to find out where the singing is leading Elsa.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The first movie is vague about Elsa's powers and their origins, as they were not the focus of that film, so the added lore is a welcome addition. "Frozen 2" introduces an enchanted forest, home to spirits and creatures connected to water, earth, fire and air. While a large portion of the film is spent inside this forest, there is not a rich exploration of the environment itself. The animals are unique in design, but how they interact with the forest is not explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The conflict starts abruptly, without proper time to build up the stakes. Unlike the first movie, which spends time exploring Elsa's fear of her powers, the magical voice leading her to her true destiny feels inorganic. Little to no time is spent fleshing out how Elsa does not belong in Arendelle.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Themes of colonialism are also explored, as Anna and Elsa learn more about their ancestors on their journey. However, "Frozen 2" does not properly execute its colonialism plotline. The movie does not show why their ancestors committed particular atrocities, but simply uses them as placeholders to tell audiences colonialism is bad. During the climax of the film, it is stressed that there must be certain consequences for the actions Anna and Elsa's ancestors committed, but Anna and Elsa never deal with them at the end, leaving audiences with a confusing message.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film introduces the idea that water has memory, which is an inventive device that makes the flashbacks to Anna and Elsa's ancestors and parents feel natural. It is also a creative way to use Elsa's powers to bring the water's memory to life and become immersed in these recollections.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32359"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In “Frozen 2”, the audience learns more about Anna and Elsa's parents. Despite these characters’ additional screen time, viewers don't get a grasp on who they are. This lack of deeper character arc is prevalent throughout the movie, making it difficult to evoke sympathy from the audience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The animation in the film is gorgeous, as expected. The "Frozen" franchise knows how to bring the beauty of winter to life with breathtaking shots of snowy landscapes and ice structures. In addition to that, "Frozen 2" also shows the beauty of fall, animating a colorful autumn forest. The animation is particularly stunning in the scene where Elsa sings "Show Yourself". As she explores a mysterious ice glacier, the way that Elsa uses her powers to create pillars of ice as she treks through the caverns is beautiful. The pure crystalline sparks Elsa uses during storytelling sequences when not actively creating ice or snow are also dazzling.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the songs in "Frozen 2" are good, they are not as catchy as the ones from "Frozen." Even "Into the Unknown", what Disney seems to be advertising as the new "Let It Go" is not the type of song that will stick in your head for a long time. But there are powerful songs. One in particular is "The Next Right Thing," which Anna sings after being separated from all of her companions. The despair in Bell’s voice accompanied by the sad stringed melody makes the audience truly feel Anna's grief through the screen.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The humor in this movie is appealing to both children and adults. Olaf, continually providing comic relief, goes through an existential crisis during the film, trying to understand what life truly means. This makes for surprisingly funny quips at times one would not expect.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32360"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The world saw “Frozen” as an incredible movie and it was going to be difficult to live up to those expectations, especially six years after the first film. Still, it's disappointing that its sequel didn't reach the same level of quality as its predecessor. But at the end of the day, the movie is entertaining. Audience members get to see the characters they know and love go off on another adventure, with a new set of fun songs and feel-good moments.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32359
33518	Blair defeats the Whitman Vikings 3-0	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair varsity girls' volleyball (1-3) secured their first win at home against the Walt Whitman Vikings in a 3-0 game. After a tight win in the first set, the Blazers upped the momentum to win three straight sets.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first set of the game started with close scores, with the score on both sides inching forward for 3-3. Following a serve from junior Christy Li, an intense rally ensued. Blair pulled ahead with a score of 7-3, but with missed receives and hits, Whitman took the lead by five points (10-15). Whitman maintained its lead until a spike by Blair's captain, senior Samantha Rodriguez, brought the ball back to Blair.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With mistakes on Whitman's part, Blair evened the score 17-17. The score broke even time and time again as both teams fought tooth and nail. As set point approached, the Blazers, with a successful block, scored the two pivotal points to win the set 25-23.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Coming off the momentum from the first set, Blair took the lead within the first few minutes of the second set, leading with a score of 11-2. After Whitman's coach called a time-out, Whitman came back and reduced the lead to only four points, 15-11.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cooperation between Blair's setter, junior Celine Wu, and Blair's outside hitter, senior Emma Weinstein, allowed Blair to pull forward. With a strong serve from Blair's libero, sophomore Karen Cao, Blair scored five consecutive points and ultimately closed out the set 25-15.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At the beginning of the third set, the Blazers charged forward, leading 5-1. Even though Whitman gradually found their rhythm and only trailed by one point, Blair still kept the lead. When the score reached 19-15 and 22-17, Whitman called two successive time-outs, hoping to win back the set. As the ball flew out of court four times in a row, Blair scored four successive points to match point.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Anticipation and excitement climbed to a peak at match point, 24-17, as the stands waited for the point that would decide the fate of the game. Whitman scored back a point, bringing the score to 24-18. But, following a hit by Weinstein, Blair won the third set 25-18, earning their first win of the season.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Deanna Earle, coach of the varsity girls' volleyball team, was proud of how the team performed on Tuesday, noting that consistency was key to securing the win. "We were fighting point for point for point; we just happened to have a winning streak at the right times of the set. Today, it was about getting the consistency more frequently and I'm really proud of how we played today," Earle said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Earle has confidence in the team going forward. "I expect fire," Earle said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game on Monday, Sept. 27 against the Blake Bengals at 6:30 p.m.</em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Editor's Note: Celine Wu and Emma Weinstein are members of Silver Chips Online.</em></p>	33513
32606	The Blazers fell 80-75 to the Blue Devils	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair boys' varsity basketball team (8-2) lost to the Springbrook Blue Devils (9-1) by a score of 80-75 in their sixth home game of the season on Wednesday, Jan. 15.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After losing the tip-off, the Blue Devils scored a three-pointer in the first 25 seconds of the game. Not even halfway into the first quarter, it was obvious that the Blue Devils would not be an easy opponent based on the teams’ rapid trading of shots. The first quarter ended with a tie at 13-13.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32605"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the second quarter, the game picked up more speed. Springbrook turned to aggressive tactics, going as far as to push senior guard Liam Olagbaju to the ground in order to take a shot. The Blue Devils kept possession of the ball for some time until junior guard Roman Cannuscio intercepted the ball. However, Springbrook retook possession soon after. In the second quarter, senior center Leon Johnson made numerous baskets, bringing eight points to the team. With a free throw from Springbrook, the quarter ended at 34-31.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For most of the third quarter, Blair took the upper hand. However, the score was 45-42, with Blair leading by only three points. With two minutes and 21 seconds left in the quarter, Springbrook made a comeback and brought the score to 45-45. The teams once again traded buckets and the quarter ended in a 51-51 tie.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout the last quarter, the game kept the audience on edge, as victory was not certain for either team. Although the Blazers were mostly in the lead, the greatest score margin in the last quarter was seven points. But this gap was quickly narrowed down to one, as the Blue Devils started to advance. Springbrook brought Blair's lead to a marginal 63-62. With three seconds left, a layup from junior guard Alfred Worrell put the Blazers in a 65-62 lead once again. It was certain that the Blazers would take home the victory. But within three seconds, a Blue Devil made a three-pointer, ending the fourth quarter in a 65-65 tie and sending the teams into overtime.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair quickly gained possession of the ball after winning the tip-off. The teams once again went into trading shots. With a minute and 47 seconds left, Blair started to lag behind, missing many shots. To prevent Springbrook from taking any more shots, Cannuscio swiped the ball from a Springbrook player, sending a roar of approval from the Blair crowd. But the score was 78-73 in Springbrook's favor, and the clock showed only 17.8 seconds left in the game. At this moment, Briggs made a field goal, bringing the score to 78-75. To keep the ball in their possession and end the game, Springbrook stopped attempting shots and passed balls to stall. The Blazers fouled a Blue Devil, who made two free throws. Those were the final points of the game, which ended 80-75.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior guard Jacob Briggs explained that Blair fought strong, but noted that Springbrook was a challenging opponent. "We played hard. We did what we were supposed to do, " Briggs said. "But they capitalized on our mistakes and ended up getting extra shots."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Coach Damon Pigrom explains that, overall, it was a disappointing game considering Blair's many mistakes. "Springbrook is too good of a team for us to make the mistakes that we made and come out victorious," Pigrom said. "We didn't rebound the ball well so they got extra possession with that. We fouled too much. When we lose a close game like this, there are multiple facets that we can't be deficient at. And we were deficient in too many areas."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From Pigrom's standpoint, he believes the game could have went differently if he had changed strategies. "In hindsight, after Alfred made his layup, I should have called [a] timeout to get us organized," Pigrom said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, Jan. 24 against the Northwood Gladiators at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	32605
32441	Getting to know the new head resource counselor and her history with Blair.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Makeyda Soriano may be Blair’s new resource counselor, but to many students and alumni, she is an old friend. Throughout her first few months as a counselor at Blair this year, she has been focused on promoting positive lifestyles across students and staff.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A noticeable change that Soriano has brought to Blair in her first few weeks has the presence of morale-boosting service dogs for the student body to interact with during lunches. The first of many initiatives to come, students can thank Soriano for the chance to destress with a canine companion over the course of the 2019-2020 school year.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Joining the Poms team as a coach halfway through the 2015 season, Soriano had already developed a good idea and image of what Blair life was like. So naturally, transferring from the Churchill Counseling department to Blair’s was an exhilarating experience. “As a coach, I get to fully see and appreciate the hard work that students strive for, even when they're tired or unsure. Being specifically a coach at Blair, gave me an appreciation for the spirit that lives in Blair and I always appreciated the inclusiveness I saw amongst students. So, when I knew I was going to be working with the student body, I was very excited!” she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This connection with poms also allowed many students to familiarize themselves with her determined and supportive personality before the school year began. Junior Poms Captain Eden Mengesha describes, “I first met coach Soriano the summer of my sophomore year. I thought she was a very empowering woman and she was always very straightforward and confident as a person and as a dancer. She would tell me to be the best person that I could be, and has been a bright light in my life.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32440"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As head resource counselor, Soriano looks to promote healthy and positive lifestyles through various initiatives and events.”We hope to continue supporting the Be Well 365 initiative through our school-wide curriculum like Signs of Suicide along with Mental Health awareness programming. We hope to bring campaigns that bring awareness to specific illnesses while providing resources and a safe space for discussion during those times.” she states.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Soriano also looks to draw more attention to the counseling department to ensure students that counselors are available to them in times of need. “ </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(23, 78, 134);">​</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I hope to continue promoting the mission and vision of our Blair School Counseling Program to support all of our Blazers academically, and socially and emotionally,&nbsp;while providing intentional engagement to ensure they are college and career prepared. Personally, I hope to promote a sense of visibility, so there can be a better understanding of our role.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For students who have approached her, Soriano has presented herself as open and easy to reach. “Even as a counselor, I could go to her for family problems or life problems. I really appreciate her,” continues Mengesha.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the near future, Soriano and the counseling department look to further their mental health awareness initiatives through issue-specific weeks that stimulate thoughtful discussion among students and staff. “During the week of National Eating Disorder Awareness Week (Feb 2020), we will be hosting a discussion and a positive body image campaign for students to participate within. At the end of the day, we want to "Rethink the Stigma" of mental health, so we can build a community that is safe for students and staff to seek support if needed,” explains Soriano.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For Soriano, these initial weeks as a counselor at Blair have been fulfilling and motivating. “ Blair has been a great experience during these first few months. I hope to continue building upon the programs that were already occurring through helping them be more visible and accessible for all of our Blazers,” she concludes.</span></p><p><br></p>	32440
32225	The Blazers couldn’t keep up with Churchill’s string finish	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair girls’ varsity volleyball team (10-4) fell 3-1 to the Churchill Bulldogs (12-2) on Friday night. While the Blazers were unable to pull off a victory on their senior night, they fought hard for every point and made some amazing plays.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The senior night ceremony was held before the game. Coach Chris Liang announced the seniors individually. There was time for photos and speeches. After a pregame cheer lead by the seniors, the game began.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32224"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The first set began with contagious energy from the crowd, pummeling the court with rambunctious cheering. The intensity threw Churchill off, and the Blazers started the game with a quick 4-1 lead. Churchill, however, came back with strong blocks and aces to win the set 15-25.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers started the second set with a 5-1 lead. Senior libero Elisabeth Jang made a well-placed pass that brought Blair up 16-11. Churchill tried to catch up with numerous kills and a timeout late into the set, but the Blazers did not relinquish the lead. Blair won the set 25-16.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the last two sets, the two teams battled for each point. Crucial kills were made by seniors Karen Yang and Lucinda Zhou. The Blazers showed good movement and communication both within the team and on the court. However, Blair could not overcome the Bulldogs, and lost the sets 15-25 and 16-25.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although Churchill took away the victory, the Blazers are positive for the playoff season. “We only have things to look forward to from here,” co-captain and senior Olivia Freer said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The senior night was emotional and the seniors commented on the strong team dynamic. “We love the underclassmen, and we saw the amount of effort they put into our senior night. We’ll do [well] at playoffs, we’re all looking forward to it,” Zhou said.&nbsp;</span></p>	32224
32519	A summary of seasons one to four	<p>Hi everybody, and welcome to The Good Podcast. We're Shifra and Vivian, SCO's resident Good Place geeks, and we're here just in time for the show's final four episodes starting this Thursday, Jan. 9 at 8:30 p.m. on NBC! If you haven't seen the first three and a half seasons of "The Good Place," we highly recommend you watch, because it's a real treat. But for those of you without much time or a good memory, no worries. There will be spoilers, so don't say "oh fork!" when we reveal any big twists. We're here to give you the scoop — of frozen yogurt — on all things Good Place, so sit back and relax!&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32520"></div><p>Here is a full transcript of the episode:</p><p>Let's jump right into it. Season one opens when Eleanor Shellstrop wakes up in the afterlife and&nbsp;meets Michael, an architect and heavenly superbeing. Michael explains that Eleanor did so many good things in her lifetime that she'll spend the afterlife in the Good Place, in a neighborhood that he designed. On her first day, Eleanor discovers that cursing in the Good Place is impossible, and meets Janet, an all-knowing AI assistant. She's then introduced to other human neighbors including Tahani, an uppity British socialite; Jianyu, a silent monk; and her supposed soulmate Chidi, an anxious ethics professor. Despite slight annoyance and disagreements, the four spend lots of time together.&nbsp;</p><p>All seems well, but there's one small problem — Eleanor isn't who the residents think she is, and she quickly realizes she was probably sent to the Good Place by mistake. Wanting to stay, she reveals her secret to Chidi and asks for his help to become a better person. One night, Jianyu secretly tells Eleanor that he's also not supposed to be in the Good Place. In fact, he isn't even a monk — he's Jason, an ex-DJ from Florida.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, each time Janet is rebooted, she also becomes more sophisticated, eventually developing human feelings. Jason appreciates her kindness because she answers questions and pulls things out of thin air, and the two get married.&nbsp;</p><p>Disaster soon strikes in the neighborhood, and Michael, assuming it's his fault, decides to retire (which, for superbeings, means being eternally tortured). Eleanor is determined to save him, so she confesses that she's supposed to be in the Bad Place. Upon hearing that Eleanor is unwillingly causing the chaos, Michael calls the demons from the Bad Place, who show up bearing the actual good Eleanor, who was accidentally sent to the Bad Place. They demand that the Good Place give up one of the four humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Eleanor, Tahani, Jason, and Chidi enter a long, self-sacrificial argument in which they each essentially claim that they'll go to the Bad Place to spare the real "good" Eleanor.&nbsp;</p><p>Plot twist! During the argument, Eleanor has an epiphany and things start to get messy. She isn't actually in the Good Place — the neighborhood she lives in is actually the Bad Place disguised as the Good Place, and the four humans were set up there to annoy each other for eternity. When she accuses Michael, he comes clean and reveals that he and all the other residents are actually Bad Place demons. Even the actual good Eleanor is a ruse — she's actually a demon named Vicky. Upset that his secret experiment didn't last, Michael gets permission from his boss to reboot the neighborhood, erase the four humans' memories and try to fool them once again.&nbsp;</p><p>Onto season 2! After the experiment is rebooted, Michael modifies the neighborhood, but the humans quickly realize that they're in the Bad Place once more. He reboots the experiment for the third time, only to fail again. And again. And again, for a grand total of 802 failed attempts. Among these, Mindy St. Claire, a woman who lives alone in a Medium Place separate of the Good and Bad Places reveals that Eleanor has escaped to her house 16 times, often falling in love with Chidi.&nbsp;</p><p>Vicky the demon soon threatens to expose Michael, who was never supposed to get a third chance. Michael offers to join the humans' side and get them to the actual Good Place, saving himself from eternal damnation as well. Eleanor agrees to his plan on the condition that Michael participates in Chidi's ethics lessons.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason's memory has been wiped of his marriage with Janet, and he develops feelings for Tahani. When they struggle with their relationship, Janet, who still vividly remembers, becomes their couples counselor. Her jealousy about Jason causes her to malfunction, leading to errors that threaten the neighborhood. Eleanor encourages Janet to create another human to be her rebound boyfriend, so Janet comes up with Derek, who is extraordinarily primitive and infantile.</p><p>Shawn congratulates Michael on the success of his mental torture neighborhood, and Michael claims to send the humans to the Bad Place for physical torture the next day. However, he then frames Vicky for letting the humans escape on a train, and the six— Michael, Janet, Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani— are safe and alone in the neighborhood. The plan succeeds, but Michael still has no plan to get the humans into the Good Place. They travel through the Bad Place to get to Judge Gen's office, where they decide to test the humans' self-improvement by wiping their memory, saving them from their initial death and tracking their points thereafter.&nbsp;</p><p>And now for season 3! Against the orders of the judge, Michael remains on Earth and sneaks into the lives of all four humans to ensure that their paths intertwine. In Australia, Chidi is working with Simone, a professor, to conduct research on people who have faced near-death experiences. At Michael's urging, after narrowly escaping being hit by a truck, Eleanor looks up one of Chidi's ethics lectures to learn how to become a better person. Her interest piqued, she goes to Australia to meet Chidi and is then convinced to join his experiment. While she's there, she urges Chidi and Simone to confess their romantic feelings for each other. Tahani and Jason also end up going to Australia and joining the study after their own near-death experiences, and quickly bond with Chidi and Eleanor.</p><p>After seeing some worrying events among the humans, Michael and Janet up their control over the humans, setting up a surveillance room and intervening whenever things get the slightest bit messy.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, Chidi and Simone decide that it's time for the study to end. Michael is upset that the humans may not ever interact again, so he decides to sneak into Judge Gen's office and reset his own experiment in hopes that things will go off without a hitch. But as he and Janet are opening a portal to the afterlife, the humans show up and see them, and obviously, have thousands of questions. Michael has no choice but to come clean and explain everything to them. He also sadly tells them that, because they now know about the system, their motivations have been ruined and none of them have a chance of making it to the real Good Place.&nbsp;</p><p>The humans decide to use their new knowledge to help others lead good lives. Thus begins a wild adventure of traveling all over the world. Jason goes to Florida and gains closure with his father, who once inspired his life of crime. Tahani reconciles with her competitive sister. Eleanor goes back home to Arizona and talks to her mother, who has changed for the better since Eleanor's childhood.&nbsp;</p><p>While on Earth, Michael and Janet decide to go visit Doug Forcett, a seemingly angelic human who is famous in the afterlife for correctly predicting everything about the afterlife while high. However, after a trip to the accounting branch of the afterlife, they find out that despite Doug's perfect life, he won't make it to the Good Place. This leads Michael, Janet, and the four humans to the realization that the world has changed so much that a number of outside factors make it almost impossible for a person to actually lead a good life on Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>They meet with Judge Gen in the Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes to beg for the chance to set up a new neighborhood experiment that will help them prove that people can become better without the influence of outside factors. Gen agrees, on the condition that the Bad Place demons get to choose the test subjects. Simultaneously in the IHOP, Jason and Janet begin dating again.</p><p>The four humans officially become Michael's assistants in the afterlife. However, as they set up the new neighborhood and meet their test subjects, the humans quickly realize that the demons chose test subjects specifically to torture the original four. One of them is Simone, Chidi's ex-girlfriend from the Australian study. Chidi makes a grim decision that in order to not skew the experiment, Michael must wipe his memory and treat him as an ordinary resident of the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p><p>In season four, the new, year-long experiment also brings new test subjects— Simone, privileged and conceited Brent, ever-gossiping John, and Linda, later discovered to be a Bad Place demon disguised as an old woman. In response to the Bad Place's illegal interference, Judge Gen officially makes Chidi the fourth test subject.</p><p>Eleanor, Jason, Tahani, and Janet are hard at work to help the test subjects become better people— Tahani overcomes her contempt for John, who used to write insulting articles about her on Earth and Eleanor comes up with a plan to help Brent, who already believes that he's too good for even the Good Place.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the situation turns for the worse as Janet breaks up with Jason and convinces the others that Eleanor is unfit for leadership. Despite being heartbroken, Jason realizes that Janet isn't acting herself— she's really a Bad Janet who swapped places with Good Janet on the afterlife train. Jason and Michael imprison the bad Janet in a void and set off to the Bad Place to rescue the real Good Janet. Months later, to her surprise, Michael releases Bad Janet instead of killing her. He also giving her a copy of the Manifesto documenting his and Good Janet's journey so far.</p><p>All the subjects seem to have made significant personal improvement with the team's efforts, except for Brent. As the year of the experiment ends, Michael opens a sinkhole in the neighborhood and causes Brent to fall in, with the hopes that the other members will save Brent and receive a point boost, but only Chidi stays to help. In the last moments of the experiment, Chidi realizes that they're in the Bad Place, leaving Brent sputtering and regretful, and he apologizes to Chidi for the first time just as the timer is up.</p><p>After the experiment, Michael and Shawn both make their cases to Judge Gen, who rules that the system is unfair and needs to be adjusted. But there's a catch —ut her proposed solution is to wipe Earth's memory and start from scratch, redoing the entire universe. In an attempt to avoid this, Janet hides the reset button for the universe. Bad Janet, swayed by Michael's manifesto, arrives on the scene with an army of Janets. They bounce the reset button between their voids, but time is running out as Judge Gen checks each void and marbelizes each Janet. Eleanor believes Chidi is the only person in the universe ethical enough to determine a better ruling system for the afterlife. With seconds left, Michael reinstates Chidi's memory all the way from birth.</p><p>A lot has happened so far, and there's sure to be even more to dissect as the series comes to a close!

32012	The inaugural event will take place on Sept. 14	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Saturday, Sept. 14, Montgomery Blair High School will be hosting the Red and Blue 5K in partnership with Montgomery County First Responders. The 5K is the first run the school has ever hosted.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The race will start at 8:30 a.m. in front of Blair and wrap up around 11 a.m. in the same spot.&nbsp;Most of the roads that racers will travel on are in the Woodmoor neighborhood (Williamsburg Drive, St Lawrence Drive, Hillmore Drive, and Lexington Drive). The only major road that runners will have to cross is University Boulevard, which will temporarily be closed to traffic.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Registration fees for the event are $15 for students with a valid ID card and $25 for adults. Elementary schoolers can participate in a free fun run on Blair’s track. As of now, there are over 100 people signed up to race; the maximum capacity is 200.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The race was organized to support wellness in the Silver Spring community. All the proceeds will go towards supporting Blair's wellness initiatives, including mental health awareness, promoting mindfulness and Be Well 365, an MCPS program designed to address the well-being of students.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The reason the Montgomery County First Responders stepped in to support is because of the race’s support of wellness. School Resource Officer Sharese Junious and </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">twelfth-grade assistant principal Dr. Nicole Allain</span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> looked at the Silver Spring community and found that many organizations — the fire station right next to Blair, the police station and Blair administration itself&nbsp;- are invested in promoting wellness, so a wellness run was a good opportunity for these organizations to come together.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32011"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Allain helped organize the 5K and outlined the preparations for the race. She and the other organizers (Junious and Dr. Joseph Fanning) started planning last December, then after running into roadblocks, continued for most of the spring and the entire summer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Organizing the run involved getting county and school permission, obtaining permits, shutting down roads and generally ensuring participants' safety. The partnership with the Montgomery County Police and First Responders and other county organizations required going through legal departments, liability and making sure the race was covered by insurance.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Allain said inspiration for the 5K also came from several staff members. “Last year Ms. Johnson developed wellness teams and we participated as a faculty. Some of the staff members participated in a 5K and she thought it would be really good to bring together the Blair community by hosting our own 5K and to have the proceeds go to the wellness initiative BeWell365,” she said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The race is expected to attract first responders, people from the Silver Spring community, Blair alumni and Blair families. If successful, it may become a yearly occurrence. Regardless, the 5K is a healthy and fun way to support Blair and the entire Silver Spring community.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Allain is also looking forward to all of the activities planned for the day. “We’re really excited. We have a very healthy and active community. We're looking really to promote removing the stigma from mental health. A lot of people are coming out and 95.5 (WPGC) will be broadcasting live. There’ll be a lot of fun wellness activities, Gruff the crime dog and opportunities for giveaways. It should be a family fun day,” Allain said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32011
32886	A call to change the underlying issues at Blair.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dear Blair Administrators,</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">My name is Adiba Chowdhury, and I’m reaching out because as an alum of the Class of 2020, I believe that support for marginalized communities in our school system is long overdue. I know in these last few days, many survivors of sexual violence have bravely come forward to share their stories and call for action. My heart goes out to them; like many others, I am lucky to have only experienced street harassment in a world that does not hold perpetrators of assault accountable and that blames their victims.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">That luck may not last when our school directly contributes to the normalization of abuse, and especially so towards people of color. In my opinion, this last week highlights once again that Blair upholds a culture in which only the most privileged flourish, on both an individual and structural level.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">There </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">are</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> individuals who should receive blame in racist and abusive situations; those who commit abhorrent acts of sexual violence are undeniably at the top of that list. They should receive the right consequences, but I would also highlight those that contribute to the development of such situations. These include staff that demean their female students, students and teachers that implicitly and explicitly doubt the abilities of Blair’s students of color, and a principal that blocks students on Twitter for speaking out. (My thoughts on that are available </span><a href="https://twitter.com/adibaachowdhury/status/1276320039776419840?s=20" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.)</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, I believe true accountability only begins when we first recognize the culture and a system that enables such individual actions, and when we address the ways in which we have harmed each other. The trivialization of sexual violence - as in, rape culture - is a part of this. So is the continued prioritization of the choice programs at the expense of students of color. As a OneBlair organizer, I’m incredibly familiar with how Blair continues to give Magnet and CAP students resources, education, and social superiority while hindering the success of Black and Latinx students.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I meet students who have never met people outside of the programs, and some who don’t want to. I see ESOL students segregated from the rest of the building, relying on Chromebook carts and the bare minimum of resources for their education. I know that Black students - and Black women especially - hurt when teachers ignore them in class, refer carelessly to significantly racialized topics, and fail to support them altogether. They have also had to act as teachers themselves, constantly pushing for change and accepting that they may never be heard. I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the work that Black women have done at Blair, including as leaders of OneBlair, the Student Government Association, the Minority Scholars Program, GirlUp, and other clubs. As a Muslim woman and organizer myself, I can personally relate to having to act as the representative of an entire community of people of color, and never getting enough support in return.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In that same vein, the response to such calls for action is deeply disappointing and disheartening. I don’t just mean Principal Johnson blocking students, although that is as well. I mean the way some Blair teachers and students are so used to superiority that they ignored the valid points of a Silver Chips article calling into question the privilege of the choice programs (referring to “Do Cap And Magnet Benefit The Student Body?”) in favor of brushing it aside and leaving it to myself and other OneBlair organizers to attempt building a dialogue. I mean the way sexual harassment and rape culture has been overlooked for years, when female students get catcalled, assaulted, ignored, demeaned, and devalued, as well as failed by a counseling and reporting system that claims to protect them. I mean the way that in the last week, survivors’ requests for change and real improvements to education were ignored in favor of involving the police; while I acknowledge that the Blair administration has rules to follow, and have my own opinions on how police often exacerbate or cause survivors’ trauma, the demands for teaching and creating a culture of consent were completely missed. I mean the way that Magnet teacher Eric Walstein was allowed to retire without having faced consequences for the treatment of women in his classroom. I mean the way Black students’ activism against racism has often been limited or rejected completely. These examples are simply part of a whole environment that left the most marginalized students to suffer while trying to learn.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">That leaves one final question: what </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">does</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> fix the issues at hand?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first and foremost solution I can offer is listening to students. Here are just some of the changes that Blair can implement, based on an </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9twj0HDDYyVpeafxHxipwsAInnGDTqcpkuF-pBDHWU/edit" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">MCPS-wide letter</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> that over 1000 students have signed:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Create safe spaces for survivors to talk about their experiences and receive support from the counseling services. This includes students and staff.”</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Train staff and administrators on how to deal with sexual assault victims and victims of abuse. The current training on reporting and prevention are not working and need to be completely re-imagined.”</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Require education for all [Blair] students on Title IX and its process of reporting. This could be through school assemblies or be a part of syllabuses to ensure that all students receive this information.”</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Amend Health Education curriculums to include more topical areas on consent, LGBTQ+ sex education, Intimate Partner Violence, Healthy Relationships, Trauma, and Sexual Assault through a lens of Intersectionality.”</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">“Have the health curriculum elaborate on safe sex and consent and how consent can be revoked at ANY TIME.”</span></li></ul><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, though in recent days and weeks the issues and concerns of LGBTQ+ survivors and students haven’t been addressed, their struggles too must be realized. I’ve heard my peers use the f slur without shame, even shouting it in the hallways. That goes to show just how few actions have been taken to address homophobia. </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Intersectionality is a key part of the solution.</em></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Listening to students also means responding to and giving them space to share their opinions on racial injustice.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In regards to the aforementioned injustice and the choice programs:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Prioritize empowerment for students of color within the fine arts program, including:</span></li><li class="ql-indent-1"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Extend show dates for Sankofa to 2 weekends to match the fall play and spring musical.</span></li><li class="ql-indent-1"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Develop additional funding, support, and publicity for Fiesta Blair, to allow Blair’s large Spanish-speaking population to express their pride for their culture to a larger audience.</span></li><li class="ql-indent-1"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Emphasize the importance of plays and musicals that incorporate minority students in an empowering way (like </span><em style="background-color: transparent;">In the Heights</em><span style="background-color: transparent;"> and </span><em style="background-color: transparent;">Rent</em><span style="background-color: transparent;">) rather than in an appropriative way (like Blair’s rendition of </span><em style="background-color: transparent;">Tales of 1001 Nights</em><span style="background-color: transparent;">, and </span><em style="background-color: transparent;">Kismet</em><span style="background-color: transparent;">), and hold the directors accountable for casting people of color in roles meant for people of color.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Provide more educational resources for ESOL students, from better technology and increasing the teacher-student ratio to hiring more paraeducators and supporting the Conexiones program.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Encourage and open a dialogue regarding the mental health impact of school, including and especially by emphasizing the importance of mental health in ALL classes and better publicizing and expanding mental health services.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hold staff accountable for prejudiced actions, instead of leaving it on the student to go to the counselor or speak out in general and then doing nothing in the face of repeated and ongoing racial bias.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Acknowledge and address the way the school-to-prison pipeline and in-school disciplinary actions disproportionately affect Black and Latinx students, while Blair’s security staff and teachers allow white and Asian students to do the same actions without consequences.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Hold the uncomfortable conversations required to address the culture and structure of privilege given to the choice programs, as well as racial injustice in general, through Study Circles and school-wide events.</span></li><li class="ql-indent-1"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Address the unacceptable use of the n word by white teachers and the need for diverse book choices in the English department.</span></li><li class="ql-indent-1"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Actively bring together Magnet, CAP, and Academy students to strengthen student unity.</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Expand and publicize access to AP and Magnet classes to students not in either program.</span></li><li class="ql-indent-1"><span style="background-color: transparent;">Can be done by individual actions, like within meetings with counselors.</span></li></ul><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I hope you read this letter as a sincere request for change. I must also acknowledge that I reach a wider platform because I am often perceived as more eloquent (and Black people are stereotyped as "ghetto-sounding"); I would expect that the people of color who know the aforementioned examples better than myself be asked for their opinion before my own. Lastly, I know that the current pandemic may make it harder to address all of these issues, even as the impact of the coronavirus exacerbates inequality in education, but that does not serve as an excuse. I’ve had experiences, taken classes, made friends, and gained memories from Blair that I will always cherish.

32320	The film is only for history fanatics and those looking to celebrate veterans	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With Veteran’s Day on Nov. 11, the release of “Midway” comes at a perfect time. Veterans and their families were likely excited to hit theaters opening night, looking to honor the soldiers who fought in the Battle of Midway and those who protect us today. But did anyone leave theaters with the same excitement?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Set on the Pacific Coast, "Midway" focuses on the World War II interactions between the United States and Japan. The war originally started as a conflict between Japan and China, with the U.S. remaining neutral. Japan provoked the US by bombing Pearl Harbor, leading to a seven month battle for control of the Pacific waterways.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Japan attempts to attack U.S. military base Midway, but intelligence officer Lieutenant-Commander Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) warns his superiors — Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) and Vice Admiral William "Bull" Halsey (Dennis Quaid) — beforehand. This vital intel gives the US an advantage as they have time to plan for the attack. Lieutenant Richard "Dick" Best (Ed Skrein) distinguishes himself by taking out two of the four Japanese aircraft carriers, contributing to ultimate US victory.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The film is an honorable show of appreciation, but in individual categories it falls just short of success. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is a reflection of history, but at times the history feels forced. Characters speak in historical context, making oddly specific statements like, “We get 30 percent of our oil from your country.” The bombardment of statistics takes away from the general narrative; it makes the dialogue seem as though it was pulled directly from a textbook. Even though it is essential in certain scenarios, it’s overbearing on the whole.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Most of the characters are unimportant in the overall plot and the large cast’s interactions make the movie hard to follow. Teens may be quick to recognize Bruno Gaido (Nick Jonas), but his role underscores another failure of the movie: accents. Every character sounds like an English man with a heavy New York accent, seeming more exaggerated than historic.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The film's design is also lackluster. It is reminiscent of a combination of a modern-day online gaming world and and the old images in a textbook. It would be unreasonable to expect the directors to stage a real battle in the middle of the ocean, but the computer-generated imagery (CGI) looks a little too artificial.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After watching, there are no moments that stand out as exemplary. The characters are one-dimensional, the musical score is quickly forgotten, and the cinematography is subpar. The film had so much potential, but it unfortunately fell short.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The only thing “Midway” does well is humanizing the war and making it hit closer to home. For those of us who weren’t alive to experience any global tragedies, the film highlights that death is more than just a number.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many parts of the film reflect overarching themes of revenge, empathy and love. The simple act of Best chewing a piece of gum before flying his plane to destroy to Japanese fleet, for example, brings the shocking realization that soldiers are people at the core.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ultimately, Midway does achieve one incredibly important goal. It is dedicated to the heroes of the battle, a monumental event in U.S. history. The U.S. could not have won the Battle of Midway without the effort of all the historical figures celebrated in the film.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To people who are going into the theater to see a historical moment and celebrate soldiers this Veteran’s Day, this might be exactly what you had in mind. But for everyone else, learn about the history at home.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Midway” is rated PG-13 for gruesome battle footage, some explicit language and smoking. It is playing at Regal Majestic &amp; IMAX,&nbsp;AMC Wheaton Mall 9 and Regal Rockville Center.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>	32319
31699	Harper signs record deal to stay in the NL East	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Bryce Harper finally got paid. According to</span><a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26105394/sources-phillies-finalizing-deal-harper" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"> reports</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, The former National is joining the Phillies on a 13-year, $330 million contract, with no opt-outs and a full no trade clause. Harper, a 26-year old outfielder, is now the highest paid player in the MLB, surpassing Giancarlo Stanton's $325 million dollar deal which he received last year from the Marlins. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Harper patiently waited four months to make his decision with lots of twists and turns along the way. The Phillies were the favorite from the start of the offseason, but many believed that he was more inclined to play for a team on the west coast, near his hometown of Las Vegas. Over the last few weeks, reports indicated that the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants had crept into the conversation, but both were outbid by Philadelphia.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Over his seven year MLB career, Harper has racked up several accolades. He’s made six All-Star teams, won Rookie of the Year in 2012, and has one MVP award (2015) to his credit. Last year was not his best, finishing with a .249 batting average with 34 home runs (courtesy of</span><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/harpebr03.shtml" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"> Baseball Reference</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Overall, this is a massive signing for the Phillies who were in desperate need of a superstar to round off their 2019 lineup.&nbsp;Even after trading for all-star C J.T. Realmuto and inking CF Andrew McCutchen to a three year deal, the Phillies wanted to get Harper to complete a successful offseason.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With these moves, the team is immediately vaulted to the front of the NL East and may even have a shot at the World Series. "Bryce is a franchise altering player," Phillies manager Gabe Kapler said to </span><a href="https://www.philly.com/phillies/bryce-harper-phillies-signed-mlb-contract-gabe-kapler-aaron-nola-20190228.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Philly.com</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> upon hearing the news. "He is tailor made for our team." </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Other Phillies players expressed their excitement about Harper going to Philadelphia. Pitcher Aaron Nola spoke on the future of the team after a spring training game on Thursday." It's exciting. He's a superstar player. We were already a better team without him, but now that we got him it takes it up a notch," he </span><a href="https://www.philly.com/phillies/bryce-harper-phillies-signed-mlb-contract-gabe-kapler-aaron-nola-20190228.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">said</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nobody knows how good the Phillies will actually be, but what is for certain is that they will be much improved from their 80-82 season last year. Harper is just scratching the surface as a player and he'll get a chance to shine alongside a young core in Philadelphia.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31698
32090	Breaking down the Major League Baseball postseason	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It's early October, which can only mean one thing to baseball fans: postseason baseball. This season has been an exciting one, with some really strong teams emerging. But which will be the last team standing? Let's take a look at the playoff picture, and I'll give you my predictions.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NL Wildcard Game: Milwaukee Brewers at Washington Nationals</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Nationals have made it to the postseason despite a tough start to the season, and are entering this home game with eight straight wins. On the other hand, the Brewers have been looking strong all season, especially in the past month. I think the Nationals are going to take this one at home, thanks to some strong starting pitching from Max Scherzer. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Nationals</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NL Division Series: St. Louis Cardinals at Atlanta Braves</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Cardinals are a great team that earned a very respectable record in the best division in baseball. Their core is talented and exciting, and have proven that they can play well when it matters most. However, the same can be said about the Braves. Centerfielder Ronald Acuña is a certified star, and the infielder core is the best in the MLB. I'm going to take the Braves here because they have a much better starting rotation, and a good rotation is crucial in series. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Braves</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NL Division Series: Washington Nationals at Los Angeles Dodgers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All season, there has been a prophecy surrounding the Dodgers. Everyone expects them to go to the World Series: their starting pitching is good, their players are young but experienced, and Dave Roberts is an amazing manager. This team won't disappoint in the division series against a Nationals team with a struggling bullpen. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Dodgers</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NL Championship Series: Atlanta Braves at Los Angeles Dodgers</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">These teams are very evenly matched. Both have decent rotations, good position players, and mediocre bullpens. It's really a tossup to pick a winner here, and I think this match-up has the potential to go through all seven games. I’ll have to go with LA here due to their stronger regular season performance. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Dodgers</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">AL Wildcard Game: Tampa Bay Rays at Oakland Athletics</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Tampa Bay was the team to beat early on in the season, but have been underwhelming since then. On the other hand, the A's played well all season, thanks to some great play from the rotation and star third baseman Matt Chapman. I simply can't pick the Rays here—they're too new to the scene. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Athletics</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">AL Division Series: Oakland Athletics at Houston Astros</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Oakland has been playing well all year, but the Astros have been far better. The Astros have retained the same core from 2017, and they have the best pitching in the league. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Astros</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">AL Division Series: Minnesota Twins at New York Yankees</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This will be the most competitive out of the four division series. The Twins are very talented and underrated, while the Yankees are simply dominant. On paper, the Yankees are better. But the Twins played this season with so much energy and excitement that it's hard not to pick them here. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Twins</strong></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">AL Championship Series: Minnesota Twins at Houston Astros</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This series will display the Twins' inexperience. I don't foresee the Twins being able to hold up against the lethal combo of Verlander, Cole and Greinke. On the flip side, I think the Astros' batters will be able to hit well against the average Twins pitching. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Astros</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">World Series: Los Angeles Dodgers at Houston Astros</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This rematch of the 2017 World Series might be even more exciting. The Dodgers have many young and talented position players, led by right fielder Cody Bellinger. On the other hand, the Astros have one of the best rotations baseball has ever seen and a talented crew of batters to back their pitchers up. In this battle of titans, I predict that the Dodgers will get their hearts broken yet again, and lose to the out-of-this-world Houston team. </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Winner: Astros</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p>	32089
32962	While the government debates Chinese surveillance activity on the platforms, Chinese-Americans wonder what the ban will mean for their communication	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sunday, Sept. 27, District of Columbia District Judge Carl Nichols granted a </span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/injunction" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">preliminary injunction</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> against President Trump's executive order to ban the popular viral video app TikTok on US app stores. Nichol's court order requires Trump to halt his order due to the potential harm it may cause. Trump’s order to begin prohibiting TikTok's download was scheduled for that same night. While TikTok won the reprieve, its success is temporary—the ruling does not address the broader ban planned for implementation on Nov. 12.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lawyers for TikTok claimed an infringement on freedom of speech by relating the ban to&nbsp;proximity to the next presidential election. TikTok lawyer </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/technology/tiktok-ban-ruling-app.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">John Hall stated to the New York Times</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that banning the app would "be no different from the government locking the doors to a public forum" that 120 million Americans use regularly. In the context of a pandemic, the company argued that banning TikTok would bar potential users from expressing their political views.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Iris Gupta reasoned that Trump also may have used TikTok to make headlines during election season. "I figured that TikTok would not shut down because it's a huge platform—it seems unlikely that Trump would shut down such a profitable platform. I felt like it was a diversion from focusing on other more important issues," Gupta said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Ben Broderick-Sokol agreed that banning TikTok was a low priority issue that would not come to fruition. "I saw [the TikTok ban] and was like, okay that probably won't happen. TikTok shouldn't be one of those things Trump focuses on during this time. I think it could be a feeble attempt to demonstrate authority or power," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">TikTok's reprieve follows a week after a similar injunction granted by Judge Laurel Beeler of California, which blocked Trump's executive order banning WeChat from app stores. Both TikTok and the Chinese messaging app WeChat have been targets of the Trump administration since August, when the president initially ordered for the apps' removal under the impression that they are a threat to national security.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32961"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As Chinese companies ByteDance and Tencent Holdings own TikTok and WeChat respectively, President Trump stated that the wide usage of such apps in the United States allows for collection of data on American users and Chinese censorship. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/20/business/economy/court-wechat-ban.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Beeler highlights two main contentions as rebuttal</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">: the ban raises concerns over an infringement of First Amendment rights and halts a main platform for overseas communication within the Chinese community.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Jennifer Li articulated the main concerns of the Chinese-American community with regards to the WeChat ban. "I use WeChat to chat with family, mainly my grandparents. I also have a lot of group [chats] for friends I met in China and a couple for dance. Last Friday and Saturday all my WeChat groups were going crazy trying to figure out what to do [about the ban], because a bunch of American apps are blocked," Li said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gupta added that while privacy may be a concern, banning TikTok was unnecessary. "I have heard of privacy issues, but there are other ways to tighten security. A pretty good solution is if TikTok was under an American company. Then, there would be no reason to shut it down," she said. TikTok has yet to make concrete plans with American company Oracle, which may hold a stake in the company in the future.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">TikTok's and WeChat's availability in U.S. app stores ultimately remains unknown, but the companies are working with American companies to potentially come to a consensus. As the Trump administration pushes its plan to completely ban the apps, the hundreds of millions of users reliant on the platforms for communication and expression represent the weight of such a decision.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32961
32747	While reposting information is an easy way to express support and awareness for global issues, let us consider its efficacy and credibility	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When we hear the term ‘activism’ at Blair, we tend to imagine protests, walk-outs and fundraisers promoted by various clubs. While these activities are regularly pursued by a small, passionate group of people, a larger population of students and social media users in general have begun to raise awareness for pressing current issues by reposting on Instagram Stories and retweeting information online.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With 2020 starting off with a chaotic combination of war, epidemic and environmental issues, students have become more involved in sharing posts that inform readers about current events. They spread awareness through Twitter, Instagram, and other social media on various disasters around the world—think Australian wildfires, Chinese concentration camps and coronavirus.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32746"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With a few simple taps of the thumb, students can share information regarding these topics, whether it be a text post or a video from a primary source, to their following and contribute to spreading awareness. It's easy—suspiciously so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Let's stop for a second and think about this so-called "social media activism." What effect does reposting information really have? It spreads awareness, but will it excite your audience to act on the cause? What about the reposter: do they really feel impassioned to take action after sharing a post, or did they do it to appear 'woke' about current events?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In-person activism allows dedicated people who are truly passionate about an issue to focus on bringing about change. In comparison, the two seconds it takes to repost information lacks the emotion and passion demonstrated at protests and marches. Without a specific call for action on these posts, readers won't feel engaged with the issue or be compelled to do anything about it on their own—it's not social media activism at all. "The awareness is really important, but what's the next step? It doesn't stop there. Promote action," senior Sky Bloomer says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even just reposting information online has its downsides: the post may not have a credible source and&nbsp;the information may be inaccurate, oversimplified and/or politically skewed. Reposting these would ultimately spread misinformation and worsen the situation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Lara Ojha expresses concern on the oversimplification that is customary on social media. "You assume the person knows about the issue. You are implying certain things and telling them to feel some way. Social media activism isn't dangerous - it's really powerful, but the lack of context makes it dangerous," she says. A politically skewed or blatantly inaccurate post may urge viewers to formulate misinformed opinions.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ojha and Bloomer also state that spreading awareness through social media is limited to a person's followers and the people the post reaches. "Your voice is limited to your following: it has nothing to do with your credibility - it's out of your control," Ojha says. "On social media, credentials are sketchy and legitimacy is a real question." Social media users can be easily swayed by accounts with an abundance of followers or reject smaller accounts that may have more credibility.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sharing opinions on private accounts also reinforces social media echo chambers, as the information travels to friends and acquaintances who may share similar ideas and preferences. "It's just their own friend group and community that follows them, so it's like, you're not doing much except you're informing people who are probably already informed," Bloomer says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Assuming that sources are credible and information is accurate, social media is a platform that gives students the opportunity to voice their opinions. Posts that are directly associated with in-person action are beneficial because their main focus is to promote activism outside of social media. "Something I've taken advantage of is an issue I personally am passionate about; I try and help where I can, and I've posted about LGBT issues when people don't know what a term, or what an issue is," says senior Kasey Hammond. Whether it be advertising and promoting in-person events to increase attendance and participation or asking for donations, social media is a reliable platform to reach a large number of supporters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, think twice about what's on social media before hitting that repost button. Go further than just spreading information—excite the audience, urge them to attend an event and utilize social media's unique platform to promote action. Maybe then, retweeting or reposting information can actually make a difference.</span></p>	32746
32660	The team volunteered at A Wider Circle over winter break.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This winter season, the wrestling team has been on fire, with a 24 - 2 winning record. Wrestlers are not only performing well in wrestling matches but also sharing some of that success with the less fortunate through volunteering at a local nonprofit.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The team volunteered at A Wider Circle, an organization dedicated to helping the impoverished through employment assistance, neighborhood revitalization and proving those in need with furniture and other goods that may be difficult to access. Blair wrestlers spent one day over the holiday break to sort out donated commodities and move other heavy goods. "We were in there sorting sofas, putting them onto their display cabinets, moving TVs or sorting out and cleaning kitchen supplies or appliances, which can be reused and given to people who might not be able to buy them for themselves," senior team captain Elias Chen says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Coach Tim Grover organized a day for the teammates to volunteer at an organization for the past three years. He initially hoped to go to a different charity each year, but that proved to be difficult with the size of the group. "Ideally I wanted to rotate through a couple of different charities from year to year. But I found that that's actually been more of a challenge than I expected. A lot of nonprofits are smaller and they definitely need help, but not necessarily in the form of 70 people showing up for a few hours," Grover says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Grover hopes that the work the wrestlers do will help them be more thankful for their own lives. "I think it helps our wrestlers stay a bit more grounded about how lucky they are and to be thankful for what they have and keep things in perspective. Losing a wrestling match might be devastating at the time. But then if you can kind of put it in the context that you're at a great school and getting a great education, maybe a losing wrestling match is not so bad," Grover says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The wrestlers take that lesson to heart, paying attention to what they learn volunteering. "Seeing the stuff that people don't have that we take for granted like, like a couch or a mattress really drives the hardships that are going on around you that you don't even notice," junior wrestler Brian McCaw says. The experience also opened the wrestlers' eyes to how many people in the community are disadvantaged. "I didn't know how many people are in need around this area. I'm so used to looking around with everyone dressed up and when you go there, it's a whole different world. It changes your perspective," senior captain Mervin Mancia says. Volunteering also made the teammates realize how they could help those less fortunate with what they have. "It really gives you another dimension of how the gifts, physical and mental, that you have been given can be applied to help those around you," Chen says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32659"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The team not only helped those in need, but had fun and bonded during their volunteer work . "Besides working with the poor, we had a lot of fun out there because we got to talk and we got to do everything together. It was just a really good, fun experience," McCaw says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Along with the coach, the wrestlers also feel it is important to give back to the community as someone on the Blair wrestling team. "When you're a member of the wrestling team, there's a responsibility not just that you're an athlete, but that you're building strong character. If you can utilize the skills you have on the mat off the mat, that's what really makes you a good wrestler and not just a good athlete, but a good person," Chen says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair wrestlers not only believe it is their responsibility to volunteer, but see the opportunity for other sports teams to volunteer as well."If wrestling, which has the longest and toughest season of any sport, can take a day out of their season to go help a community service organization, every team can do it. This is a great way to really take those values and help people," Chen says. "It shows you that sports is bigger than just sports and it shows you that you need to help the community and get to know what's going on," McCaw says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ultimately, the wrestlers hope they can make a positive impact on the local community through volunteering as a team."Having a team show up in our uniforms, I think it shows the people in the community that Blair is here and there are a lot of good things happening with our high school," Grover says.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Editor's note: Elias Chen is the Features editor for Silver Chips Print.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32659
33078	The Baltimore-based sportswear company is partnering with local hospital systems to produce and distribute protective equipment	<p>Under Armour has started to produce face shields, fabric face masks, and “specially equipped fanny packs” to donate to local Maryland hospitals in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The sportswear company, headquartered in Baltimore, is also exploring the production of hospital gowns and N-95 face masks.</p><p>In Maryland, the need for medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary to prevent the spread of the virus is greater than ever. The state received only one third of face shields, respirator masks, and surgical masks that it requested from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), according to a report issued by the House Oversight and Reform Committee on March 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Under Armour is partnering with the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), which oversees 13 hospitals, and Life Bridge, a non-profit healthcare organization in Baltimore. They are also in discussion with other local hospitals such as Johns Hopkins Medicine and MedStar.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33077"></div><p>Under Armour has been collaborating coast to coast to produce and design medical equipment. “More than 50 Under Armour teammates, from materials scientists to footwear and apparel designers from laboratories in Baltimore and Portland quickly came together in search of solutions,” Randy Harward, Senior Vice President of Advanced Material and Manufacturing Innovation, wrote in an Under Armour press release. "When the call came in from our local medical providers for more masks, gowns and supply kits, we just went straight to work."&nbsp;</p><p><span style="color: black;">After Harward listened to an interview with an Italian doctor emphasizing the need for masks, the Under Armour team focused on designing a mask that could be mass-produced quickly. The team chose a simple design that folds as opposed to one that requires sewing in the manufacturing process. Because of the design, machines are able to cut 100 pieces of fabric at once and produce 100,000 masks a week.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Twenty-thousand of these masks were delivered to the Johns Hopkins health system on April 6. After their arrival, 50 volunteers folded and sorted the masks, which reached non clinical staff and patients just two days later.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Johns Hopkins, which also conducts COVID-19 research, expressed gratitude to Under Armour for the donation. "As we move to ensure that everyone at Johns Hopkins Medicine has an adequate supply, we are so thankful for support from local businesses and community groups,” </span><a href="https://www.blogger.com/u/4/blog/post/edit/3035589981066893120/6796782867726090279#" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Paul Rothman</a><span style="color: black;">, dean of the medical faculty and CEO of Johns Hopkins Medicine, said to Johns Hopkins’ News Center.</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Under Armour has also donated 1,300 face shields to UMMS, and is expected to donate 500,000 fabric face masks, 1,000 other face shields, and 50,000 “specially equipped fanny packs,” which will include supplies for a type of personal preparedness kit for frontline medical professionals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">“We are incredibly grateful for Under Armour’s investment in our health care workers, patients, and each Marylander working hard to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” Mohan Suntha, President and CEO of UMMS, said in a news release. “Their willingness and ability to immediately pivot their manufacturing focus to help meet our personal protective equipment (PPE) needs will save lives.”</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">UMMS adopted a “universal masking policy” in early April, which means that everyone in the hospitals, even non-clinical staff, need a form of personal protective equipment upon entrance into the facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">“Having the right equipment makes all the difference in caring for patients and keeping the hospital operational,” UMMS said in a statement. “We appreciate Under Armour’s shared commitment to community, and this partnership will be instrumental in Maryland addressing COVID-19.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Under Armour is also exploring producing medical gowns for patients and N-80 and N-95 masks for doctors and nurses on the front lines.</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">All of the equipment is being designed at Under Armour’s “Lighthouse,” a design innovation think tank in Baltimore.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">“I’m incredibly proud of the quick thinking and hard work of all our Under Armour teammates as we work with health care professionals to strengthen our community—teamwork has proven to be key,” Paul Frisk, CEO of Under Armour said in a press release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>	33077
32286	Female athletes should be paid equal to their male counterparts	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Thursday, Oct. 24, the Washington Mystics won their first Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) championship by defeating the Connecticut Sun 89-78 in Game 5 of the Finals. Traditionally, a parade would be held the following weekend to honor and celebrate their success over the season. Unfortunately, this will not happen until next spring.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Meager wages are forcing the team to seek additional revenue overseas and their contracts require them to be there just a couple days after their win. In fact, more than half of WNBA players spend their summers in Europe playing a second basketball season for higher pay and more recognition. And despite a full year season, the pay is still less than a typical National Basketball Association (NBA) athlete.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32285"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In July, the United States women's national soccer team (USWNT) shared the same degree of success, winning</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"> </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">its fourth consecutive World Cup title with a 2-0 victory over the Netherlands. These continuous accolades give the team more recognition than the United States men’s national soccer team (USMNT). However, the issue remains the same: the USWNT is still paid less than the USMNT, regardless of their increased success.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With female athletics gaining prominence, there is an increasing discussion regarding the disparity between how male and female athletes are treated. Gender discrimination and bias confines the prosperity of a woman paving a career in sports.&nbsp;Female athletes are objectified by fans, commentators, and even coaches. They have to deal with sexist comments, coming especially from men, who think they aren’t strong or talented enough to perform well.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The biggest frustration for female athletes, however, is the inequality of pay between genders. Being the most easily quantifiable, it is also the easiest issue to solve. And the solution is simple: for an equal amount of effort, male and female athletes should be paid equally.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The average salary for a WNBA player is around $70,000. Rookies start with payments as low as $40,000, which is $20,000 lower than the median income in US households. Veterans reach a cap of approximately $120,000. In stark contrast, male NBA athletes are </span><a href="https://heavy.com/sports/2019/05/nba-player-average-salary-how-much-highest-paid/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">earning in the millions</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;The maximum salary in the WNBA is nearly six-and-a-half times less than the NBA minimum.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As reported by sports salary website </span><a href="https://www.spotrac.com/wnba/washington-mystics/yearly/cap/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Spotrac</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, seven Mystics players make less than $70,000 and several make less than $50,000. WNBA Finals MVP Emma Meeseman, whose Mystics salary is $117,500 annually, will be traveling to Russia to play in the EuroLeague, where player salaries start at $100,000. These overseas leagues pay women over 15 times what they receive from the WNBA, which is an atrocious reflection on the United States.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Female athletes are paid less for various reasons. The WNBA generates less revenue and receives less money through its NBA broadcasts deal. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidberri/2018/09/04/what-wnba-players-want/#4a7ba65e33eb" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Forbes reports</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that the NBA pays its players about 50 percent of league revenue, while WNBA players receive less than 25 percent of the revenue. This deal should be amended. It wrongly reflects the performance and dedication of female athletes, and does not justify the lower payment.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Additionally, WNBA teams have a shorter season; they play 34 games in a season for about four and a half months if they don’t make the playoffs. By comparison, NBA teams play 82 games in the regular season for six months while the finals can stretch the season another two months. However, the salaries of female athletes are not even a sixth of what comparable male athletes are earning.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The shorter season is what takes WNBA players overseas for another basketball season. Playing for both leagues year round has a major downside: there’s no time to rest. The shorter season in the WNBA actually extends the basketball season for female athletes to the entire year. Yet, the pay once again does not reflect their time and effort.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the other hand, sophomore Leela Mehta-Harwitz believes that pay should be based on viewership. “Honestly, pay should be proportional to the revenue they are bringing in,” Mehta-Harwitz says. Male sports get more viewers, and viewership is where the money lies. This is unfair because hypothetically, a female athlete putting in 110 percent effort compared to the 80 percent effort that a male athlete puts in still be paid less than the male athlete.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In sports salaries overall, female athletes are left in the dust by their male counterparts. In the 2019 Forbes </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/athletes/#279c320a55ae" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">list</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> of the 100 highest paid athletes in the world, there is only one woman: tennis star Serena Williams. She sits at position 63, with earnings of 29.2 million. This is no surprise to fans of female athletics, but it is extremely disappointing.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The pay disparity issue highlights the contrasting view of male and female sports on the whole. Male athletes have increased popularity, prominence and wealth. Female athletes are held to an elevated standard, and are expected to behave a certain way.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Anika Dasgupta recalls the infamous United States vs. Thailand women’s soccer finals, where the U.S. team defeated Thailand 13-0. Instead of being applauded, they were criticized for being too aggressive. “And while I do feel bad for Thailand, it is the US women’s team’s job to do their best. And if the men had scored 13-0, they never would’ve gotten the same criticism,” Dasgupta says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This comment highlights a difference in behavioural expectations of male and female athletes. Aggression coming from female athletes is discouraged, while fights among male athletes gets America riled up and excited. Athletes are paid for their hard work, and people applaud male athletes for “trashing” their opponents.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Reform is necessary so that the public holds male and female athletes under the same light. The first step is equal pay. For an equal amount of effort, there is no reason that male and female athletes should not be paid the same.&nbsp;</span></p>	32285
32008	The College Board's attempts to address testing inequity have not been enough.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the morning of Saturday, August 24, 2019, students across the country took the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), a standardized test that many American colleges and universities require or consider when reviewing applicants. Others took SAT Subject Tests, admissions exams that test students' knowledge on specific subject areas.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although not all schools require applicants to submit standardized test scores, many do, and nearly all take scores into consideration when reviewing applicants, even if they're not required. "Only about five percent of the four-year regionally accredited colleges in the U.S. News Best Colleges universe say they don't use the SAT or ACT in admissions," </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/college-rankings-blog/2008/09/22/about-that-nacac-report-on-the-sat" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">U.S. News</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> reported.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Because test scores can often play a large role in whether or not a student gets into a school, there is a lot of stress surrounding standardized tests, and pressure to do well on them.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Upper-class students automatically have an advantage when it comes to this aspect of college admissions because they can afford prep books, private tutors, and other study resources that cost money. This is unfair to lower-class students, whose chances of getting into college go down simply because they can't afford the same SAT prep materials as wealthier students.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The College Board redesigned the SAT in 2014 to make it more fair by testing more basic vocabulary and more straightforward math concepts in order to cater to students of all backgrounds. In his speech explaining the thought process behind this revamping, David Coleman, the President of the College Board, admitted that the old version tested concepts that were irrelevant to success in college and that its design allowed wealthy students to do better than less privileged students. He hoped to change that with the new SAT.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32007"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, the new version is still unfair. The price listed on the College Board's website to register to take the test is $49.50. To take it with the essay, an optional portion of the exam that some colleges and universities require, costs an additional $15. The College Board's Question-and-Answer (QAS) service is $18 more. To buy the Board's official SAT prep book, it costs $29.99.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There is a fee waiver made available by the College Board for high school students that meet any of the Board's requirements, including but not limited to: enrollment in or eligibility to participate in the National School Lunch Program and enrollment in a federal, state or local program that aids students from low-income families.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The fee waiver covers the costs of the SAT with or without the essay, and the costs of three Subject Tests taken in one day. This feature of the waiver can be used twice. It also provides two free QAS or Student Answer Service reports, as well as unlimited score reports among other benefits.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This seems like a great plan that should serve to even the playing field, except for the fact that students are allowed to take the SAT an unlimited number of times, and the College Board will store the most recent six. So, in theory, a wealthy student could take it 20 times trying to improve their score. A lower-class student using the fee waiver, on the other hand, only has two tries.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If a student is using a fee waiver, it also limits their opportunities to superscore their SAT. Superscoring is the process where colleges look at the highest score that a student received on each section of the test, Math and Reading &amp; Writing (R&amp;W), across all tests they've taken, and combine them for the total score. For example, if a student took the SAT twice, and got a 700 on the Math section and a 600 in R&amp;W the first time, but got a 600 in Math and a 700 in R&amp;W the second time, their superscore would be a 1400.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Not all colleges superscore, but many do. It's a process that's especially helpful to students who only want to focus on one section of the SAT at a time, and can afford to take it a minimum of two times. But it's unfair to lower-class students who can only take it once or twice and therefore have fewer chances to improve their superscore, and their overall score without superscoring.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students using a fee waiver who decide to take Subject Tests only get six tries. Many schools require or recommend that applicants take two or three Subject Tests. If a student decides to take three, but doesn't do as well as they'd hoped on them and wants to retake them, or decides to try taking a different Subject Test, they have limited opportunities to do so, especially since all three Subject Tests must be taken in one day for students using a waiver.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Being forced to take this many Subject Tests in one day can also be detrimental to students' scores. Each Subject Test is one-hour long, and according to the </span><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/30/22/7664" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Journal of Neuroscience</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, it is difficult for teenagers to concentrate on a task because their brains aren't fully-developed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fortunately, according to the </span><a href="https://www.nacacnet.org/globalassets/documents/publications/research/2018_soca/soca18.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">2018 State of College Admission Report</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> from the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC), only 6.6 percent of colleges find SAT Subject Test scores of "considerable importance" when reviewing applications. However, these scores are still required at nearly all elite schools, such as the Ivy's. Not to mention that the fee waiver doesn't cover everything, including the costs of changing test-taking dates or locations.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The SAT is inherently biased towards wealthy students that have the resources to better prepare for the test, take it as many times as needed and spread out their test dates as much as they want. The College Board has attempted to address this inequity, but more work still needs to be done.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Post-secondary education can change the course of a person's life. It isn't right that someone shouldn't be able to pursue this education simply because they didn't have enough money to get a good score on a standardized test.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32007
32894	Blazers support a mix of virtual and in-person learning for Blair's reopening.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On July 10, MCPS formally proposed two different models for reopening schools in the fall. The county said that the document is just a draft of the final plan, which will be sent to the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) in early August.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The first model for the fall is a blend of virtual and in-school learning, and the second is only virtual learning. MCPS also included sample schedules for elementary, middle, and high school students, as well as a list of health and safety practices that schools must follow during the school year.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Families that wish to keep their children at home for virtual learning instead of sending them to in-person classes would have the opportunity to choose virtual learning only.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This followed a </span><a href="https://novisurvey.net/ns/TakeSurveyPage.aspx?s=9277534bc313417ebf9915378e952243&amp;tsid=7567ccf5adea49fa99ba7ff1f6c8a29f&amp;c=en-US" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">survey </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">released on June 25 asking for parent feedback on different options for the school district’s reopening in the fall. The survey asked parents about their students' access to the internet and devices for online learning. Parents could voice their opinion on what schools should focus on when they reopen, such as physical health, equity of opportunity, and social needs.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MCPS initially looked at three models for reopening schools: continuing with virtual online learning, combining virtual online and in-person learning, and reopening schools completely with some restrictions such as social distancing.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Earlier that month, the MSDE published its </span><a href="http://marylandpublicschools.org/newsroom/Documents/MSDERecoveryPlan.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Recovery Plan for Education</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, which requires that local school systems post their reopening plans online by August 14. This will give teachers and students an idea of what a typical school day looks like. Maryland's plan also listed </span><a href="http://marylandpublicschools.org/newsroom/Documents/MSDERecoveryPlan.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">13 requirements </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">for the reopening of schools, which included safety protocols from the CDC and a guide to achieving equity in education.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">By the time that MCPS published the draft of its plan to reopen schools, over 55,000 parents/guardians had completed the survey.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MCPS has asked parents to submit feedback on the draft. This can be done by going to </span><a href="http://www.mcpssubmitfeedback.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">http://www.mcpssubmitfeedback.org/</a></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32877"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While MCPS did not include plans to restart student athletics, the MDSE recommended that each school district create a committee that uses guidance from the state to regulate school athletics in the fall.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair Principal Renay Johnson elaborated that students will soon be able to start team practices for fall sports. "I talked to Ms. Boule [Blair's athletic director] and she said that right now we are scheduled to have fall sports start on August 12. I know we will have to be within the requirements of health and safety guidelines, but I'm hoping we can manage it," Johnson said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sports are just one issue that Johnson and her administrative team have considered about reopening Blair. The most significant one has been the school's population.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair's 3400 students present a significant challenge in reopening the school this coming fall. For senior Gabriel Argueta, having a mix of in-person and online learning seemed like the best option for Blair. "I am absolutely in agreement with the option to have a mix of online and in-person classes because it avoids the problem of having too many people at school," said Argueta.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rising junior Lauren Berley agreed that a mix of both in-person and online learning would be best, and questioned whether it would be safe for students to return to school completely. "I would love to go back to school and have it be normal, but it's not realistic or the best for the health of the students since Blair is such a big school," Berley said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While MCPS said that it would enforce social distancing measures if students returned to school, Berley and Argueta were both dubious that students would follow these rules. "I don't know how social distancing would work considering that Blair is already overcrowded," Berley said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Johnson echoed that keeping students apart would be difficult. "The greatest challenge will be to keep them apart. Teens do what teens do best. They test the limits, but they also like each other and they haven't seen each other for a long time," Johnson said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Steve Amonles, a rising junior, said that he would like to have in-person classes a few times a week because he has missed seeing familiar faces. "Going to school is great because you can socialize with your friends," Amonles said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While these Blazers agreed that returning to school part-time in the fall would be the best for students, they had mixed experiences regarding MCPS's attempt at online learning in the late 2019-2020 schoolyear.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Amonles enjoyed the freedom of at-home learning and found himself being more productive than he had been at school. "By learning at home, I can make my own schedule and I have a lot of time to do my homework," Amonles said</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Berley, on the other hand, found learning course material online challenging. "For chem, it was really difficult for me not to have any face-to-face meetings because while teachers had the choice to have Zoom classes, many didn't," Berley said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Johnson acknowledged that online learning will have to be revamped for the fall. "I know there were some complaints from parents across the county last spring about students not having a rigorous experience, so we really want to make sure that we up the rigor and have students and teachers meet more synchronously than asynchronously if at all possible," Johnson said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Argueta's experience with at-home learning was uneventful, but he said that Blair responded well to the COVID-19 health crisis. "I think that the school reacted well as they closed the school before there were a lot of cases," Argueta said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As MCPS moves to make its decision on how the school year will look this fall, the health needs of students and their families will be balanced with students' desire to see their classmates and teammates in the fall. Berley hopes that MCPS refines its online learning and gives more specific guidelines for its teachers on how to teach with it. "I would say [to MCPS] be intentional and specific in whatever decision you are making. If we are at home we actually need to be able to learn instead of just getting busywork until the end of the school year."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32877

31917	Blair students respond to Walt Whitman students’ racist incident	<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Scrolling through Snapchat may be an everyday occurrence for some Blair students, but seeing blatant racism is not. When students logged onto Snapchat in late April, they were surprised and horrified to see two Walt Whitman students in blackface using racist slurs. This incident caused widespread upset and highlights the fact that some people still don’t understand the implications of this kind of behavior. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">The students posted photos of themselves on Snapchat with the subheading of a&nbsp;vulgar and oppressive word while in blackface. “We are ni**ers,” proclaimed the students in their imitation of black people. People who aren't black often argue, “it’s just a word,” or “if black people can say it, why can’t I?” These arguments represent a catastrophic failure to understand the history and implications of this term. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Historically, the N-word has been used by white people to label black people as less-than-human for hundreds of years. In recent years, black people have taken the word for their own in an act of collective empowerment. When non-black people use this term, they connect themselves back to the oppression and violence black people endure. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The use of blackface is a longstanding mockery of black people. It was used in a way to hyperbolize black stereotypes and make comic of being black. Historically performed </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">stereotypes </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">are of black people acting in criminal, sexually predatory or completely foolish ways. By partaking in this behavior, people are reinforcing the ugliest and most violent stereotypes. Even worse, people participating in this blatantly racist act make black people feel unsafe. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As residents of a very diverse county, many Blazers have something to say about the incident. “[Walt Whitman High School] lives up to its name, White-man,” sophomore Jeremy Masson says. Like most Blazers, Masson finds the incident disturbing and unbelievable, “I felt offended by it and confused as to how people in today's society, in a county that's so diverse, act like that and make insensitive jokes like that,” comments Masson. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While Masson criticizes Walt Whitman's culture, junior Merry Hailegiorgis has a different perspective. “When you're living in an all white area and go to a school with mostly white people, it's very rare that you're going to interact with people of different races,” she says. Hailegiorgis believes that two people's&nbsp;actions should not taint the entire school's reputation. She views the incident as a result of ignorance, “Acts like this are ignorant. Ignorance is not a bad word, it just means you don't know that what you're doing will be perceived in a certain way,” she comments. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As for freshman Natalya Burnett, she believes that acts like these reflect the inhumanity of some people. “Racist incidents like these show how awful some people can be,” she says. Burnett cannot fathom why someone would do this, let alone think it was funny, “I can’t understand how someone would believe saying that is okay and make a joke out of it,” she adds. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It’s shocking to see acts like these in such a diverse community. Behavior like this begs the question of whether or not Montgomery County schools can do more to adequately address the problem of racism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31916
31695	August Wilson, American playwright	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">August Wilson was an American poet and playwright who was an integral part of the Black Arts Movement of the 60s and 70s. Born Frederick August Kittel, Wilson was raised in the Hill District of Pittsburgh which would go on to be the setting of most of his plays. Wilson faced the harsh reality of being black in America early, as his family faced racial threats in his neighborhood. Wilson's mother was black and his father was white, so he was ostracized from both the predominantly black Hill District and the predominantly white Hazelwood suburb. At 15 he quit school after being accused of plagiarism. He self-educated himself from then on.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the late 60s he changed his last name to Wilson. In 1968, he confounded the Black Horizons Theater in Pittsburgh. His pieces focused mainly on the experience of black Americans in all fields from taxi drivers to spiritual healers. Much of his work is inspired by jazz and blues music as many of his plays contain a rhythmic cadence. He won two pulitzers for two of his plays, </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fences</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, which was adapted into a major motion picture in 2016 and </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Piano Lesson</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> which was adapted into a TV show in 1995. The influence of Wilson's art have earned a place as one of the most influential African-Americans of the 70s and 80s.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="531"></div><p><br></p>	31694
32737	Football's epic all-star game is not that great	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Over the two weeks between the conference championships and the Super Bowl, the National Football League (NFL) hosts the Pro Bowl extravaganza. It's just for fun, just like an all-star game in any other sport. The players who performed the best each season are whisked away to a beautiful destination, like Hawaii or Orlando. There, they get to make friends, practice, compete in some recreational activities and finally play a (semi) competitive game. It sounds lovely. It probably is quite lovely for the players. The problem with the Pro Bowl, however, is that it is absolutely awful for the fans.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Pro Bowl is supposed to feature the "best of the best" from around the league. It doesn't. Players are voted in by the fans, coaches, and players. And every single year, someone on Twitter always starts complaining that a player got snubbed. The thing is that they are often right. For example, there was outrage this year after Green Bay running back Aaron Jones was not selected for the National Football Conference (NFC)'s team, despite tying for the most touchdowns scored by a running back this season. Players are selected for the game based on opposing coaches' and players' perceptions of who are the toughest and strongest players, not necessarily who had the best season statistically. And the fans of course will vote for players on their favorite team.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32736"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another problem with the Pro Bowl is that there is no competition: players do not give it their all. When watching the game (which no one that I know did), it's very noticable. This is because the game doesn't matter, so players don't want to get hurt playing for no reason.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since the game doesn't matter, many football fans choose not to watch the game. The NFL has noticed that so many people just disregard the event. They have taken a couple of steps to address that, including bringing back the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/S4CNKar0dns?t=24" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">skills showdown.</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> The skills showdown is great if you love watching people play dodgeball or throw footballs at colorful targets.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The skills showdown doesn't really have much to do with football at all. It only serves as a way for ESPN to sell more ads and for the NFL to expand their Pro Bowl marketing campaign. The entire week leading up to the Pro Bowl, social media was flooded by the NFL's account posting pictures and videos from the skills showdown and team practice to stir up some more interest.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">All of these negative aspects beg the question: How can the game be fixed? Perhaps the league could come up with some sort of prize or reward for winning the game, which would motivate players to try harder. Maybe the league could take a similar path that the NHL (National Hockey League) does. The NHL all-star game is a&nbsp;3-on-3 hockey tournament instead of a regular game. It's a fun event that provides a break from the season, and is very fun to watch. If the NFL played a more fast-paced, high-scoring game, fans might be more attracted to the event.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At the end of the day, the NFL needs to change the Pro Bowl soon. Please. For all of our sakes.</span></p>	32736
32787	From Zoom Seders to virtual masses, religious families and organizations are getting creative when it comes to worshipping from home	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For Christians, Easter is a day of joy and celebration. People walk into the church in their brightest finery, bells ringing, white flowers on the altar and white draperies stretching from floor to ceiling at the front of Catholic churches. The pews are more crowded than normal; even those who haven't attended church once in the past year show up for Easter Mass. Across the room, joyous cries of "He has risen!" can just be made out over the clatter of everybody trying to find a seat.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32786"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Passover is a similarly significant holiday for Jewish people, lasting from April 8 to 16 this year. The Seder is celebrated on the evening of the first day, or for some families, the evenings of the first and second days, traditionally with several generations of family. It involves a plate containing all of the foods specified in the Torah, and the retelling of the story of Exodus. Even for those who aren't particularly religious, like junior Emma Rosenberg, Passover is very meaningful. "Every year we go to New York and get to see a whole bunch of my dad's family that we really only see at this time of year," she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Not this year, however. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Md. Gov. Larry Hogan </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/whats-allowed-banned-prohibited-in-dc-maryland-virginia-under-stay-at-home-orders-coronavirus/2259216/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">banned</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> all gatherings of over ten people, including religious services. As a result, all religious institutes have been forced to find new ways to hold services and worship with their members. This is an especially prevalent issue for Christians and Jews since Easter was on Sunday and the week of Passover ended on Thursday.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some churches, like St. Camillus Catholic Church and the Church of Atonement, both located in Silver Spring, are holding online masses, live streamed on YouTube. They celebrate the mass the same way as usual, with the exception of the Celebration of the Eucharist, which is typically an important part of the mass. Instead, the Act of Spiritual Communion is read for those attending the mass virtually. Petkoff, who attends the Church of Atonement, finds that the live stream aspect of the service makes it more realistic. "I still feel like I'm worshipping with other people, which is really great," she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Her church is also finding ways to replace youth group meetings in an effort to stay connected, which has led to the group getting to spend more time with each other than they regularly would. "Our youth group also does Zoom calls every Wednesday and Sunday and it's a mix of Bible study and games," she says, "usually our youth group only regularly hangs out on Sunday evenings so I'm actually seeing my church friends more."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused an increased need for volunteers that her church is helping to fill. "Last weekend me and a few other people went over to an older couple's house to clean their home because they physically can't," she says. "Not many people are willing to go help them anymore."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Jewish people have been forced to find ways to carry out their traditions from quarantine, as well. "We, for the past few years, have been meeting at different nice restaurants and doing shortened Seders and then just having really nice long meals together," Rosenberg says. There, they take part in some of her nana's best traditions, like singing to the Passover song Daiyenu with kazoos. "Obviously, we couldn't do all that this year but my uncle put together a Seder over Zoom that was actually really great," she adds.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rosenberg, like Petkoff, finds herself getting to see family and friends more frequently than she regularly would. "We've been doing Zoom calls with that whole part of my family a lot more often so in a way I'm seeing them more than usual," she says. There are some benefits to the sudden increase in time spent at home.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, there are also drawbacks. Petkoff, for one, misses the traditions and children at her church. "I was really bummed during Palm Sunday because we'd usually get palm leaves, and it's always really cute watching the kids play with them," she says. "Also dressing up for Easter and watching the kids look for eggs around the church."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rosenberg misses being able to see her family in person, but finds it admirable how so many people everywhere are trying to stay together, even in a time like this, which made her Passover enjoyable considering everything that's going on. "I care a lot about spending physical time with people so this whole experience has been very trying but I love that so many people are trying to make an effort to be connected in the best ways they can," she says.</span></p>	32786
32935	The must watch coming-of-age movie is now out on Netflix	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Starring Auli'i Cravalho, known for her role as the titular character in "Moana," "All Together Now," (released Aug. 28th, 2020) targets multiple realistic issues that teenagers could face every day. Covering financial troubles, tragedy and even homelessness, this movie seems like an ideal watch with family and friends. However, the question remains: does the film portray these topics appropriately?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Directed by Brett Haley, who also directed the Netflix original "All the Bright Places," the movie follows the story of Amber Appleton (Auli'i Cravalho), a lively teenager who works multiple jobs with her eyes set on attending Carnegie Mellon University. She and her mom, Becky (Justina Machado), face numerous obstacles because they are homeless because they live in a school bus, which they have access to due to Becky's job as a bus driver.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">More troubling issues arise as Becky chooses to get back together with her abusive boyfriend, straining the relationship between the mother and daughter. As the tension in their relationship increases, Amber tries to follow her dreams and pursues her singing talent. However, she refuses all help from her friends and family in an attempt to be completely independent.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The movie succeeds at conveying concepts such as homelessness and financial struggles in a realistic and non-offensive manner, increasing public awareness to how many teenagers and adults alike are affected by financial problems. "All Together Now" clearly depicts Amber’s living conditions on the bus, including how all her possessions fit in one backpack and how there is a compartment on the bus that hides their pillows and blankets. Although this is only one way people can adapt to being homeless, the movie does an excellent job of presenting Amber's routine and the reasoning behind it.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32934"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This movie also does a wonderful job of portraying the inner conflict and independence struggles of a teenager through the plot. Over the course of&nbsp;the movie, Amber struggles to make decisions about receiving help from her friends, and ends up rejecting their help every time she needs it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In some parts of the movie, Amber's independence is shown as an advantage </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">— </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">with her talent alone, she is able to land an audition for Carnegie Mellon's drama school. On the other hand, it is also shown that when she refuses all help, Amber collapses under the pressure of her financial status, personal issues and education, spiraling into multiple problems she cannot control.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The movie, however, did have some significant downsides. For instance, Oliver, Becky's abusive boyfriend, never appears in the movie. He is only mentioned, and as a result, the audience sees no interaction between Oliver and Becky or Oliver and Amber. It would have been interesting to see him make an appearance as he plays an important part in both Amber's and Becky's lives.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another drawback is the underplayed romance between Amber and her classmate, Ty (Rhenzy Feliz). Ty proves to be a kind and considerate friend, and he offers Amber a place to stay when she's completely desperate. However, nothing results from the clear feelings between the two by the end of the movie, which serves as a disappointment to an anticipated couple.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, these downsides do not take away from the well thought-out movie that "All Together Now" is. The movie brings awareness to many issues and reveals a clear theme: it's more than alright to rely on others for support. "All Together Now" is a great watch with family and friends because it pulls together multiple issues that some people may face daily with an eye-opening plotline.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"All Together Now" is rated PG for thematic content, some language, and brief suggestive comments, and is now available to watch on Netflix.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32934
32914	Liverpool F.C. went from a mediocre team to champions in five years, largely due to Klopp	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On June 25, Liverpool won the English Premier League (EPL) for the first time in thirty years. The Reds clinched the title with seven games remaining on their schedule, the earliest any team has been crowned champions.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A roster featuring Virgil Van Dijk, Sadio Mané and Jordan Henderson played a big part in this accomplishment, but one man is mostly responsible for the success Liverpool has experienced. That man is manager Jürgen Klopp, the 53-year-old German who was appointed as Liverpool’s manager on Oct. 8, 2015.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The next day, dozens of reporters packed into a small room at Anfield to witness Klopp’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV_cRk9YPpA" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">first press conference</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> as Liverpool’s boss. An excited, optimistic and humbled Klopp said he wanted to turn Liverpool fans from “doubters into believers,” and correctly predicted he would </span><a href="https://www.sportbible.com/football/news-take-a-bow-klopp-predicted-liverpool-would-win-the-league-in-2020-in-2016-20200625" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">win a title</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in four seasons.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32913"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Taking over Liverpool was no easy task. The club had lost their talented forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City that offseason and failed to find a solid replacement. The team was inconsistent under former manager Brendan Rodgers, who was fired on Oct. 4, 2015. Mediocrity was becoming normal and fear grew about the status of the club moving forward, as it had not won any major trophies since 2005. If there was anyone that was right for the job, it was Klopp.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Klopp had a track record of improving losing clubs. During his first job at FSV Mainz 05, Klopp saved a team from relegation to the third tier and brought them to the Bundesliga for the first time ever. During his second job at Borussia Dortmund, Klopp developed a struggling team into a German powerhouse during his 7-year tenure. Under Klopp, Dortmund won the league and other domestic German trophies multiple times, as well as reaching the UCL final.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Klopp’s track record at his previous teams and a struggling giant such as Liverpool is what made them a perfect fit. Klopp implemented his signature “gegenpressing” tactic, when the team that loses possession immediately attempts to take it back instead of dropping back to play defense. This strategy benefitted the team immediately.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During his first season with Liverpool in 2015, Klopp dealt with an inconsistent team in the EPL, finishing eighth. In Europe, he took Liverpool to the Europa League final, losing to Sevilla. A key turning point that season came during the Europa League semi-final when Liverpool played Dortmund. Liverpool completed a major comeback when Dejan Lovren </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJV5xkj_3SA" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">scored a goal</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> which advanced the Reds to the final, sending the Anfield crowd into a frenzy. Despite losing the final, this match proved that it was only the beginning of what was to come, and optimism sank in with the fanbase.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From his first offseason with Liverpool, Klopp has implemented his style with his signings. Players such as Mohammed Salah, Virgil Van Dijk and Sadio Mané are testaments of Klopp’s ability to find and develop world class talent. Each of those players have been nominated for awards or won them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A heartbreaking loss to Real Madrid in the 2018 UCL final did not stop Liverpool. For the 2018-19 season, Klopp fixed Liverpool’s goalkeeper woes, acquiring Brazilian Alisson Becker from Roma. Chemistry continued growing, so a title run for Liverpool and possibly a UCL title was likely. The Reds were fantastic in both the EPL and UCL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Liverpool and Manchester City competed for the league title the entire year, with City eventually winning the league just one point above Liverpool. In the UCL however, it was Liverpool’s year. After what is considered one of soccer’s </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48179167" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">best comebacks of all time</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> against FC Barcelona, Liverpool beat Tottenham 2-0 in the Champions League final to win the club’s sixth UCL title. Klopp had transformed Liverpool back into a European powerhouse, but there was one thing left to do.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Klopp led Liverpool to an elusive Premier League title this season, something fans waited thirty years for. It was not long until it became clear the stars were aligning for Liverpool. Every player contributed, and the results showed as Liverpool stayed on top by a large margin the entire year, as much as 23 points at one point.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Klopp has transformed Liverpool from mediocre back into a powerhouse. World class talent is arriving instead of departing. He has transformed Anfield into a fortress, as the team has not lost a home Premier League game in three years. The German has become a living legend among fans, and he is set to </span><a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/377870-liverpool-fc-statement-jurgen-klopp-extends-contract-to-2024#:~:text=Liverpool%20Football%20Club%20are%20delighted,and%2Da%2Dhalf%20years." target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">remain manager until at least 2024</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. He has won four trophies during his first five years on Merseyside, and Klopp will hopefully lead the Reds to many more.</span></p>	32913
33119	Applying to college during a pandemic	<p>Cancelled SATs. Pass/incomplete grades. Disrupted extracurriculars. Changes in financial aid status. Interviews moving online.</p><p>This year’s college admissions have been thrown into uncharted territory because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both students and colleges are navigating a new process, marked by a lack of in-person resources. From testing to financial aid, this year is different, and some students are unsure of how to handle it.</p><h3><strong>Standardized testing</strong></h3><p>Standardized tests like the SAT and ACT normally take place in school buildings, with many students testing in each room. As a result of building closures and social distancing rules, these tests have been cancelled since March.</p><p>For students, that means uncertainty. Some have already taken their tests, but others have had theirs cancelled, rescheduled, and cancelled again. They are unsure whether they’ll be able to take them this fall.</p><p>“It's definitely increased my stress levels a little bit,” junior Raquel Sklar says. She intended to take Blair’s free SAT in March but is instead now looking to the August date.</p><p>Currently, the College Board plans to offer SAT test dates in August, September, and October. The ACT organization is offering its test in July, September, and October. All of this, however, depends on whether social distancing regulations relax enough that tests are able to take place.</p><p>This uncertainty has spurred many colleges to go “test-optional,” meaning students may submit SAT or ACT scores but will not be penalized if they choose not to. While some schools plan to offer test-optional admission only to the high school graduating class of 2021, others plan to continue with test-optional policies for years to come.</p><p>The University of California (UC) system has gone so far as to announce plans to permanently phase out the ACT and SAT tests. Smaller schools like the College of William &amp; Mary, a public research university in Virginia, are also beginning similar plans.</p><p>“We had been working on a plan to go test optional in the next coming years… and [because of covid-19], we had decided to move that program forward,” JonDavid Nichols, an Assistant Dean of Admissions at William &amp; Mary, says. “Partially because of [COVID-19] and the lack of opportunities for students to be taking the SAT… and because of the movement that just is… viewing standardized tests as not as necessarily important in the college admissions process, this was definitely the right time for us to implement this program.”</p><p>Test-optional policies are a relief for some, like junior Reid Duran. She expressed gratitude that the UC system, for one, is going test-optional. “A lot of schools, like California schools, just announced [that] they don't [require] our class to submit our SATs, which is good, because I'm looking at a lot of California schools,” she says.</p><p>But not all schools have gone test-optional yet. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), for instance, still requires a SAT or ACT score, although it removed the SAT subject test requirement shortly before the spread of the coronavirus in the US. “We really are waiting things out to see what's happening with different schools and different people's ability to take tests before coming to any final decision about what to do next,” Kellen Manning, Assistant Director of Communication at MIT, says.&nbsp;</p><p>Certainly, plenty is up in the air. Besides the cancellation of spring tests and the uncertainty about fall test dates, some tests may be moved online. The College Board, which this spring offered online Advanced Placement tests, floated the idea for online administrations of the SAT, but they ultimately dropped it because of barriers to equitably providing the test to students with different levels of access to technology. The ACT still intends to proceed with a remote-proctoring test.</p><p>With all of these changes to standardized testing, however, many schools say that they will maintain their holistic approach to admissions this year, in which they look at each student as a whole. “We've always operated as [if] the tests are just part of your [application]. We look at everything,” Manning says. “Our goal as an admissions office hasn't changed.”</p><h3><strong>Grades</strong></h3><p>With standardized testing in turmoil, grades are poised to play a bigger role in the process. “[Without test scores], college counselors are just going to have to take a deeper look,” Blair counselor Belvey Russ says—meaning at grades as well as recommendations and essays.</p><p>But grades, too, have been disrupted. School districts throughout the country are implementing their own grading systems as a result of COVID-19-related closures. Some are transitioning to a pass/fail or pass/incomplete system; some are modifying letter grade systems; and some, like Montgomery County, have <a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/students-can-choose-a-letter-grade-one-higher-than-their-third-quarter-mark-or-a-pass-for-their-transcript-mcps-announces-33074/" target="_blank">developed a blend of the two</a>.</p><p>Colleges generally look at students’ grades in the context of their school or county, and this year is similar. “Students apply from many different grading systems, and we always consider applications based on each high school’s specific grading system,” Bailey Jackelen, an Assistant Director of Undergraduate Admissions at Johns Hopkins University, said by email.&nbsp;</p><p>This year’s disruptions to schools are happening universally, and universities know that, according to Jessica Johnston, an Associate Director of Admission at Scripps College in California. “​We understand that high school transcripts are going to look very different than we're used to this year,” she wrote in an email. “We'll be looking at those recommendation letters and the strength of the program to get a sense of academic performance.”</p><p>Nichols at William &amp; Mary agrees. “We will be accepting pass/fail grades completely,” he says. “This is a unique situation for everyone.”</p><h3><strong>Disrupted extracurriculars and summer plans</strong></h3><p>Grades, test scores, essays, recommendations, and extracurriculars—these make up the bulk of a college application. Essays are much the same as they were, though both the Common Application and the Coalition Application are adding an optional question about the effects of the pandemic on students’ lives. Likewise, the recommendations process has not changed much, with the important caveat that students lost a few months to connect with their teachers.</p><p>Extracurriculars, on the other hand, have been upended. Junior Sophia Kim, for instance, was planning to travel to Panama this summer with a nonprofit. “I've been preparing for that since November,” she says. “I was going to live with a family in a town in Panama for four weeks and during the day I would run a kind of a day camp for kids, and at the same time I would be helping them complete a community project.”</p><p>Kim’s opportunity was cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, as were the activities of students across the country. Athletics and other competitions have been suspended. Some internships have gone virtual, though many cannot. All of this serves to introduce yet another change to students’ applications.</p><p>Ray Anderson, a college counselor with AGM-College Counseling, says, “What we're planning is very much uncertain.” Ordinarily, his clients engage in a variety of extracurriculars, which he often encourages them to write about in college application essays. For instance, one of his clients planned to go to Philmont, a Boy Scout camp in New Mexico, this summer to lead two-week hiking expeditions. Because of the coronavirus, that trip may not be possible.</p><p>It is not just summer plans that have changed. The opportunity to do most spring extracurriculars was lost. For Kim, the soccer season was cancelled—and with it, a key chance to be scouted by college coaches.</p><p>“I do want to play soccer in college, and this spring was the most important time for me to be able to show coaches what I can do at different showcases and as well as just regular games,” she says. She is sending coaches videos of her playing, but that does not make up for lost showcases and summer soccer camps.</p><p>Some have replaced their original plans with makeshift virtual ones. Sklar, for instance, is taking an interior design course at Montgomery College this summer in place of a camp counseling job. “[The job] definitely would have been helpful for my application, but I've done a lot of other volunteer opportunities,” she says. And, of course, colleges understand that opportunities this year have been cut short.</p><p>“We're not going to hold it against you that you weren't able to participate in something that wasn't available to you or that you didn't feel comfortable participating in because of the climate,” Manning from MIT explains.</p><h3><strong>Visiting schools</strong></h3><p>The coronavirus pandemic is also reinventing how students go about looking at and interacting with colleges. “Kids, typically beginning in the spring, are doing college visits [and] in-person interviews,” Randy McKnight, a college advisor who works at AGM-College Counseling along with Anderson, says. “A lot of those opportunities have been lost.”</p><p>Traditionally, campus visits have been an important way for students to get the feel of a school. They help students decide which schools to apply to, and then later which schools to attend. Visits also demonstrate students’ interest in a school, which some schools factor into their admissions decisions.</p><p>Those tours are just not possible at the moment. Instead, schools are creating virtual versions with enthusiastic voices and bright campus videos.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33118"></div><p>“Hello, and welcome to the University of Maryland,” says a voice in UMD’s cheerful YouVisit tour. “Welcome to Cambridge, Massachusetts,” a miniature person pipes up, superimposed over a picture of Harvard University on the college’s virtual tour, which is also hosted on YouVisit. “We’re starting right here in Marston Quad, the beautiful green space at the heart of campus,” a senior at Pomona College says in a YouTube video.</p><p>Universities are using a variety of platforms to connect with potential applicants at a time of social distancing. Some are scheduling online information sessions and making current college students available to answer questions.</p><p>For high school students, this situation is not ideal. “I much prefer going to the actual college campus,” says junior Coltin Chao. “[The virtual tours are] not bad. They're definitely trying, and I can appreciate that, but… I'd rather actually see what the campus looks like itself and what the environment is rather than them telling me.”</p><p>College advisors agree with that assessment. “If you're doing a virtual tour, you're really looking at what they want you to see,” McKnight says. Through a screen, students miss out on the opportunity to wander around and look at the campus as a whole.</p><p>Moreover, some colleges used to do on-campus interviews over the summer. While interviews often come later, the summer conversations gave students an early chance to show their interest. This year, interviews are going virtual, as is the case at both Scripps College and William &amp; Mary, according to Johnston and Nichols respectively. Anderson, one of the college advisors from AGM-College Counseling, has already prepped a client on how to impress colleges during a FaceTime interview.</p><p>Interviewing online is naturally different than in person—one more way in which differing access to technology may affect the application process. Nichols sees advantages to it, though. “It allows us to have more interviews than ever and be able to offer them to different groups of people than ever before,” he says. Even if campuses open back up, William &amp; Mary may still continue to offer these virtual interviews.</p><h3><strong>Financial and enrollment changes</strong></h3><p>The economic damage from COVID-19, too, is impacting colleges and students alike. With millions having lost their jobs or been furloughed, financial aid is increasing in importance for students, putting strain on universities.</p><p>Colleges are preparing for greater financial need this year. “We've definitely seen an uptick in requests for additional aid, with people specifically referencing [COVID-19] job losses or furloughs,” Joe Dobrota, Director of Financial Aid at William &amp; Mary, says.</p><p>“More than anything else, I expect to see a greater volume of applications [for aid] and requests for increased funding,” Patrick Register, Director of Financial Aid and Scholarships at UC Santa Cruz, agreed in an email.</p><p>Russ, the Blair counselor, likewise believes that demand for financial aid will increase. Her advice to students is to communicate with parents to determine how much aid is needed: “Speak with your parents, and just have a realistic conversation of what can you afford, what happens if a parent loses their job and they're not able to pay tuition,” she says.</p><p>At William &amp; Mary, Dobrota is seeing some of the financial effects of the coronavirus. “We've definitely heard from some folks who [say], given everything that's happening, ‘We're not able to come right now,’” he says.</p><p>Russ expects to see more students staying in-state or attending community college. Students will “maybe spend… a year at [Montgomery College] taking those core classes and then transferring,” she says.</p><p>Indeed, Montgomery College is seeing record enrollment, with an 11% increase in summer enrollment since last year. “Historically, community colleges have seen a rise in enrollment when the economy is down,” says Marcus Rosano, Director of Media and Public Relations at the school. “It's a good thing to see our students understanding that Montgomery College is… an affordable option, but you can get a pretty awesome education [there].”</p><p>Similarly, the option to pursue a gap year is attracting new interest. McKnight and Anderson from AGM-College Counseling have both seen some new interest in gap years among their clients, and one of their seniors has already elected to take the opportunity. They recommend having a plan for the gap year, though, and caution that there will be fewer opportunities for gap year activities this year because of high demand.</p><p>Universities, too, are dealing with new financial stress. “Having a higher number of needy students is going to just proportionally increase that demand for the aid budget,” says Dobrota.</p><p>Moreover, the closures from this semester are costing colleges. “With a greatly reduced number of students physically on campus… there is no revenue to sustain the expenses associated with many of the units in Student Life,” wrote Register. “[COVID-19] will place a financial strain on the institution.”</p><p>It is important to note that financial strain varies by institution. While the current situation does come as a universal blow, many colleges have endowments to help them through—such as Harvard University, which as of 2019 had an endowment over 40 billion dollars, per their most recent financial report.</p><p>Smaller institutions, however, are facing steeper challenges. For instance, in California, the San Francisco Art Institute recently announced it was no longer admitting new students. The school had struggled financially for years, and its discussions about merging with another school broke down because of COVID-19. Similarly, MacMurray College in Illinois is closing. The pandemic, while not cited as the ultimate cause, was a complicating factor in the school’s economic situation.</p><p>Schools like these two fit the profile of those most likely to be hard hit: small private institutions with low endowments or high tuition discount rates. The economic downturn does not discriminate, and colleges’ financial situations have been thrown in limbo nationwide. However, some are better equipped to weather the storm than others.</p><h3><strong>What should students focus on?</strong></h3><p>Much is changing, but the best course of action may be to work on what hasn’t. “I would back up and start [in] a slightly different place,” McKnight, one of the college advisors, says. “Talking to kids, we try to stay focused on what we think hasn't changed.”</p><p>What exactly does that mean? Do well in school and learn more about yourself, McKnight says. Finish your Trailblazer packet and start your application essays, Russ says. Share your story and your passion, Nichols says.</p><p>It is still early in the application cycle, and colleges are not yet sure how all of the changes that COVID-19 has wrought will be dealt with. But people ranging from school counselors to college advisors to admissions officials all agree that students should try to focus on what they can control, not on the turmoil in the world.</p><p>“Take a deep breath,” Russ says. “Do what you can from your point of view… but we can't help what's going on in the world. So just do your part, and it'll be what it is.”</p>	33118
32918	Caps' former head coach leads New York to second round of playoffs after only five games, prompting Caps to fire Coach Todd Reirden	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Aug. 20, the Washington Capitals were eliminated by the New York Islanders, losing the series 4-1. Three days later, the Caps fired Coach Todd Reirden.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Islanders outmatched the Capitals in every aspect during this series. New York played like an energized team that was hungry to win. They looked prepared and organized. Washington, on the other hand, did not. Coach Todd Reirden’s team looked tired and disinterested much of the series. Throughout this series, Reirden had trouble inspiring his team and his game planning was nowhere near good enough. Sure, Islanders' Coach Barry Trotz is one of the best in the league, but the Caps’ roster appears far better on paper than New York’s. Something wasn't clicking for Washington: only three players from a championship caliber roster scored and the team was dominated in its own zone. Their lack of focus was highlighted by a pattern of careless penalties.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During a postgame interview, Washington's veteran Nicklas Backstrom admitted that they did not play hard enough and lacked the desire to win. “They wanted it more than we did,” </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/08/20/capitals-went-out-with-barely-whimper-their-stanley-cup-feels-further-away-than-ever/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Backstrom said.&nbsp;</a></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is not a coincidence that Todd Reirden’s side was massively outplayed by an Islanders team coached by Barry Trotz. Trotz led Washington to a Stanley Cup victory in 2018, but later walked away from his contract with the Capitals, unsatisfied with the money offered. Washington then promoted Assistant Coach Todd Reirden to be Head Coach. Reirden had been groomed as Trotz’s successor for a while, and the organization believed he was going to be hockey’s next great coach. This series proved that the Caps should have fought harder to keep Trotz and that it may be time for major changes within the organization, with Reirden already out as head coach.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Upon his arrival to New York in 2018, Trotz immediately turned the Islanders from a last place team into a potential Stanley Cup contender. While Washington has remained a contender, it has failed to advance past the first round of the playoffs without him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is unacceptable for a championship caliber team like the Capitals to lose in the first round of the playoffs in back to back years. Star veterans like Alex Ovechkin, Nickolas Backstrom and TJ Oshie are only getting older, so the championship window is quickly closing. A contender like the Capitals should not be placed into the hands of an inexperienced coach like Reirden. Although Reirden has good coaching potential, a championship contender needs a veteran coach such as Peter Laviolette or Gerard Gallant, so it was wise for him to be let go.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32917"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Between replacing Reirden, overhauling the defense and acquiring younger, faster players to keep up with the rest of the league, General Manager Brian MacLellan has his work cut out for him this offseason. Not only that, but Alex Ovechkin needs a contract extension. He is entering the final year of his contract. Keeping him in Washington for the rest of his career should not be difficult, but it is important to pay him what he deserves.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This loss prompted uncertainty over the team’s championship window. The window is still open, but the decisions of the front office could determine how much longer that is true. The Caps need a retool of the defense and coaching staff. Brian MacLellan is an above average General Manager, so there is reason to believe Washington will continue to be competitive.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Capitals' 2020 playoff performance was embarrassing and unacceptable. This is the same team that won a Stanley Cup in 2018. Alex Ovechkin is one of the greatest players of all time and deserves more than one championship. Braden Holtby will likely leave via free agency this offseason, and it will be disappointing to see his tenure end this way. The front office owes it to the core group of players and the fanbase to make the necessary changes to win another championship.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32917
32735	The Blazers lose to the Vikings by a score of 50-45	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (13-8) lost to the Whitman Vikings (12-9) in a close game on Friday night. The two teams kept the game close, but the Vikings ultimately pulled through in the fourth quarter.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers started the night off ahead, using some trickery and good footwork to fool the Whitman defense. The Vikings however tied the score near the end of the quarter with swift passing. The first quarter ended with a score of 9-7 in favor of Whitman following a buzzer beater from the Vikings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers pulled ahead again in the second quarter, getting into a rhythm as senior guard Kate Hildebrant scored five consecutive points. The Vikings, in an attempt to catch up, repeatedly stole the ball and hastily took three pointers. The Blazers were able to get the defensive rebounds. "We knew they were strong shooters, so we knew we had to get out on them and be sure to close out on the shooters. I think we did a pretty decent job of getting and covering each other," senior captain Lucy Martin says. Blair subsequently began to go on a 7-0 run to close the half ahead, 25-19.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32734"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Starting the second half, Whitman began to miss three pointers and the Blazers stepped up their defense in the post. However, Whitman began to catch up as the Blazers struggled to make baskets from the free throw line and committed bad fouls. Tensions rose as the last quarter began at 40-40. Senior center Adia Keene scored three points for Blair, but a three pointer from Whitman tied the score 43-43 with less than two minutes left.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The teams struggled for possession of the ball, but Whitman ultimately scored another layup and a free throw with 38 seconds left in the game. After a time out, senior captain Lucy Martin was unable to execute a set play, failing to throw the ball far enough across the court to tie the score. "It's something we've been practicing during practice, but unfortunately I didn't throw [the ball] far enough. The other team got the ball, which is a really bad turnover at the end of the game. We actually managed to get it back, and get 2 points with 20 seconds, so that was really good," Martin says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Freshman guard Natalie Frost managed to make the layup with 22 seconds, but more fouls from the Blazers allowed Whitman two more points from free throws and five more points overall. The game ended at 50-45.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Regardless of the loss, the Blazers felt proud of their playing as a whole and are looking forward to tackling their next opponents at playoffs. "This game we really pulled together and worked as a team. I think we're all excited for playoffs. We can definitely improve our communication on the court, and we need to just keep pushing till the end and not give up dumb points on the court," Hildebrant says.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, February 28th against the Springbrook Blue Devils at 7:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32734
32034	The Blazers started off strong with a 2-1 win in a hard-fought match	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair Blazers (3-1) beat the Northwest Jaguars (1-2) 2-1 in their first official home game of the season on Monday, Sept. 9. It was a close game with several fouls and strong offensive runs on both sides, but the Blazers' continuous offensive pressure helped them take the victory.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers started off strong, scoring off of senior captain Janie Pitner's corner kick in the second minute. However, Northwest quickly responded with a goal only two minutes later. The Blazers had several more offensive opportunities, including many combinations between senior captain Noa Dorah and sophomore Marlee Ginyard, but couldn’t find the back of the net until Ginyard got around a Northwest defender and tapped the ball in for another goal halfway through the first half. The rest of the half remained scoreless.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32025"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair kept putting on the pressure in the second half. Dorah had more close shots, and junior Sophia Kim also created scoring opportunities for the Blazers. Junior Molly Salpekar aggressively fouled a Northwest forward with less than fifteen minutes left in the game and received a yellow card, but not before stopping the player from scoring. Blair kept the ball on Northwest’s half for most of the final minutes, and the game ended without any more goals.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Head coach Robert Gibb was happy with the outcome of the match, but expected more from his players. "We made a lot of mental errors, particularly on our free kick situations," he said, "They're things we've gone over, so I was a little bit surprised at how we were seemingly clueless on those things."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gibb thought that the team didn't look quite as fluid as they had in preseason. "We didn't click the way that we have in some of our previous scrimmages," he said. Overall, though, he was happy with their performance.This was the first time that the Blazers beat the Jaguars in at least three years. Two years ago, they lost 2-1 in overtime, and last year they lost 2-1 in an intense game. This season, the team was excited to finally earn the 2-1 win for themselves.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers play their next home game against the Gaithersburg Sr. Trojans at 5:30 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 20.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32025
33002	MCPS should allow in-person fall sports practices for the remainder of the first semester	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It has been 203 days since MCPS closed schools in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. A two-week break turned into months, and students and staff adapted to their virtual lifestyles as best they could. In addition to our shared feelings of isolation and longing for a return to pre-pandemic life, many high school students are coping with the added burden of losing their fall sports season. It was predictable that MCPS would keep fall sports virtual, but the reality is that once-a-week Zoom meetings don't feel quite the same as practicing everyday afterschool with teammates.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The balance between the safety of our community and the desire to return to in-person sports is tenuous. Paul MacNairn, a senior captain for Blair's cross country team, acknowledges that MCPS is facing a difficult choice in deciding how to start fall sports since each one carries its own risk. "Cross country is probably one of the sports that are the least risky to do, but at the same time MCPS can't just allow one sport to come back and not the others," he said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33001"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is imperative that our county finds a happy medium regarding fall sports during the first semester, which will end on January 29. MCPS should allow in-person conditioning and skills-based training for all fall sports during the first semester as long as student-athletes are following county guidelines established to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This will help high school athletes to prepare for their competitive seasons during the second semester while minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission, promoting better mental health for students, and leveling the playing field for disadvantaged students.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When it comes to student safety, there is no higher priority for the county. That is why coaches and players would be held accountable for adhering to the guidelines that the county proposes. According to Rita Boulé, Blair's Athletic Director, she will work with coaches and students to establish protocols on how to hold practices that follow social-distancing, mask-wearing, and hygiene </span><a href="https://www.nfhs.org/media/3812287/2020-nfhs-guidance-for-opening-up-high-school-athletics-and-activities-nfhs-smac-may-15_2020-final.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">guidelines</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. "We will make the best, safest decisions we can with whatever latitude we have to make those decisions," Boulé said. If the county allows high schools to have in-person practices for fall sports, Athletic Directors will work together to ensure that those practices reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission as much as possible.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We cannot ignore how COVID-19 disproportionally affects the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) community. During these dual pandemics of racial injustice and the coronavirus, Black and Latinx communities have been hit especially hard. In Maryland, Black Americans make up 30 percent of the population but account for 40 percent of all deaths due to the virus. Latinx Americans only account for 10 percent of the population but 25 percent of all cases. These </span><a href="https://covidtracking.com/race/dashboard#state-md" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">disparities</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> are the product of deeply-entrenched systemic injustices that deny adequate healthcare and resources to BIPOC individuals; and these disparities urge us to take every precaution so that our in-person practices are safe for the athletes and their coaches.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">High school athletes will benefit from doing any activities that they can do while socially distanced from their teammates. It's a no-brainer that being outdoors while doing a sport you love with people you enjoy is an important part to our mental and physical health. </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/308420/americans-say-covid-hurting-mental-health.aspx" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Young Americans </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">are struggling with their mental health during this period of isolation more than the older generations. Instead of staring at black squares on Zoom, students can spend time with one another while socially distanced and wearing a mask when appropriate. In-person practices will do more good for our students' mental and physical health than any number of Mindfulness Minutes will.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In terms of equity, transportation to and from practices poses questions as to whether students who rely on public buses face a significantly higher risk of contracting COVID-19. In </span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/there-is-little-evidence-that-mass-transit-poses-a-risk-of-coronavirus-outbreaks/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">studies</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> conducted by researchers in Paris and Tokyo, only about one percent of major coronavirus outbreaks occurred on public transportation. An alternative solution would be to use the fleets of MCPS school buses to shuttle students to and from practices. There must be flexibility on the part of our school system to use their resources, such as school buses, to solve challenges that arise during these unprecedented times.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Keeping sports virtual for the fall will also worsen wealth disparities among students. Athletes that can afford to participate in club sports will have yet another leg up over their economically-disadvantaged teammates. Athletic scholarships are vital to student athletes who would not be able to otherwise afford higher education, and the skills needed to earn these scholarships are built under the watchful eye of coaches, not on Zoom calls. Having free in-person training for higher school athletes will help to level the playing field.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The issue of bringing back high school sports is not an either/or scenario. We can have our cake and eat it, too. High school athletes can benefit from training with their teammates and escaping the isolation of their online lifestyles, and we can hold them to rigid guidelines for social-distancing, mask-wearing, and hygiene. Even if the football team can't tackle one another yet, they can still do drills to prepare them for their spring seasons.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even though we have to play it safe, we can still play.</span></p>	33001
31988	Montgomery County Alcohol Beverage Services obscures its true identity by donating to charity	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery County Alcohol Beverage Services (ABS) misleads the people of Montgomery County by masquerading as a benevolent organization.

And it might as well be. Junior Valentina Simon was only a middle schooler when her father was battling stage three colorectal cancer. Looking back from now where her father is a cancer survivor, Simon says her family would have gladly accepted donations from ABS, having spent nearly $20,000 on her father's treatment. "I believe if people want to go out and enjoy themselves, and there is a tax on that enjoyment that goes towards a good cause, I believe that's reasonable," Simon says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, there are many facets to ABS' initiative.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This very alcohol that ABS spreads throughout Montgomery County is the root of both health and societal issues.

According to the American Cancer Society, alcohol is</span><a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/diet-physical-activity/alcohol-use-and-cancer.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </a><a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/diet-physical-activity/alcohol-use-and-cancer.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">linked to cancer</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in nine different organs of the body. But it doesn't stop there.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Alcohol breaks families and clouds one's judgement.

Finance also becomes an issue, as people can</span><a href="https://www.addictioncenter.com/alcohol/impact-alcoholism-families/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </a><a href="https://www.addictioncenter.com/alcohol/impact-alcoholism-families/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">spend from $20 to $300</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> drinking alcohol per sitting. ABS is the organization that sells a substance which&nbsp;destroys our most important values: health and family.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Upon closer inspection, there is an even more troubling aspect to ABS. Montgomery County Alcohol Beverage Services was not always known as "ABS." Previously known as the Montgomery County Department of Liquor Control, the department, according to the Washington Post,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/a-makeover-for-montgomerys-department-of-liquor-control/2018/08/05/92037cca-9657-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/a-makeover-for-montgomerys-department-of-liquor-control/2018/08/05/92037cca-9657-11e8-810c-5fa705927d54_story.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">changed its name</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> this year to reflect its new nature of being "less controlling" in an "effort to move the department’s image away from its regulatory focus and toward customer service."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is especially worrying as, according to the Center for Disease Prevention and Control, alcohol is the most commonly abused drug among adolescents in the U.S. In an era where teenagers are drinking more than ever, "less control" on alcohol has no place in keeping the next generation safe and healthy.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31987"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is what Bob Dorfman, director of ABS, has to say about this issue "Supporting programs that benefit families and children falls in line with our commitment to public health and safety," he said. To sum this up in one word: Hypocrisy.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The worst part is that the funds ABS raises funds for charity is nothing more than a shallow marketing strategy. According to</span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3029037/americans-want-to-give-back-with-their-purchases-not-with-charity" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </a><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3029037/americans-want-to-give-back-with-their-purchases-not-with-charity" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Fast Company</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, more people buy from socially-minded businesses, that is, companies that donate a portion of their revenue to charitable institutions, because the public sees this as a means of "giving back." According to Elaine Fogel, author of </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Beyond Your Logo: 7 Brand Ideas That Matter Most For Small Business Success</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, "84 percent say whenever possible they try to purchase products or services that are socially or environmentally responsible."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">But Simon would otherwise disagree. "Honestly, I don't care [about their intentions]. If they are giving money to people who are in need of it, I believe that it's acceptable," Simon says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The point is not that donating money to charity organizations should be avoided. Charity is good. Donating is good. Attempting to manipulate and deceive the public is terrible. The ABS' focus should be on regulating alcohol sales and decreasing alcohol consumption rather than touching up its public image.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">And yet they say they are committed to public health and safety. That they donate because they care.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31987
33389	As a new deadly strain of the coronavirus breaks out, the U.S. rushes to distribute the vaccine in time	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On December 29, Colorado officials reported the first person in the U.S. to be infected by the new coronavirus variant, SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, that is more contagious than any other coronavirus variant known. Blazers express concern but also optimism as vaccine distribution lags.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/12/29/colorado-reports-first-known-us-case-new-covid-strain-uk/4079697001/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">This strand</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> was initially discovered in the United Kingdom. Many believe the strand is the reason for the U.K.’s recent spontaneous increase in COVID cases. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, explains that this new strand is possibly 70 percent more transmissible than other COVID&nbsp; variants.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair junior Steve Amonles believes that this is a cause for concern. “I think it's scary because maybe right now more people have it than we know. And we may have to go into quarantine again,” Amonles said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite this new information and the warnings from British officials, former President Trump and his administration didn’t test people coming in from the U.K. With the inauguration of President Biden, junior Kiera Lamb is optimistic that the covid relief plan will improve. “I’m hoping that there will be a better plan in place for vaccine distribution because at the moment vaccine distribution is very much at a state level. Hopefully there will be a better national sense on what we're actually going to do with the vaccine,” she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The U.S. has approved two vaccines so far: the Pfizer vaccine and the Moderna vaccine (thank God for the fact that the vaccines are still effective against these new variants). The plan for distributing the vaccines is split into phases. On December 3, the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">CDC </a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">stated that Phase 1a is healthcare workers. On December 22, the CDC announced the next two phases: Phase 1b is frontline workers (such as firefighters) and people ages 75 or older. Phase 1c is people ages 65-74 and those ages 16-64 that have a condition that weakens their immune system. The remaining essential workers are included in this phase as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Due to governmental mismanagement, the world is at a disadvantage but the U.S. is still determined to beat the coronavirus and distribute vaccines in a more mannerly way. “At the moment, I would say the coronavirus is winning the race,” Lamb said.&nbsp;</span></p>	32743
32904	Rapper's posthumous album shows his versatility and industry-changing potential.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pop Smoke's latest album </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon (Deluxe), </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">released on July 20,</span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">shows what his short, intense flare of a rap career could have blossomed into if he had more time. The album features his characteristic aggressive rap flows, raw lyrics, and gritty vocals, and yet it dares to expand in new directions by highlighting his softer side. Although it provides a long-overdue eulogy to the young rapper from Canarsie, Brooklyn, it is weighed down with heavy doses of cringe-worthy misogyny in several of his songs.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">His breakout single, "Welcome to the Party," featuring growling vocals and a nightmarish beat by 808Melo, became an anthem of Summer 2019 for many New Yorkers. In an interview with Genius, Pop Smoke said that he made the song at his house in just 30 minutes over a beat he found on YouTube. "I don't write at all, to be honest. I just go in there and go crazy," he said. His natural talent for rap music helped him gain attention quickly as an artist. Remixes of "Welcome to the Party" by British drill rapper Skepta and Queens rapper Nicki Minaj ignited the song's popularity and propelled Pop Smoke to fame.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When he was shot and killed at 20 during a home invasion on February 19, Pop Smoke was just beginning to enjoy his stardom as the figurehead for Brooklyn's drill music scene.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">(Deluxe)</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> also looks into the Panamanian and Jamaican American rapper's upbringing, which was entangled with gangs and violence, as well as his meteoric rise to fame. One of the surprises in this album is Pop’s willingness to show vulnerability, bringing his larger-than-life personality down to Earth as he contemplates his mortality and isolation.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In "Tunnel Vision," "Hotel Lobby," and "Paranoia," Pop chews out the threats from rival gang members that took aim at his life, refusing to back down from them. Throughout the album, he only briefly acknowledges the ever-present shadow of death. "Look, God gave me a lot in some months, but it could go in a second," he says in "Tunnel Vision." These tracks give the album an ominous overtone that makes Pop's life of fame and wealth feel fragile.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One of the most chilling and affecting songs on the album is "Got it On Me," which is a remix of 50 Cent's 2003 hit "Many Men (Wish Death)." In it, Pop stops to stare at his own mortality and pleads with those who would kill him to have mercy instead.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For the most part, Pop's album serves as an homage to his pleasure-seeking lifestyle, but on his song "Imperfections,"&nbsp;he finally mulls through his loneliness, which is a theme that had been kept private for the majority of his brief rap career.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32903"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While Pop's initial success was due to his knack for laying down gritty, boastful bars, this album features an impressive range of musical talent. Throughout the 34 tracks, Pop swivels between crooning R&amp;B melodies and his traditional drill style, proving that he excelled in multiple musical disciplines.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The album's sheer number of tracks can make it difficult to find its true gems. It displays a range of styles and tones that make it worth a listen from those who were already Pop Smoke fans, and those who are curious to get to know his music. A couple of the songs feel slapdash and trite, but any fan of hip-hop is sure to find several songs to add to their favorite playlist.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon (Deluxe), </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">displays some of Pop's best work. "For the Night," featuring rap stars Lil Baby and DaBaby and a dreamlike beat, seems destined for RapCaviar. Though the three artists each deliver their signature flows, they work together seamlessly to show drill music’s potential as a staple of mainstream music.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In “44 BullDog,” produced by MoraBeats and MobzBeatz, Pop's aggressive, bouncing energy makes the song's turbulent and sharp flow one of the best in the album.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another song that showcases Pop's talent is "Make It Rain," featuring Flatbush, Brooklyn rapper Rowdy Rebel, will please fans of Pop's earlier work in </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Meet the Woo </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">and </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Meet the Woo 2</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. Rebel manages to top Pop's bravado as he bursts onto the beat using a collect call from prison. This duo’s energy is unmatched in the rest of the album.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although Pop was not known previously for his melodies, he had a talent for them. His songs "Enjoy Yourself," produced by French Montana, and "She Feelin Nice," produced by Wondagurl branch out from his traditional style and show his knack for melodies that exude summertime bliss.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pop's array of songs in this album can be dizzying as they swap between rhythms and themes, but some of them stand out in startling clarity for their sexual objectification of women. In songs like "Diana," "Mood Swings," "West Coast S---," and "Creature," Pop's depiction of women mimics the stereotypes that have been repeated in countless rap songs. While it would be unfair to judge Pop alone, since misogyny has long been a toxic part of some mainstream rap music, it is important to call it out as long overdue for change.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a rap album, </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon (Deluxe) </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">is a rarity. It appeals to more than just fans of Brooklyn drill music as it includes club anthems, haunting melodies and romantic R&amp;B tunes. In his songs, Pop flaunts his aggressive confidence and then lets his guard down, bringing himself back to Earth. While his earlier albums showed that Pop was still coping with trauma from his tragically short life, his newest work is a sign that he was ready to move on, to grow as an artist and a person.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When asked by Vicky Inoyo of Earmilk, an online music publication, how he wanted people to remember him when his career was over, Pop replied that he would want them to know that "Pop Smoke changed the game." It can never be known what his lifelong impact could have been on the hip-hop industry, but what he accomplished in only 20 years is more than most will do in a lifetime.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32903
32385	The attack affected nearly 6,000 students across six schools	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/homepageContent/Naviance%20Data%20Incident%20Response-English-1.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Nov. 25</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) notified community members of a series of cybersecurity attacks against Naviance, the county's online college and career readiness platform. Occurring from Sept. 12 to 14, the attacks compromised the personal information of nearly 6,000 students across six schools including Blair.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The report followed an earlier MCPS </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/data-privacy-security/Data%20Breach%20Notification%20-%20Naviance_MERGED.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">statement</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> on Oct. 4 noting an attack from Oct. 3 against 1,343 students from Wheaton High School. Wheaton, Blair, Julius West Middle School, Argyle Middle School, Parkland Middle School and A. Mario Loiederman Middle School were targeted by the September breach.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The attack exposed both personal and academic information, including the names, birth dates, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, standardized test scores and GPAs of the students' whose accounts were accessed.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32384"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS Information Security and Data Privacy Engineer Tom Chapman explains that families shouldn't worry about the information exposed. Specifically, the student did not gain access to social security numbers or data that might be exploited financial harm. "The personal information accessed, such as home address and phone number, can usually be found in the yearbook and PTA directory either way," Chapman says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS framed the breach as a sequential brute force attack, but junior Kevin Higgs explains that it's much simpler than it sounds. At Blair, each account's default password is identical to the username, both of which are assigned as the student's ID number. Higgs postulates that the attacker merely iterated over potential ID numbers to gain access to the accounts. "Sequential brute force attack is a weird way to describe it," he says. "I would just call it 'knowing the password.'"</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The county police department (MCPD) believes the student has not yet shared any of the downloaded student information. The police are holding the attacker's devices for examination, but they have not found evidence of additional attacks or malign intention. In the meantime, they face disciplinary action as well as possible criminal charges.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chapman believes the attacker did not have a hostile motive. "Sometimes, people do things just to do them," he says. "You think you know how you'd potentially do it, and sometimes you follow through."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS forced a district-wide password reset for all Naviance accounts in response to the data breach. During counselor visits to junior classes, many students were unable to log into their account for the majority of the class period. For seniors such as Keawe Johnson, their transcripts sent through Naviance never successfully made it to their designated colleges.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Amidst the confusion, Blair administration has avoided informing students about the stolen information. Counselors dutifully reset student accounts, but did not explain the lapse in Naviance's function. Blair Principal Renay Johnson declined to comment on the issue.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In response to the incident, Naviance also updated its password requirement policies to prevent future breaches. Requirements include using 10 characters, an uppercase character and a number, according to Chapman.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chapman hopes that this breach will inform MCPS and improve students' data security. They aim to ensure that future platforms working with MCPS will have higher standards of protecting user data. "In recent years, MCPS has really been working toward protecting student information as a top priority," Chapman says. "While this incident doesn't really reflect that, I think it's an example of what to avoid in the future."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For now, however, Higgs notes that MCPS security vulnerabilities are a common sighting. He reported several flaws in MyMCPS Portal in March that still remain unresolved. "[By manipulating the URL], I can get all of my grades from all of my classes with just one section ID," Higgs says. "This could theoretically be expanded to get everyone's grades, which is an issue."</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS Director of Technology Peter Cevenini will attend the PTSA meeting on Dec. 17 to discuss the Naviance data breach.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32384
32902	With COVID-19 forcing people to stay home, the Netflix original “Desperados” brings adventure back into their lives	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32901"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Directed by L.P., “Desperados (2020)” follows the story of 30-year-old Wesley (Nasim Pedrad), a woman who is saddened by the fact that she cannot get a job and still has not found the love of her life. After a blind date with Sean (Lamorne Morris) goes wrong, Wesley trips on a crack in the sidewalk and wakes up to a handsome guy named Jared (Robbie Amell) offering her help. Desperate to find love, Wesley pretends to be someone else to get Jared to like her.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Unfortunately, Wesley can’t keep up her act after Jared doesn't contact her for five days. Thinking that she is being ghosted, Wesley and her friends write a harsh email only to find out that Jared was in an accident in Mexico and has been in a coma for the past five days.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With the help of her two best friends, Brooke (Anna Camp) and Kaylie (Sarah Burns), Wesley goes to monumental lengths to make sure Jared doesn’t see that email.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film does a great job of developing relationships between the protagonists. The three best friends all have good on-screen chemistry and the director also went in the right direction by choosing actors fluent in Spanish to play the hotel employees.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Typically, viewers favor movies with a simple plot that introduces a set of characters and provides an obstacle more than those movies that have too much going on, but “Desperados” proves otherwise. When the characters overcome a conflict and their goal is close in their sights, multiple additional conflicts arise.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Film writer Ellen Rapport throws so much at the main characters that some moments might make viewers want to stop just to take a deep breath and take in what just happened. With electricity lines falling on cars, child molestation accusations, trouble with police, electrocutions, dolphin attacks, goats nearly being run over, car flips, hikes random road and then going to a stranger’s quinceanera, this movie was truly one adventure that shows how much life there is yet to live.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the complicated plot, the theme is easily identifiable. Throughout the movie, we see the main character Wesley gain a newfound confidence in herself, which demonstrates to viewers that we don’t need to change who we are for other people to like us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Wesley’s persistence even after being thrown in Mexican jail has an amazing underlying message: stay dedicated to your goal, even if it is following a hot guy to a different country to commit burglary.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One downside of this movie is its lack of originality. This movie is very similar to other Hollywood hits such as “Girls Trip” and “Bridesmaid.” Like “Girls Trip,” this film shows best friends going on trips involving cheating husbands, divorce and assault. Like “Bridesmaids,”this movie shows a 30-year-old woman feeling like she is falling behind as her friends go on with their lives.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The similarities “Desperados” shares with other films doesn’t detract from the fact that not a second of this movie is boring.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From adventure to more adventure, “Desperados” teaches the importance of friendship in a person's life. The film is a must watch if you’re looking for a great laugh in sad times.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Desperados” is rated TV-MA and is available on Netflix.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32901
32140	The county’s initiative aims to address the mental and physical health of K-12 students	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For the 2019-2020 school year, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) launched the Be Well 365 program, which aims to improve the overall wellness of students K-12. As a part of this initiative, Blair implemented a bimonthly innovation period where students will receive lessons on restorative justice, mental health and relationship building. While the county’s effort to address the overall well-being of students is admirable, we will have to wait and see how successful these efforts are.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32139"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Student well-being is a widely-discussed topic among both students and faculty and schools are starting to address mental health in a variety of ways. Last school year, Blair conducted a schoolwide suicide prevention lesson during homeroom, which was met with a wave of student complaints and petitions because of the poor execution. “What they did last year was insensitive and really not well thought out,” junior Gemma Volz said. “It was almost mocking depression and suicidal issues.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">School administrators and county officials must have realized that something needed to be done because in the spring, MCPS announced the Be Well 365 initiative for the 2019-2020 school year. Superintendent Jack Smith claimed would improve students' overall health and academic performance. “At MCPS, we are committed to the academic success and to the physical, social and psychological well-being of every one of our students,” Smith </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/studentservices/wellbeing/index-new.aspx" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">said</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. “Student learning is our purpose, and we know that students perform better academically when they are healthy in body, mind and spirit.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The county is on the right path. It has been proven that kids perform better in school when they are mentally and physically healthy. “Our results showed that mental health was a stronger predictor of academic performance than other predictors and students whose mental health improved made better academic progress than students whose mental health did not improve or worsened,” a </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4443903/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">study</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> on the connection between mental health and academic outcomes concludes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The steps that Blair has taken following the launch of Be Well 365, such as the innovation period, also come with good intentions. Unfortunately, good intentions alone may not solve the problem. Although we are only a few weeks into the school year and Blazers have had only two innovation periods so far, it is clear that the lessons may not be the perfect solution.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While the lessons' goal of improving the well-being of students is admirable, they tend to come across as condescending rather than informative. Lessons comprised of cheesy poems and surface-level questions won’t help high schoolers face issues of mental health. Lessons should teach high schoolers to deal with their problems in a way that appeals to and works for teenagers, not little kids. Furthermore, these lessons have been thrown on teachers with little preparation or education. The attempts to talk about important problems such as mental health are sure to fall on deaf ears if teachers are not well prepared and passionate about the topic. In order to make this initiative successful, MCPS needs to arm teachers with better tools to address these issues.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though MCPS’ and Blair’s new initiatives fall short, it is comforting to know that county officials and school administrators are considering the well-being of students. “While innovation period isn’t the best, it’s at least normalizing it,” Volz said about depression and other issues faced by students. Even by initiating conversations about mental health, we are taking steps in the right direction, and in that regard, the launch of Be Well 365 is commendable.</span></p>	32139
33622	With so many outside commitments, high schoolers are finding it difficult to get a healthy amount of shut-eye	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All high schoolers know the struggle of grinding through an exhausting school day after not getting enough sleep the night before. It’s almost impossible to concentrate, let alone absorb all of the information the teacher is saying. Being productive is out of the question. Sleep is as necessary to sustaining life as is food and water. The amount of sleep you get dictates so much about the following day, your physical health, and your mental health.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33621"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">And especially now, sleep can be hard to find. Adriana Burgos-Ojeda, an administrator and vice principal at Blair, believes that the pandemic and online school has made it more difficult to get a healthy amount of sleep. “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The biggest thing that I’m noticing this year specifically is that we used to be starting at 9:00 and now we’re starting at 7:45, so it seems like some people forgot how to do that. The thing that happens most often is that folks might be staying up too late and not getting enough sleep,” she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/specialties/sleep-disorder-center/sleep-in-adolescents" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Nationwide Children’s Hospital</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, being tired decreases your cognitive ability. Your cognitive ability is an umbrella word for “attention, memory, decision making, reaction time, and creativity.” This explains why it is so difficult to get through a school day on little sleep.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">And being exhausted makes you irritable. According to </span><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-sleep-affects-mental-health-4783067" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">VeryWell Mind</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, “Poor sleep can make it much more difficult to cope with even relatively minor stress. Daily hassles can turn into major sources of frustration. You might find yourself feeling frazzled, short-tempered, and frustrated by everyday annoyances.” This is one of the reasons why poor sleep has been shown to be a detriment to mental health.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sleep also affects your physical health and athletic performance. According to </span><a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/Fulltext/2017/11000/Sleep_and_Athletic_Performance.11.aspx" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">a paper</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;written by Andrew Watson, a sports doctor at the University of Wisconsin medical school, “previous studies in team sports have demonstrated that competitive success in competition is related to increased sleep duration and quality.” He goes on to say that sleep is when your body heals from injuries and repairs muscles after exercise.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The amount of sleep one should get is determined by their age. As a teenager ages, their sleep schedules are biologically delayed by about two hours. This means that a student that once typically went to bed at 9 p.m. would now fall asleep around 11.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Nationwide Children’s Hospital </span><a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/specialties/sleep-disorder-center/sleep-in-adolescents" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">reports</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that high schoolers average around seven hours of sleep every night. And according to </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/are-blazzzers-getting-enough-sleep-33167/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">a survey run by SCO</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, almost 95 percent of Blazers don’t get nine hours of sleep every night. The </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/features/students-sleep.htm#:~:text=The%20American%20Academy%20of%20Sleep,10%20hours%20per%2024%20hours." target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">recommended amount of sleep for teenagers is about nine hours of sleep per night.</a></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">So how can you improve your sleep?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nicholas Losekamp, a psychology teacher at Blair says that having a specific schedule of when you go to sleep and wake up every day helps. “Have a specified time to go to bed and wake up each morning. Having that regular routine… helps you fall asleep quicker,” he says.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/teenagers-and-sleep-how-much-sleep-is-enough" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Johns Hopkins Medicine</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> suggests that a short nap after school would make you better-rested: “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">tired teens may benefit from a 30- to 45-minute nap before dinner. This is a better fix for sleep deprivation in teens than sleeping-in, which throws off their body’s sleep cycle.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Losekamp also insists that his biggest recommendation to someone looking to get more sleep is to stay off devices for as much time before you go to bed as possible. “The actual light from the device actually makes it harder to fall asleep right away. I’d recommend reading a book or something for the half hour to an hour before bed,” he says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Cyrilla Truong says that her phone is the main reason why she loses sleep. “Even if a lot of people hate to admit it, phones play a big role in our mental health both positively and mentally... My phone for sure keeps me a lot awake at night,” Truong says. She says that she typically gets around 6 hours of sleep every night.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 2017, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/debate-over-school-start-times-flares-anew/2017/01/01/9c23de06-cd37-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">MCPS actually pushed back high school start times by 20 minutes</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, moving it from 7:25 a.m. to 7:45 (where it currently stands). But this causes major logistical issues, like the fact that elementary and middle schoolers ride the same buses high schoolers do, so pushing the high school time back adds a major wrinkle to the bus plans.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/09/02/homework-could-have-an-effect-on-kids-health-should-schools-ban-it/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to the Washington Post</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, homework could be one of the biggest detriments to students’ sleep. The national average per student is 2.7 hours of homework every day. Taking this into account, if a student starts their homework at 8</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> p.m</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, they will be working until almost 11, and likely won’t go to sleep before 11:30. If this student has to wake up at 6 a.m. the next day, they will have gotten three hours less than the recommended amount.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cyrilla Truong says that it is imperative that a dialogue is formed between students and teachers about the amount of work assigned. “I think what we can do as students is to be more proactive with our teachers and explain that we need to have an easier workload sometimes. And they need to understand that sometimes the workload they give is too much and that they need to be better at distributing work,” she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With everything else in their lives, it is impossible to expect that high schoolers get a healthy amount of sleep every night. The connection between sleep and your well-being has been proven countless times over. It affects mental health, physical health, and academic performance. Anything that can squeeze a few more minutes of sleep improves every aspect of your well-being, and your grades. Simply put, if you proactively prioritize your sleep, tomorrow will be a much, much better day.</span></p>	33621
32482	Highlighting Blazer favorites from the decade	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Happy New Year Blazers! With the close of the decade, many people took the time to reflect on how much they have grown over the last ten years. For Blazers, the 2010s decade served as our childhood and it’s nostalgic to reflect on the memories and moments that have made these years special.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Kids born in the 2000s remember playing on their Nintendo DS, iPod touch or Wii. Many of us were excited to receive our first flip phones, while now it’s no longer uncommon to see younger children with iPhones, iPads and Nintendo Switches. From TV shows to music to clothing and everything in between, here are some flashbacks from the 2010s. Below are a few Blazer favorites:</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rubber Band Creations (SillyBandz and Rainbow Loom)</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32479"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">SillyBandz and Rainbow Loom were two of the biggest crazes in elementary school. Everyone went to stores such as Target or Five Below to secure the most unique shapes to trade during recess. These bands, which looked like regular rubber bands, were the key to being cool in school. Everyone had them, and would pull them off their wrists and play with them at school.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rainbow Loom had a similar effect on elementary school students. Eventually, as sophomore Lauren Riley said, schools started preventing students to bring the rubber bands due to the immense disruption they caused. “They banned [silly bands and rainbow loom] at our school. People were selling them and that wasn’t allowed,” Riley said. Both trends eventually died down in 2014.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Quality Television (Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network)</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32480"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Hi, I’m Miley Cyrus from </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hannah Montana </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">and you’re watching Disney Channel.” Each Disney star used a wand to draw out the Disney logo as they said this introduction to signal the beginning of their show.

Sophomore Grace Ebobola recalled several of her favorite things to watch from these platforms.&nbsp;“I remember S</span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">am and Cat,</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dexter’s Laboratory</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ni Hao, Kai-Lan</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> and</span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> High School Musical</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">,” Ebobola said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">High School Musical</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> centered high school experience around song and dance. </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam and Cat </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">focused on teenagers who lived alone and used to babysit other kids. We all dreamed of having unique experiences like these. However, Blazers claim that the new Disney shows do not have the same appeal as the old classics that they grew up watching. It’s sad but going into high school made us face its true reality. The old shows remind us of our childhood, while the new ones strike us as blatantly unrealistic or over-exaggerated.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Video-Sharing Social Networking (Vine, Musical.ly and TikTok)</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32481"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Most of us remember the 2009 song “Tik Tok” by Kesha. Little did we know, the TikTok app (which has no relation to the song) would become one of the most downloaded apps in 2018. TikTok’s success comes following the success of Vine (2013) where users created six-second-long, looping video clips and Musical.ly (2014) where users shared short lip-sync videos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Video sharing is the latest craze of the decade. Teenagers strive to get their 15-second TikToks on the For You page in the hopes that the videos will go viral. The TikToks feature a variety of content: collaborations, jokes and intense new dances. People who say that the platform is lame should take the time to try and make a good video; it’s not as easy as it looks.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fashion</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blazers added that some of the stores they used to love shopping at were Justice, Claire’s and Aeropostale. They recall being fans of light up sneakers and a return to 90s fashion in the form of mom jeans, chokers and scrunchies. Some of the other fashion fads of the decade include “dad” sneakers, tiny sunglasses, athleisure, feathers in hair, patterned leggings, cold shoulder tops, joggers and, of course, ripped jeans.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">35 Blazers were interviewed during One Lunch in early December.

32542	The Blair swim team closely wins their matchup scoring 196.5 - 173.5	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sat. Jan. 11, Blair faced one of their toughest opponents in division two. The Blazers traded points with the Patriots, a team who shared their undefeated overall record, before ultimately defeating them 196.5 - 173.5.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Just before the meet began, Wootton sparked a team-sprit battle as many of the Patriots donned angel-halo headbands to symbolize a counter theme to the Blair’s Blazer mascot. This would later prove ineffective as the Blair team consistently out-cheered Wootton as the first event began.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Diving gave the Blazers an early lead, as the girls took first and third while the boys maintained depth and placed second and third.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The 200-yard medley made it clear that the meet was going to be much tougher than others Blair had swum this season, with Wootton swimmers constantly on the trails of the boys and girls. The boys claimed the top two spots, while the girls secured second and third.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">200 freestyle oversaw the first of many close battles of the meet, as senior captain Max Casey-Bolanos broke away to narrowly claim first in the last few meters of the boy’s heat.&nbsp;Wootton girls put up a much harder fight, allowing the Blazers to only claim third place in the event.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">200 individual medley (IM) was another close race for the Blazers. The boys managed to claim the second and third positions, while Wootton locked the girls out of all positions but first.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">50 freestyle was overall the closest(and quickest) event of the afternoon, passing by in the blink of an eye as swimmers from both the boys and the girls formed an almost straight wall moving across the pool. Despite this,&nbsp;the Blazers fell just short on points as Wootton claimed first and third for the boys and second and third for the girls.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">100 fly was a strong performance from Blair with boys finishing and the girls finishing first and third in each heat. The Blazers continued this streak as they dominated the 100 freestyle with the boys claiming first and third, and the girls securing first and second in the respective heats.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32540"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">﻿The boys proved their superior overall stamina and were about to sweep 500 freestyle, but Wootton managed to swipe third place by a mere 0.05 seconds. The Wootton girls put much more pressure on the Blazers and fell just short of the position.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Wootton really pushed back for the boys in the 200-yard freestyle relay, only ceding second place to the Blazers.&nbsp;The girls dominated the relay and claimed the first and third position after another incredibly close battle for first.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">100 backstroke was one of the team’s best performances of the meet with the boys and girls each claiming the first position in their respective heats. This was followed up by Wootton’s last major push in a close-as-ever 100 breaststroke. The boys narrowly claimed second and third but the Wootton girls kept the Blazers from making a top-three finish.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The final event of the evening, the 400 free relay was a near sweep for the boys with first place stolen from behind as a result of a gargantuan push from Wootton’s lane four swimmers. The girls closed out the event placing winning a comfortable second place.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Looking back at the meet, Casey-Bolanos thinks that the Blazers can improve their finishes in the meets and championships to come. “Today’s meet went well, but many of the races we lost were lost in the last 15 yards of swimming. So there’s definitely something to work on there.” he reflects.</span></p>	32540
32908	The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that President Trump could not immediately end DACA; however, this ruling only provides temporary security. The only way to create lasting change is through legislation written by Congress.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On June 18 the Supreme Court ruled on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program preventing President Trump from ending the program immediately, one of President Trump’s core campaign promises. This decision is important, but only brings short term relief to around 700,000 DACA recipients or “Dreamers” residing in the United States. Chief Justice John Roberts made it clear through the </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-587_5ifl.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">majority opinion</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that the court was not basing their decision on the policies of DACA itself, but on the way in which the Trump Administration went about attempting to end DACA. The court ruled on the procedural aspect of ending DACA not the program itself.﻿&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32907"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although this court decision seems like a large win for the left and the many Dreamers in this country, this decision only holds so much power. The Supreme Court has not created longlasting, concrete change, rather a temporary solution. This ruling does not stop the Trump administration from ending DACA completely, meaning that it's still possible for them to go about ending DACA in a different way. If the Trump administration finds another way to eliminate DACA with stronger justification before his term runs out, the lives of many in this country will be severely affected.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With this court ruling, Congress must demonstrate that they want to protect these individuals permanently. The Trump administration has made it clear through President Trump’s words and proposed policies that he has no plans or desire to protect these individuals; therefore, Congress must take action. It is time for Congress to protect these Dreamers once and for all through permanent legislation.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Recipients of DACA are hardworking individuals who are an important part of our country.&nbsp;Over 450,000 undocumented immigrants attend college in the United States and about half of those individuals are eligible for DACA according to a report released by </span><a href="https://www.presidentsimmigrationalliance.org/2020/04/15/report-undocumented-students-in-higher-education-how-many-students-are-in-u-s-colleges-and-universities-and-who-are-they/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">the Presidents' Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Additionally, Dreamers pay federal income taxes and serve in the military. Many of these immigrants were brought to the United States as young children, and for them America is home.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For far too long lawmakers have not acted on DACA as they awaited the Supreme Court’s decision on this case; however, these lawmakers cannot wait anymore, as the livelihoods of around 700,000 individuals are in their hands. DACA recipients have lived in a constant state of uncertainty over their status in this country, and with an ongoing fear of deportation. These individuals should not have to face the consequences of the actions of lawmakers who choose not to act on this important issue. It is unfair to have to live this way, and now with the Supreme Court providing temporary relief for these individuals it is essential that Congress provides permanent safety and reassurance to the Dreamers in this country.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In a country so divided, a common issue on Capitol Hill is the lack of bipartisan support for many issues. This partisan gridlock can make it difficult to pass new legislation. Unlike many issues, DACA has support from both sides of the aisle. There is no reason for lawmakers not to take action, due to this bipartisan support. This support stretches beyond lawmakers and includes the public as well. According to a </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-opinion-poll-cbs-news/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">CBS News poll</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, 95 percent of Democrats and 73 percent of Republicans favor allowing immigrants brought to the country illegally as children to stay. A </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/us/trump-daca-supreme-court.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">New York Times </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;poll shows that 61 percent of Independents support keeping DACA in place as well. Additionally according to a </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/17/trump-supporters-dreamers-poll-323432" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Politico/Morning Consult</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> poll 69 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2016 say Dreamers should not be deported. DACA isn’t an issue just Democrats or liberal voters care about. With support from more than just Democrats, Congress has no excuse not to pass legislation to keep DACA in place.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Court’s ruling is gratifying for now. Dreamers are able to breathe a sigh of relief, but this relief will not last long unless Congress acts. The only way to achieve this long term security is for concrete legislation to be passed and enacted. Congress must move quickly to pass legislation to protect these individuals who call America home.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32907
33283	Nuevos retos y dificultades a causa de la pandemia.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAlgunos estudiantes afrontan desafíos este año escolar a causa de la pandemia. A la misma vez los padres y la sociedad sienten el mismo peso. La pandemia causada por el COVID-19 ha forzado a que la sociedad y la comunidad estudiantil de Blair se vean comprometidos al alterar las rutinas diarias, personales, escolares y laborales.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEste año escolar ha tenido varios cambios, el más notable siendo las clases virtuales. Uno de los mayores retos ha sido que algunos estudiantes han tenido que cuidar a sus hermanos menores o ayudar a su familia con los quehaceres de la casa mientras están conectados a sus clases.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLa cuarentena ha sido un golpe muy fuerte para los padres, ya que muchos de ellos han perdido sus trabajos y algunos han sido desalojados debido a no tener ningún tipo de ingreso para pagar su renta. Muchos de ellos han enfrentado la necesidad de buscar un trabajo diferente, en los cuales trabajan muchas horas por un salario bajo. Otro gran reto es que algunos padres se van a trabajar con la inseguridad de saber si sus hijos se conectan a sus clases.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMuchos de los estudiantes han tenido problemas con el aprendizaje virtual. A varios no les gusta la idea de tener clases en línea, debido a que no aprenden de la misma forma como en un entorno escolar.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tJoselin Valeriano es una estudiante de décimo grado, quien nació en El Salvador y recién vino a los Estados Unidos el octubre pasado. Ella empezó a asistir a Blair en enero, pero lastimosamente en marzo cancelaron las clases debido a la pandemia. Ella enfrenta dificultades manejando la tecnología y a la misma vez tiene que lidiar con tener que aprender inglés. Para ella, el reto se multiplica. “Es un poco difícil pero más que todo no es aprender si no que es entender. Porque algunos maestros hablan muy rápido y todos los que están en mis clases ya son nacidos aquí”, dice Valeriano.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33282"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Además de este reto, hay otros como tener que cuidar a niños pequeños. En el caso de Valeriano, durante sus clases ella tiene que cuidar a sus primos de 5 y 10 años. “A veces se pelean y a mi me están preguntando algo y tengo que estar diciéndole que no estén peleando, o cuando es mi hora de almuerzo aprovecho y le pregunto si tienen hambre o tienen que usar el baño”. Ella añade, “casualmente a las 12:30 le da hambre y me toca estar en la clase y cocinándole y dándole de comer al de 5 años porque todavía no puede comer solo”.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tValeriano también dice que para ella, “Es muy importante saber cómo manejar nuestro estrés, ansiedad, frustración para relajarnos. A veces salgo a caminar por la tarde o escucho&nbsp;música porque eso me relaja mucho”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otra estudiante del grado once, Melany Andrades, dice que tiene que cuidar a su hermano de seis años durante sus clases. Necesita ver si él se conecta a sus clases o si él está prestando atención mientras ella también está tomando sus clases.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tComo para muchos estudiantes, los primeros días fueron estresantes. “Es difícil porque cada 20 minutos tengo que mirar a mi hermano o a veces entra a mi cuarto y tengo que llevarlo de vuelta a su cuarto'', cuenta Andrades. Con respeto a las clases de su hermano, Andrades sigue, “Depende de lo que pasa en clase si no le gusta la lección o lo que dice el profesor él no presta atención en absoluto”.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAunque los padres de Andrades están conscientes de que ella tiene sus clases, le piden que haga quehaceres de la casa. Esto causa que ella no entienda o pierda el hilo de las lecciones. Andrades entiende que sus profesores están haciendo lo mejor que pueden para enseñar a los estudiantes en estas circunstancias, pero ella prefiere estar cara a cara con sus profesores.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEs cierto que los estudiantes han tenido muchas dificultades durante esta pandemia con el aprendizaje y la economía. Esto se debe a que un gran número de los estudiantes trabajaban después de la escuela para ayudar a sus familias. A raíz de esto muchos tuvieron que abandonar los trabajos, lo cual afectó mucho a las familias que no tenían los suficientes ingresos para pagar la comida, renta y otros tipos de pagos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLas agencias y las escuelas del condado están ayudando a muchas familias con la entrega de comida, tarjetas de dinero y otros tipos de asistencia, las cuales les están siendo de mucho beneficio a familias que no tienen los suficientes ingresos para abastecerse y alimentar a sus hijos.</span></p>	33282
33243	MCPS, it's time to make African American Studies a graduate requirement	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The movement to address America's deeply-rooted systemic racism gained momentum this past year as White Americans finally woke up to what Black and Brown Americans have been shouting about for decades.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Education is the foundation of antiracism, and public school systems have a responsibility to build not only this foundation, but an equitable, diverse, and inclusive environment for their students.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">How should MCPS ensure that its students graduate with a deep knowledge of the experiences and contributions of African Americans? Is the answer to require students to take an African American Studies course? Is to integrate this information into the broader curriculum?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Why not do both?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS should establish an introductory African American Studies course as a high school graduation requirement, and MCPS teachers should give their students more opportunities to learn about the contributions of African Americans to their respective disciplines.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33242"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At Blair, African American History is a half-semester elective. Rahman Culver taught this course for a year before he became Blair's Diversity and Inclusion Coordinator. As he describes it, the purpose of the course is "really about exploring… the peoples of the African diaspora and developing a mastery… of the wealth and the breadth of those experiences and the contributions of these communities."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The African American Studies curriculum can build on the existing African American History curriculum to make it a more interdisciplinary course that teaches antiracism in addition to African American history and culture.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The process of dismantling the institutions of racism in the United States begins with educating a new generation of Americans about the experiences and contributions of Black Americans. The goal of African American History is to promote intellectual curiosity, which "helps to change culture… Culture changes values, values change behaviors, and behaviors change institutions," Culver says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If MCPS can foster a culture of intellectual curiosity towards the contributions and experiences of African Americans, the effects will be long-lasting. In order for our educational system to dismantle its long-standing systemic racism and become more equitable, its students must deepen their understanding of not just the legacy of racism, but the contributions and successes of the Black community in American society. "That's what we need to really dismantle the systemic racism that folks have been focused and honed in on over the last several months," Culver says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The reform to our education doesn't stop with requiring high schoolers to take a half-semester African American Studies course; that's just the beginning. It will be the responsibility of the county to develop guidelines for its teachers to build inclusion and diversity into their lessons. Whether it's AP Biology or Foundations of Tech, there must be spaces within each class where students have opportunities to explore the contributions of African Americans to that discipline.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mary Oliver is one of eight Black sophomores enrolled in the Communication and Arts Program (CAP) at Blair. "It's important that we acknowledge our country's past. Those ugly parts are what our country is built off of, and the way it was shaped into what it is today. So I think it's very important that it's a part of what we learn in school," she says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">African American Studies wouldn't just teach the "ugly parts," either. "The African American Experience also includes a lot of joy, a lot of creativity, a lot of dreaming and visions for all of the possibilities that could be," Culver says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Max Pauls is also a sophomore at Blair. They emphasize how the non-Magnet curriculum at Blair is lacking in both Black and Queer voices. "I feel like [the course] could help shape people into better people by understanding different perspectives," they say.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">By the time students graduate from MCPS, they should have a mastery of the experiences and contributions of African Americans. Oliver feels like "the entirety of what we learned [freshman] year was centered around straight, white, cis, male history. I honestly wouldn't say that we acknowledged too much about Black History."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On CAP's website, it states that it is "committed to diversity and equipping students and staff with anti-racist curriculum." In tenth grade, students learn about intersectionality, privilege, and systemic oppression. In eleventh grade, students study Baldwin, Malcolm X, and contemporary BIPOC writers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS teachers must find ways to educate themselves and their students on the contributions of African Americans to their particular subject. The county must make African American Studies a requirement. These are both critical steps in ensuring that MCPS students are part of the solution, not the problem, when it comes to fighting systemic racism.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33242
31733	Community members shared questions and concerns about school boundaries and diversity	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Tuesday, Feb. 26, more than 500 Montgomery County students, educators, parents and community members attended radio journalist Kojo Nnamdi's event "Kojo Roadshow: A Town Hall on School Diversity in Montgomery County" at the Silver Spring Civic Building. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nnamdi moderated the conversation between the community and Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) officials on school boundaries, diversity and the achievement gap. The discussion was recorded as an installment of The Kojo Nnamdi Show's 20th-anniversary celebration.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The evening began with a mock debate between members of the Springbrook High School debate team on whether or not increasing diversity in MCPS would close the achievement gap. One side argued that diversity allows students to be "exposed to the challenges, world-views and experiences of students from a broad range of ethnic, economic or racial groups." The other side countered that while redrawing district boundaries may increase diversity "in the optical sense," they are unable to close the opportunity gap in practice.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31732"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following the debate, a panel composed of Chief Academic Officer Maria Navarro, Montgomery County Board of Education member Shebra Evans, Student Member of the Board Ananya Tadikonda and Parent-Teacher Association leader at Summit Hall Elementary Oscar Alvarenga fielded questions on school boundaries and diversity.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Jan. 8, the Board passed Tadikonda's proposal calling for a countywide school boundary analysis. According to Tadikonda, the study ensures that the Board is "looking at the county as one big picture" in regards to facility utilization and student body diversity issues. The data will arm the Board to make informed decisions about boundary changes.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Alvarenga argued that boundary changes are not the answer. "I don't think tearing communities apart, busing students from one neighborhood to another neighborhood just to make it look better on paper is good," he said. Due to the large growth of minorities in Montgomery County in the last 50 years, he believes the county's demographics will continue changing. "It's an organic thing that's going to continue happening in Montgomery County, and I don't think we should force it and spend millions of dollars to make it look the way it's going to look as it continues to grow," he said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Attending students also shared their thoughts about intraschool diversity and how it impacts their experiences at school. "I've seen that despite the diversity in the numbers at my school, friend groups have still been extremely segregated and prejudiced against each other. Something we really need to reconcile as a county going beyond optical diversity is changing our cultural view of who can be excellent and who can achieve," Richard Montgomery freshman Uma Fox said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Community members brought up concerns about factors besides diversity that widen the student achievement gap, such as unstable housing, large student-to-teacher ratios and the consortiums.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Listen to the show on </em><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/381443519/the-kojo-nnamdi-show" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>NPR</em></a><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> or </em><a href="https://player.fm/series/the-kojo-nnamdi-show-1337601/kojo-roadshow-a-town-hall-on-school-diversity-in-montgomery-county" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>PlayerFM</em></a><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</em></p>	31732
32262	New law effectively prevents anyone under 21 from getting their hands on tobacco products, but increased reinforcement is necessary	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Oct. 4, a 17-year-old from the Bronx in N.Y. became the first teenager in the U.S. to die from a vaping-related illness. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated case. In recent years, over 1299 cases of vaping-related diseases </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/10/vaping-illness-cases-surge-1-299-deaths-rise-26/3929535002/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">have been reported</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> in the US, along with 26 deaths in 21 states. Vaping is an increasingly popular trend among high schoolers, and it is no longer uncommon to see students being hospitalized as a result of this addiction.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32256"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Sept. 30, Maryland implemented </span><a href="https://tobacco21.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Tobacco 21</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, raising the minimum age to buy cigarettes, vapes and other tobacco products from 18 to 21. </span><a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Release-Maryland-becomes-13th-state-to-raise-minimum-legal-sales-age-for-tobacco-products-to-21.aspx" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to the Maryland Department of Health</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> (MDH), </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">the law will prevent 255,000 Marylanders between ages 18 to 20 from developing a nicotine addiction. If this is true, Tobacco 21 has served its purpose: drastically reducing the amount of teens wandering into the realm of nicotine.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The current vaping epidemic can be attributed to e-cigarettes being marketed as healthier alternatives to cigarettes. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Still, the nicotine has multiple harmful effects, with the most severe being death. Yet smoking rates have only increased. Among U.S. high school students, tobacco usage increased 40 percent and e-cigarette usage grew by 78 percent between 2017 and 2018, equating to an additional 1.5 million tobacco users. It is time that the government steps in to keep the public healthy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Maryland is the thirteenth state to adopt Tobacco 21, and other locations have already set a precedent. Per </span><a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Release-Maryland-becomes-13th-state-to-raise-minimum-legal-sales-age-for-tobacco-products-to-21.aspx" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">MDH</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, implementing Tobacco 21 in Chicago resulted in a decline of more than 30 percent in cigarette and electronic smoking device use among 18- to 20-year-olds. Raising the age to 21 will drastically reduce the number of contacts that minors have who are able to purchase tobacco products.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair security assistant Ronald West says a reason vaping is so common in high schools is that at 18, seniors used to be legally able to buy the products. “[Tobacco 21] will make it more difficult to get the product. Some kids here are 18, so at 21 it should really minimize how many students are able to get it without getting it through some other illegal means,” West says. Tobacco 21 will have a ripple effect in high schools, as students in lower grades will no longer be able to ask their senior friends to buy them vapes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On the other hand, counselor Kirk Simms points out that some companies looking for profit will sell these products to students regardless of their age. “Just like alcohol, where underage people can get alcohol, there’s always a loophole where teenagers or young people can get drugs or vaping products,” Simms says. These companies can now be prosecuted for selling to minors, but this entails getting caught. Those breaking the law will not confess, so it's up to the authorities to prevent illegal exchanges.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Joseph Byler brings up the online market, another impediment to the effectiveness of Tobacco 21. “Not every state has raised the age to 21, so you can go to a site that’s based in, say, Pennsylvania and order whatever you want online from there,” Byler says. To tech-savvy teens, this is a simple process that makes it easy to get their hands on the banned products.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The solution to both these issues is tighter reinforcement. Tobacco 21 is the government’s first step in the right direction. Further improvements, including more serious regulation of companies (both online and in person), is a necessity.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Ultimately, it is impossible to control every factor contributing to adolescent drug use. Security assistant Brian Leatherwood says the law is simply slowing down the process. “I think if someone wants to get it, they get it one way or the other. Older siblings, friends or I have even heard parents buy it,” Leatherwood says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nonetheless, Tobacco 21 will serve to benefit teens who have not tried these tobacco products, as it will severely limit their access. While it may not stop addicts from getting their hands on nicotine, it will prevent a new generation from dipping their toes in the product. This is the overall purpose of the law, and coupled with stricter enforcement, it will be a major success.&nbsp;</span></p>	32256
32074	How cafeteria staff get food to hungry Blazers every day	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The cafeteria is an essential part of school life for many students at Blair. However, many do not know the intricacies of how the cafeteria functions and what cafeteria staff must do every day to get lunch to Blazers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A typical school day starts with a few cafeteria workers preparing for breakfast. "We come in the morning and make sure the line is up to par, cook breakfast in the oven and put it out when the kids come to serve it," cafeteria worker Lashawn Thomas says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32073"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">More workers arrive later in the day in preparation for the lunch rush. The cafeteria staff work four-hour shifts to cover breakfast, lunch or supper. Everybody is assigned a role to get the cafeteria up and running. "When we all get in here, everybody has their position that they have to do, but we work together as a team," cafeteria worker Sylvia Barnes explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cafeteria manager Christine Blanton is in charge of duties such as deciding which workers will work where and what food will be served based on a government-provided menu. Blanton tries to choose foods that Blazers would enjoy. If Blanton believes that kids will not eat a certain lunch, she chooses an alternate meal to get more students in the lunch lines. "We look at the menu and see what's on it for the day and then we'll break it up to see what the kids like versus what they don't like. If they wouldn't eat it, I'm not going to serve it to them," Blanton says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blanton also tries to be conscious of Blazers' eating restrictions by keeping certain foods that many students would not be able to eat off the school menu. "We have a lot of kids that don't eat pork, so I don't do cold cuts. I try not to do pork at all in my kitchen," Blanton says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since the switch to one-lunch, there has been a significant change in how the cafeteria prepares for lunch. Last year, the cafeteria workers were able to cook lunches in two batches and had more breathing room to prepare for each lunch. With one-lunch, cafeteria workers have to prepare more food at once and have no breaks during this time period. "Lunch is very hectic. One lunch is full of consistent flow, nothing is batch-cooked anymore because everything's got to go out at once," Thomas explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One-lunch has also contributed to longer lunch lines this school year. In order to combat the long wait time for lunches, a new cart has been opened on the second floor. "The kiosk is supposed to help us get the lunches out so the kids don't have to wait in line as long," Blanton says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After lunch ends, staff cleans up and prepares for dinner provided by the supper program. By the end of the school day, two cafeteria workers are left to serve dinner since there are much fewer students getting these meals. However, this reduced amount of staff can be taxing on those who work the afternoon shift.&nbsp;"Workers come in at 2:00 p.m. and begin to serve from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. You’re typically supposed to get a break, but sometimes it's impossible because you have to prepare for 200 to 220 kids, which gets tiresome," Thomas explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To keep up with the large number of meals that need to be served, the cafeteria receives deliveries twice a week in the morning before school to restock. "We get deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We have a thousand pieces come in: chicken patties, hot dogs, pizzas, utensils, ketchup, waters, anything and everything that you eat or drink here," Blanton says. After getting these deliveries, staff have to sort through the different products to figure out where to store them.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Due to the cafeteria's fast-paced environment, workers are standing during their entire shift, which can get exhausting. "We're basically on our feet the whole time we're here, from the time we walk in the doors to the time we leave," Barnes says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cafeteria workers still enjoy their jobs due to the connections they create with students. "I love my kids, the relationships that I built with my kids," Thomas says. Workers find both the connections made with Blazers and making lunches rewarding. "I love kids and I love food, so what better way of combining them both?" Barnes says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The cafeteria staff at Blair will continue to be an integral part of the Blair community valued by both students and staff alike for the distant future.</span></p>	32073
32639	The gang is finally in the Good Place — what's next?	<p>Chapter 51 was called "Patty," and if you're confused about why, you'll find out in just a second. As always, there will be some spoilers, so be forewarned. If you don't mind, stick around until the end to hear our comments! Sit back, relax, and enjoy. With that, let's jump right into a quick plot summary.&nbsp;</p><p>The last episode of the show left off with the four humans, Michael, and Janet finally climbing into the magical hot air balloon that would take them to the real Good Place. Chapter 51 opens with a beautiful shot of the group cruising through the galaxy, which is complete with adorable flying puppies, before finally arriving at the Good Place. They are greeted by the Good Place architects. The architects, much to everyone's surprise, invite Michael to go to a swearing-in ceremony to officially become a Good Place architect, which immediately gets rid of any of his doubts that he doesn't belong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The four humans make their way into their official welcome party, and find that it's a mishmash of all the things they love most — the Jacksonville Jaguars, celebrities to gossip about, shrimp, and philosophers like Hypatia of Alexandria, who Chidi immediately peppers with questions.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32517"></div><p>At the same time, at his ceremony, Michael obsesses over the scroll that will put him into his new architect position. But as soon as he signs his name, the Good Place architects drop a bomb — evidently, Michael didn't read the fine print. The scroll actually stated that all the architects quit, putting Michael solely in charge of the Good Place from then on! Michael freaks out a little bit and goes to find the others.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Hypatia, who goes by "Patty," tells Chidi and Eleanor she needs to talk to them urgently. She tells them that the Good Place is actually not that good after all. She says that everyone is at risk of having their brains become zombie-fied because they are stuck in an infinite timeline where they run out of things to do. Chidi and Eleanor run back to the others to warn them, and they take advantage of Michael's new position of authority to create a plan. Michael remembers that long ago, Eleanor told him that people find joy in life because they know they'll die one day, so he decides to give people the option of leaving the Good Place if they so choose. They present the plan to everyone in the Good Place and it's met by a standing ovation.&nbsp;</p><p>The episode ends with the humans going to their houses in the Good Place. Tahani's is a mansion, Jason's is a replica of Stupid Nick's Wing Dump, his favorite restaurant in Florida, and Chidi and Eleanor's overlooks a beautiful coastline. As they take in the view, Chidi and Eleanor realize that the Good Place isn't really about a place at all — it's about time with the people you love.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of the ending, I found Chidi's quote at the end of the episode extremely heartwarming, but it also sums up the overarching message that the writers try to communicate through the show. In Chidi's words, "That's what the Good Place is… it's not even really a place, really, it's just having enough time with the people you love." Throughout the entire series, the gang has been all over, living through the Bad Place over 800 times, reuniting on earth, and visiting places such as the Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes and the Judge's office. After 50 chapters, they finally make it to the Good Place, but Chidi's analysis says it all— because they were enjoying their time with each other regardless of their location, the Good Place was the journey, not the physical place that was their original end goal. In a similar vein, their lives didn't suddenly improve and turn to paradise because they reached the Good Place— it was the journey of personal growth and helping each other that led them to become better people.</p><p>Maybe, when extrapolating the lessons from Chidi and the Good Place to use back in our own lives, we should focus on the journey and experiences that help us grow, and our materialistic goals will follow along as a by-product.&nbsp;</p><p>The gang also makes a key point when developing their solution for the Good Place— humans tend to only appreciate things when they know they might lose them. Just as you might not miss your jacket until you lose it, they find that the Good Place inhabitants can't enjoy their time in paradise simply because they're taking it for granted. However, I'm not sure if this is a viable solution for everything— if we want to truly appreciate something, should we just have less of it?</p><p>I think another important, albeit smaller, lesson to take from this episode is that history is complex. When the gang gets to the Good Place, Chidi immediately asks if his idols, Aristotle and Socrates are there. Janet informs him that they're actually in the Bad Place because they supported slavery. Obviously, in our world today, a lot of historical figures as painted as faultless, but Chidi's realization just reminds us that things are not always what they seem, and that we should evaluate everyone's positives and negatives.&nbsp;</p><p>As always, there were lots of references to the real world in this episode. Tahani roasts the popular music festival Coachella when she compares it to the Good Place, saying both of them make people become glassy-eyed zombies. Eleanor references those creepy Instagram ads in an apparent jab at big data. And, my personal favorite, the architects brainstorm a list of improvements for the Good Place that includes the item: "Wait for Beyonce to come and have her fix it." Honestly, that sounds like a good plan to me :) Also, I'm sure everyone noticed that Lisa Kudrow made a cameo as Hypatia in this episode, giving us a mini "Friends" crossover!&nbsp;</p><p>Let's talk about our predictions for the show's finale. What do you see in the future, Vivian? I think I'm expecting a happy ending for this show— I'm surprised that Judge Gen, Shawn, and Vicky weren't able to make it into this episode, but I wonder if they will be there for the finale [stuff about where they go]. Or, I wonder if the new humans who pass their afterlife test will also join the Good Place— instead of a paradise filled with people from the prehistoric times or the Renaissance. Will there be yet another problem to solve, or will the Good Place writers give us the happy, cutesy scenes we've been waiting for? I personally think there will be another small problem, even if it's a dilemma that involves just one person. Since we have a whole hour next week, I'm sure the characters will go through something that, once again, reinforces their relationships and gives them the typical happy ending.&nbsp;</p><p>We should also consider this episode's title when predicting next weeks ending— it's called "Whenever You're Ready." It does remind me of the solution they present at the end of this episode— that the Good Place residents can walk through the final doors to a peaceful end when they're ready to conclude their experience in paradise. Will Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani leave when they're ready? Do you think we'll see some montages that span many Jeremy Bearimy's (as the end of shows often do, skipping into the future and tying the series together)? Or will Michael Schur and the other writers leave the humans' future up to our imaginations?&nbsp;</p><p>I guess we have to wait until Chapter 52 to find answers to all of those exciting questions, so we hope you'll tune in next week for the last episode of The Good Cast.

32566	The Blazers win 84-75 against the Warriors	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair boys' varsity basketball team (6-1) defeated Sherwood (4-2) by a score of 84-75 in their fourth home game of the season on Thursday night. The game, originally scheduled for Jan. 7, was moved to Jan. 9.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After winning the tip-off, the Blazers scrambled to take the lead. A minute and 30 seconds into the game, junior guard Alfred Worrell made two consecutive free throws to kick off the game with Blair up 2-0. With baskets by senior forward Bakarr Bangura, senior guard Liam Olagbaju and junior guards Jacob Briggs, Michael Ayala and Worrell, the Blazers stayed in the lead. Towards the end of the quarter, the Warriors steadily caught up and ended the first quarter in a 16-16 tie.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32564"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Eager to break the tie, both teams went at it for an intense second quarter. Blair briefly fell behind Sherwood for the first minute, but came springing back into action to bring the score to 26-19. Ayala played exceptionally, making multiple three-pointers and scoring 11 points in the quarter. Though the Blazers were in the lead, the score remained close throughout. Thanks to two successful free throws from Worrell, the second quarter ended with Blair up 41-32.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Coach Damon Pigrom took notice of the Blazers' successful moves. "I thought we played well in spurts. We got stops when we needed it," Pigrom said. Senior center Leon Johnson echoed this sentiment. "We had good breaks [and] we ran our offense better than any other game so far," Johnson said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Starting the third quarter, Sherwood made a comeback, putting the Warriors in the lead 42-41. A three-pointer from Briggs, though, put the Blazers back in the lead with junior center Tommy Waltz-Chesnaye, Johnson, Bangura and Worrell helping to maintain the lead. The quarter came to an end, with a close score of 64-58.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The game reached its climax in the fourth quarter as Blair was winning by just six points. With only two and a quarter minutes left, Blair's victory was sure. The Warriors tried but failed to mount a comeback, and the Blazers held on to win 84-75.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Johnson said that the Blazers were playing against an experienced team but still managed to play well. "Overall, it was a pretty good game. We were up against a team that knew what they were doing," Johnson said. "[But] we went out there and got it done."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But Johnson pointed out that the team can still improve on its defense. "We still need to work on being in our spots defensively," Johnson said. Although the team is playing well so far, Pigrom has set higher standards. "The players have set some goals and in order to achieve them, there are things that we have to clean up," Pigrom said.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game on Monday, Jan. 13 against Kennedy at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	32564
32326	The obscure Thanksgiving genre is the reason people hop to Christmas music right after Halloween.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"If someone plays Christmas music on Halloween, I'm egging their house. I mean I'm going to roast them. Whether or not it's done in egg form, is up to me," junior Luka Smith says. There is a general consensus that Christmas melodies have no place in our playlists before Halloween.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, after Halloween, we seem to shift gears directly into Christmas season. We turn to our Christmas playlists, pull out our Santa hats, and start putting up decorations throughout our houses. But in all this excitement, we forget about one thing: Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Have you ever tried to find Thanksgiving music so you won’t be judged for listening to Christmas music? Because I'll save you the effort: Good Thanksgiving music really doesn't exist. Yes, you'll find a couple songs here and there about giving thanks, but there is no alternative to the real thing. The attempts by people singing about turkey are truly laughable.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Coltin Chao agrees. "Pandora has a [playlist] for Thanksgiving music and its terrible. I listened to one song and stopped. Thanksgiving music is a thing that sort of exists but really shouldn't," Chao says. This valiant effort to get into the Thanksgiving spirit is noble, but has little reward.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32325"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Below are a few songs that you can consider adding to your holiday playlist. They may not be top notch, but they’ll be sure to give a quick laugh or just a brief reminder that Thanksgiving is coming up soon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqGkbVXSaKU" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><strong>Thanksgiving Song</strong></a><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">” by Adam Sandler</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When I asked Blazers if they had heard any Thanksgiving songs, this is the only one that occasionally came up.&nbsp;It’s a song about turkey and all the words that rhyme with turkey. Sandler originally performed the song on Saturday Night Live in 1992. He sang the tune in a high falsetto voice and can be seen stifling giggles as he sings the hilariously absurd lyrics. From a musical standpoint, it’s obviously a joke. But it’s a memorable one.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OeR5XBEahU" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><strong>Thank U, Next</strong></a><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">” by Ariana Grande</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The second song Blazers were quick to mention, probably because of the fact that the title contained the word “thank” was “Thank U, Next.” The song is widely known as a breakup anthem, which has absolutely no relation to Thanksgiving. Grande sings about all her ex-boyfriends and the realizations she's had in the aftermaths of those relationships. But if this song somehow reminds you of Thanksgiving, by all means go ahead and give it a listen.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EL4njT8g98" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><strong>Macy’s Day Parade</strong></a><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">” by Green Day</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Macy’s Day Parade” is Billie Joe Armstrong's commentary on commercialism, and how people focus too much on the material things (Macy's sponsors an annual Thanksgiving Day parade in the US). The song explains that he craves something, but it's not material; all he wants is hope in his life. It brings the core values of Thanksgiving to the forefront.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyGY2NfYpeE" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><strong>We are Family</strong></a><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">” by Sister Sledge</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sure, this song is technically not about Thanksgiving. But “Let it Snow” is not technically about Christmas either. “We are Family” is a celebration of family and togetherness.&nbsp;The chorus and the title reference the fact that the group are the four sisters of a family.The song has since gone on to be used as a general expression of solidarity. Thanksgiving is a time to celebrate with family, so it makes sense for this song to make a greater appearance in the holiday season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOrxFY14D8w" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><strong>I’ve Got Plenty to be Thankful For</strong></a><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">” by Bing Crosby</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is the tip of the iceberg of songs about thankfulness. Thanksgiving, as obvious by its name, is about giving thanks. So what better than songs that follow this theme? The truth is they’re not memorable. Crosby sings about how he is grateful for what he has, even though he doesn’t have much. Its a wholesome tale, but one that has been told countless times and has lost originality. Its worth a listen, but not much more than that.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egIB7tYW80M" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><strong>Thanksgiving Prayer</strong></a><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">” by Johnny Cash&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cash, an old and trusty country music favorite, gives yet another perspective on being grateful. He sings of cursing his aching feet and measly pay. But then corrects his tune, remembering that he's really doing fine despite his troubles. Giving thanks for these simple gifts is so important during the busy holiday season.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As you’ve likely realized, these songs can’t even begin to compare to the endless productions of Christmas. Until songwriters start to focus on Thanksgiving day, it makes sense for anyone and everyone to jump right into the Christmas season. This doesn’t mean that Thanksgiving should be forgotten, but its music definitely should be left behind.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	32325
32433	The Blazers are still undefeated after beating the Colonels 68-24	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair's Varsity Girls' Basketball team (3-0) dominated the court with a 68-24 victory over the Magruder Colonels (0-3) on Friday night.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though they lost the tip-off, the girls started the night off strong with junior caption and guard-forward Peyton Martin scoring the first four points. Magruder’s defense, though aggressive, did not rattle Blair. The Blazers’ strong communication and teamwork allowed them to rapidly shoot and score. Every player that stepped out onto the court made a basket, with junior guard Kate Hildebrant, senior guard Zoe Abramson, and freshman guard Amelia Martin taking the lead. Abramson played tough defense, consistently driving Magruder players out of bounds. With the exception of a few shaky passes and shots, the Blazers were unstoppable; the second quarter ended 38-8 in Blair’s favor.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32432"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After halftime, the Colonels were determined to make a comeback, relentlessly pushing through the Blazers and scoring eight points in a row. The Blazers fell on the court numerous times, but the girls rapidly picked themselves up each time and continued playing with smiles on their faces. Despite Magruder’s best efforts, Blair widened the gap in the score as the game continued on to the fourth quarter, where every player on the court contributed to the increasing score by making shot after shot. The game ended with the Blazers winning 68-24.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers showed immense technique throughout the game.. “I could’ve had better defense and less fouls, but I think when I was going to the basket I went hard,” Hildebrant said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The wide score gap enabled the team to try out and perfect several different plays. “We were up by a lot most of the game but it was good practice for us because we’re up against [Quince Orchard] on Monday; it was a good opportunity for us to run a lot of different plays and stuff,” Hildebrant said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Abramson included that the team needs to keep calm when passing. “We need to make sure we’re not throwing the ball to the other team. Sometimes we get too eager to go and score right away; we have 30 seconds on the shot clock to find a good shot,” Abramson said, regarding some of the rougher plays.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Overall, the night was a success. “We all hustled a lot and there was good positivity on the court. It was fun. It was a fun game to play in,” Hildebrant concluded.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, January 3rd against the Northwood Gladiators at 7:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p>	32432
32632	A look into new and returning sports in the 2020 Summer Olympics	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every four years, nations from around the world come together to compete in various sports at the 126-years-old Summer Olympics. Through all this time, the only thing that has seemed to change is the location of the competition, but this year there are major differences.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sports such as gymnastics, track and swimming typically steal the show at the Summer Olympics, but this year's 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo will spice things up. In 2016, the </span><a href="https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-approves-five-new-sports-for-olympic-games-tokyo-2020" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">International Olympic Committee</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> (IOC) decided to add five new sports to the program in order to "put even more focus on innovation, flexibility and youth in the development Olympic program."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32631"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Without further ado, here are the new sports that will be joining the upcoming Olympics:</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Baseball and softball</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Last played in the Beijing 2008 Olympics, baseball and softball have had a complicated history. Baseball and softball became medal events in the Barcelona 1992 Olympics and Atlanta 1996 Olympics, respectively. In 2005, however, the IOC voted to remove the two sports beginning the London 2012 Olympics. Olympic fans have speculated that the reason could be that the IOC was unable to reach a consensus with Major League Baseball, since their players are the world's best on the field. But this year, men's baseball and women's softball will be returning to the stage. Since baseball is not too popular around the world, only six nations will be qualifying. So far, four </span><a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191115010500315" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">teams</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, including host nation Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Israel, are slated to compete.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Karate</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since Japan is the host nation, it is only logical to introduce a sport of Japanese origin. Karate will debut with two different categories: Kata and Kumite. </span><a href="https://www.thekaratelifestyle.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-kata-in-karate/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Kata</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is an individual demonstration of martial arts movements that showcases different important skills necessary for the arts. </span><a href="http://www.physicalarts.com/en/knowledge/kumite-and-sparring/what-is-kumite" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Kumite</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is a sparring match between two individuals. Each competitor receives points for landing their hand or arm in an opponent's target area while keeping correct Karate form. The first person to get eight points or the person who obtains the most points by the end of the match is the winner.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Skateboarding</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Wait, skateboarding is a sport? Well according to the </span><a href="https://tokyo2020.org/en/games/sport/olympic/skateboarding/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">IOC</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, it is. For the Olympics, there will be two events. One is a street event: individuals skate with stairs, rails and ramps. Their feats are rated on different aspects such as originality, speed, height, etc. The other event is the park event, taking place on a bowl-shaped course. The skaters are also judged based on the originality and difficulty of their feats.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sport climbing</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Now climbing? Yep. Athletes will compete in three disciplines: speed, bouldering and lead climbing. Speed climbing...the name says it all. Two climbers race to reach the top of a 15-meter wall with a safety rope. In bouldering, the climbers try to ascend a smaller 4-meter high wall without a rope. For lead climbing, the athletes, with a safety rope attached, attempt to climb as high as possible on a 15-meter high wall within six minutes.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Surfing</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Surfing will take place on Shidashita Beach in Chiba.

32771	The College Board decided to administer online exams amid school closures	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now recommending an eight to 20 week quarantine to contain the spread of the coronavirus, school closures and spring activities are up in the air. On March 20, The College Board announced that </span><a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/coronavirus-updates" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">traditional in-person Advanced Placement (AP) exam administration will not take place</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. Instead, students can opt to take a 45-minute online exam at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Department of Education has cancelled a multitude of standardized tests, as officials recognize that this is not a priority. However, 91 percent of 18,000 AP students surveyed by the College Board wanted to retain the opportunity to earn credit. Thus, the administration will be working with educators to develop online exams that will be given on two separate dates that are still to-be-determined. Students who have the coursework fresh in their memory can take the test on the first date in May, and those who want to practice can take the test on the second date.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Furthermore, the College Board will be providing free remote learning </span><a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/coronavirus-updates#free-ap-classes" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">resources</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. The exams will only test material learned by early March, in an attempt to account for students who have lost more instruction. A table with the units that each AP exam will cover can be found </span><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/coronavirus-update" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. Colleges are allowing students to receive credit for these tests. Alternatively, if students do not want to take the exams due to any circumstances, there will be no cancellation charge.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The two big issues College Board is currently addressing are test security and connectivity.&nbsp;Students who need mobile tools and/or connectivity can reach out to College Board. The streamlined exams will be designed to fit any device and photograph submissions of handwritten work will also be allowed. To keep tests secure, a variety of digital security tools and techniques will be used, in addition to plagiarism detection software.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Vice President of AP and Instruction, Trevor Packer, tweeted more details. “The at-home AP Exams this year will not include any multiple-choice questions, only free-response questions adapted for secure testing at home. They will measure skills that can’t be learned from Google or chats with friends,” he wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additional details can be located on the College Board </span><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/coronavirus-update" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">website</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. The full exam schedule, specific free-response question types that will appear on each exam, and additional testing information will be provided by April 3.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Update (3/7/20): On April 3, the College Board released the new exam dates and course-specific exam formats, which can be viewed </span><a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/about-ap/news-changes/coronavirus-update" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. Official testing dates are May 11 through May 22, and June 1 through June 5 will serve as make-up dates. The exams will be open book/open note, but students may not consult with one another. The College Board will cancel the AP scores of anyone who violates exam security, in addition to notifying their high school and/or future colleges. </span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(55, 55, 55);">This is a fluid story and updates will be added when available.</em></p>	32197

Without giving up the element of surprise, the chance that you'll choose the perfect gift are outrageously slim. Even if you've pinpointed the perfect gift for a best friend, they might prefer one color over the other—and who would know but them?</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32466"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It's custom that we give gifts to others during the holiday season. In fact, gift-giving, whether in the form of modern-day presents or historical tribute, has always been a part of human civilization. It's unrealistic to hope for a world devoid of incessant gifting, but what if we could do it again? The tradition of gifting is hardly the right move.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gift-giving seems generous and altruistic at first glance—it's the perfect way to express appreciation for a loved one. However, the devil lies in the details. This picture-perfect portrayal of gifting glosses over the associated stress and economic deadweight.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To combat the awkwardness accompanying guessing gifts for mere acquaintances, Secret Santas have seen a surge in wish lists in recent years. However, this development creates problems of its own: either the wish list becomes so specific that the recipient knows exactly which item to expect, or there's too much wiggle room.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To put it another way, money is always best spent by the gift recipients themselves. Given a $20 bill, a person will spend it on exactly what they want most, thus generating the maximum happiness value for that specific person. On the other hand, anything else is always a less productive use of the money.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In a study from the </span><a href="https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/104699/original/christmas.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>American Economic Review</em></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, the Deadweight Loss of Christmas, Joel Waldfogel discovered that "between a tenth and a third of the value of holiday gifts is destroyed in gift giving." According to </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/average-cost-of-an-american-christmas.aspx" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Investopedia</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, each person spent an average of $885 on holiday gifts in 2018, meaning each person lost an average of up to $295 on the "money spent vs. happiness attained" spectrum by applying Waldfogel's findings. Over $1 trillion were spent nationwide, amounting to up to 300 billion dollars lost.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Waldfogel's study found that recipients would pay far less for their gifts than the amount gifters spent. Overspending is motivated by the idea that more money spent shows a greater amount of appreciation, which isn't inherently wrong as the gifter sacrifices more. However, the sentiment doesn't make it to the other end, where recipients instead evaluate based on utility and pleasure.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Money is going down the drain by the trillions, but gifting doesn't only cause economic detriment. Between Thanksgiving and New Year’s Day, the amount of trash produced in the U.S. increases by </span><a href="https://www.neefusa.org/holiday-waste" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">25 percent</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, or one million extra tons of garbage each week. When the $11 billion worth of packing material&nbsp;is discarded annually, it undergoes bacterial decomposition and release greenhouse gases such as methane, carbon dioxide and water vapor. Unwanted gifts and products that aren't made to last land in the dump, too, as excess debris from the festivity.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The negative effects stack the odds against gifting, but the practice is second-nature— it's not going anywhere. While it may be impossible to completely denounce this custom without some potential recipients taking offense, consider buying a gift only when you know it'll make their day, not because you're forced to. Even better, gift experiences rather than objects. After all, memories last longer than a box of chocolates.</span></p>	32466
33264	The social media app for runners and cyclists has grown in popularity during the pandemic, but will it benefit your workouts?	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If you're looking to get into running or biking this year, you might consider downloading </span><a href="https://www.strava.com/features" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Strava</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, an app for runners and cyclists that blends elements of training platforms like </span><a href="https://www.nike.com/nrc-app" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Nike Run Club</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> with social media.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Strava allows you to track your run or bike ride using GPS and then share it with your followers. Athletes of all levels use Strava, including professional runners and cyclists. Its financial model is different from other major social media platforms because it does not sell your personal data to advertisers; it instead relies on a "freemium" model, where certain features on the app are locked behind a monthly paywall.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However the app is fully functional without the premium subscription. The free version of Strava allows users to track their workouts and gives them data on their distance, speed, and elevation. One of the most popular features is Strava Segments, which allows users to compete with one another for the fastest run/bike time on a certain stretch of road and trail. Some people also enjoy completing Strava's various challenges that can unlock discounts for fitness companies.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The premium version of Strava, Strava Summit, offers additional features including the ability to set custom weekly and yearly workout goals, training plans, more in-depth analysis of your workouts (for all you data nerds), and planning custom routes for your ride/run.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If you do decide to download Strava, Marijke Friedman, a junior on Blair's cross country and track teams, has some advice. She stresses the importance of appreciating the small victories of training. "Every little bit counts. If you go a little bit further than you did the day before or a little bit faster than you did the day before, that's awesome," Friedman says. She frequently uploads her runs to Strava but has learned to stop comparing her training to her teammates and competitors. Since Strava allows her to go back and look at all of her runs and paces, she can measure her personal improvement through data.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33263"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Training can get lonely, especially during a pandemic, so Strava has grown in popularity this past year because it allows users to interact and compete virtually. Lars Bjork, a junior who runs track and cross country at Blair, likes that he can share his runs and comment on them for his followers. "I think that it can give you the opportunity to express a lot more about what you're doing [in training]," Bjork says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Strava encourages competition among its users, which is a double-edged sword. While competition encourages dedication to one's sport, it can also lead athletes to push themselves harder than they should, leading to injury, burnout, or simply falling out of love with their sport. Strava, while encouraging competition, can stir up feelings of insecurity and make users feel as if they are living vicariously through other athletes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For Yohannes Legesse, a senior who is also on Blair's track and cross country teams, Strava provides him an opportunity to share the highs and lows of training with teammates and competitors. "I know sometimes I have a bad workout and then when I upload the activity, I'll just like rant on [Strava]. There's usually someone who comes by and says, 'Dude, it's alright,' and I think that part is key. Even if these are people you're competing with, they usually support you if you're going through a rough time," Legesse says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the competition on Strava motivates Legesse, it can be stressful for Bjork. "I think it [Strava] is too competitive… If I see someone else's run and they have a faster average pace than me, I'm gonna want to be like them… That throws me off a little bit," Bjork says. Running is a sport that values consistency above all else, and trying to run at a pace that is too fast for one's current fitness level is a recipe for derailing their training.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If you already feel overwhelmed with your social media usage, it might be wise to track your runs and bike rides using a GPS tracking device or a stopwatch. If using Strava makes you feel like working out is a performance rather than something you enjoy, it might be wise to stay off the app as well. If you're looking for an app to hold you accountable to your training, track your progress through data, and connect you with other athletes in your community, then Strava is for you.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33263

33249	The MCPS parent survey indicates that most students will remain in virtual learning in the second semester	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Dec. 15, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) released the results of their hybrid learning survey which were shared with students via social media. Out of the 165,724 families surveyed, 50.2 percent (63,760) responses indicated that they wanted their children to remain in virtual only learning, and 49.8 percent (63,352) of responses indicated that they wanted their children to participate in partial in-person learning or a hybrid method. All of these responses are dependent on cases lowering to a test positivity rate of less than 5 percent over a 14 day period.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33250"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Kasey Thorpe was surprised by the results of the survey. Thorpe believed parents would like the break from their children being home all day. “I feel like more parents would want to send their kids [back to school]. I think either a lot of parents want their kids out of the house or they would want them to be in a more structured environment,” Thorpe said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although she was surprised by the results of the survey, she understands the reasoning behind many parent’s choices. “Going back to school would cause a bigger risk for an outbreak within the school itself,” Thorpe explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Lauren Berley agreed that returning to school may not be the best choice. “</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">I'm honestly kind of glad that most people won't be returning because the numbers are still so high. I know that my family has taken a more conservative approach to this whole situation,” Berley said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This MCPS learning survey asked parents whether they would prefer to keep their students in virtual learning, or whether they would allow their students to participate in a hybrid model of virtual learning and in-person learning in the second semester. Both options would still allow students to participate in virtual athletics and extracurricular activities. The survey also asked families if their children would need MCPS provided transportation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The 38,513 families who did not respond to the survey were automatically placed in virtual only learning.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS did not provide additional details regarding the racial, ethnic, age or religious breakdown regarding the survey results. The survey opened fronom Nov. 11 and was initially supposed to close on Dec. 3; however, MCPS extended the deadline to Dec. 7. During this additional four day period, MCPS received 20,000 more responses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Families who chose a blend of in-person learning and virtual learning will be able to opt-out and switch to virtual only learning if they change their minds; however, families that chose to keep their students in virtual learning cannot switch to in-person learning. Thorpe believes parents should be able to change their minds and switch their children from virtual to in-person learning. Thorpe understands that the severity of COVID-19 may change; therefore, pushing parents to change their decision. “I feel like with the unpredictability of how leadership is acting towards the virus, going back may be a good choice now but as we move forward that assumption might change due to the severity of the situation,” Thorpe said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition Berley explained that parents' level of comfort surrounding this issue could change based on a variety of factors. “</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">MCPS should allow parents to change their minds because comfort levels change all the time. I'm sure that many people will decide that they don't want their kids to go back, so these people can take their spots,” Berley said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The school district finalized its </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/publicinfo/community/school-year-2020-2021/community-update-20210112.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">plan</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to reopen on Jan. 12. MCPS has pushed reopening until Mar. 15. On Feb. 23 the board will meet again to finalize the plan.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If proper metrics are met, students who chose to return to school will begin returning in phases starting Mar. 15, 2021. So far these metrics have not been met. Cases in Montgomery County continue to rise. As of Jan. 12, Montgomery County has a test positivity rate of 6.6 percent.&nbsp;</span></p>	33248
31648	Bessie Smith, the Empress of Blues	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31647"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">February is in full swing, and SCO is examining the lives of influential African-Americans throughout the decades starting with the 20s and 30s. The person chosen for this decade is Bessie Smith. Her career started with singing in bars and theatres all across the South. In 1920, she moved to Philadelphia, where she was heard by Clarence Williams, a representative for Columbia Records. She was signed by the label in 1923. Dubbed the Empress of Blues, Smith's strong vocal performances wowed audiences across the country.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">She was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1984 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. The combination of wide range and Smith's singing voice changed the landscape of blues music and pioneered what would become rap music. The sometimes emotional delivery and lyrics about personal struggles of rap today was largely shaped by Smith. Smith won many awards in her lifetime and won even more after her death. The genre-crossing prowess of Smith broke barriers and influenced artists for years to come.</span></p>	31647
32900	Students will be in schools in February 2021 at the earliest	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Tuesday, July 21, MCPS announced that the first semester of the 2020-2021 school year would take place entirely online and that all winter and fall sports programs were canceled in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The announcement also included a statement that considerations for an in-person second semester would be made on Nov. 10</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In a </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/publicinfo/community/school-year-2020-2021/community-update-20200721.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">letter </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">released to Parents, Guardians, Students and Staff, MCPS Superintendent Jack Smith emphasized that schools would continue online for the school year until further instruction was provided by the state. “The safest choice for our district is to remain in a virtual-only instructional model through the first semester—January 29, 2021; or until state and local health officials determine conditions in our county allow for students to return safely after the first semester,” he wrote.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The superintendent continued that MCPS expects Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and State Superintendent Dr.Karen Salmon to release a statewide school recovery plan this week and has prepared to adjust parts of the decision. “We will review their guidance and make all necessary adjustments to align our plans,” he explained.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith explains that an updated plan will be presented to the Montgomery County Board of Education on Aug. 6 following feedback from health officials and the community. The Board will vote on the updated plan once it is presented.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For many students, services such as free meals were provided at school locations during the 2019-2020 school year closure. Smith expressed that MCPS is looking into maintaining such services during the 2020-2021 school year. “We are seeking the ability to allow buildings to remain open in a limited capacity for essential purposes, including meal service; to support access to technology and other materials, and for use by some child care providers.” he wrote.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Improving from the previous semester, Smith explains that MCPS is looking to use a more uniform system for online learning. “We are also streamlining digital tools and platforms to make it easier for our students, staff, and families,” he stated in the letter.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to developing a streamlined system, Smith writes that teachers and staff are being provided with additional training to adapt to the virtual learning environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is a fluid story and will be updated as more information becomes available.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32876
32463	The film is one of the worst productions to hit the big screen	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ever since the release of its controversial and rather disturbing trailer, “Cats”</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">has been one of the most long-awaited films to hit the box office. As it turns out, the trailer was spot on as to what to expect during the movie: uncomfortably naked human-cats, inconsistent CGI and a whole lot of misplaced cat mannerisms.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film opens when a new cat named Victoria (Francesca Hayward) gets plopped into the world of the “Jellicle” cats. In this world, a Jellicle ball is held once a year. There, each cat sings a song for a chance at a new life. Old Deutoronomy (Judi Dench) then chooses the “Jellicle choice” cat that will drift off into the Heaviside layer (heaven) to become reborn. Macavity (Idris Elba), one of the cats, tries to kidnap the other cats to secure his own spot into the Heaviside layer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The entire film is just an awkward mash-up of solo dances and songs performed by each of the Jellicle contestants. As Victoria is introduced to the members of the Jellicle clan, each cat gets a 10-minute solo introducing themselves and complaining about their circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The movie is based on the “Cats” </span><a href="https://www.catsthemusical.com/about-the-show/the-story-of-cats/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">musical</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, the longest running London and Broadway production. The “one song per cat” idea may play well in a musical, but it definitely does not translate smoothly onto the big screen. The whole movie feels like a big “wait for it” moment with no satisfying resolution.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32462"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Cats” just seems like an excuse for director Tom Hooper to put together 15 A-list singing celebrities and market it as “the biggest Christmas movie of the year.”Granted, the vocals were amazing. Rum Tum Tugger (Jason Derulo) and Bombalurina (Taylor Swift) performed amazing riffs and catchy title tracks. But even that was overshadowed by the weak plot, leaving viewers wondering when each song-dance combo would end.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the only noteworthy performances of the whole movie was Grizabella’s (Jennifer Hudson) solo about becoming a shunned Jellicle cat. The song was filled with heart-felt emotion, and it is the only song that shows the glimmer of talent that the audience expected throughout the entire movie.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, the movie&nbsp;uncomfortably replaces humans actions with cat mannerisms. Instead of hugging, for example, the human-faced, cat-bodied creatures rub on top of each other and purr unnecessarily loudly. Instead of kissing, the cats rub cheeks for an absurdly long time. The whole movie was just one step away from becoming a “not kid-friendly" movie.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In fact, uncomfortable seemed to be the name of the game. It’s evident that the director and producer actually tried to make a serious movie instead of a lighthearted comedy yet failed. The combination of cat movements and human characteristics produced an eerie sensation that made many squirm.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The elephant in the room, and perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the film, is the CGI.&nbsp;Because the shape of the human body is still displayed in each cat, they seem like naked people covered in fur. The whole approach to creating a hybrid of human and cat was wildly inappropriate, especially when Jennyanydots (Rebel Wilson) was spreading her legs for half the movie. It was quite nauseating.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Besides physical appearance, the CGI work was also very sloppy. In many scenes, the cats’ fingers and hands were very much human, and the producers did not even attempt to blend them into the cat bodies. In fact, in numerous scenes, Judi Dench still </span><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/12/23/cats-movie-judi-dench-human-hand-cat-body/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">has </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">her wedding ring on her finger. There were also scenes where the cats’ fur was questionably smooth, almost reminiscent of overusing the smoothing tool in Photoshop.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Cats” was everything we expected and worse. The addition of celebrities like James Corden and Taylor Swift sadly could not save the movie. If you want a film that will make you want to claw your eyes out, this is it. Otherwise, save the torture for another time.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Cats” is rated PG for some rude and suggestive humor and is playing at Regal Majestic &amp; IMAX and ArcLight Cinemas Bethesda.</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32462
31995	The U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team has done more than win the World Cup	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On August 1, General Mills released a limited-edition Wheaties box featuring the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team (USWNT). Receiving this honor, which has traditionally been given to world-class athletes since the 1950s, shows that the team is leaving a considerable mark in a country that does not have a large soccer fanbase. They are not only leaving a strong impression in the sports world, but are doing what few athletes have done: impacting the lives of people all across the country and the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In early July, the USWNT won the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup in France. They beat the Netherlands 2-0 in the final match, claiming their fourth World Cup win.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31994"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The USWNT pulled off the unimaginable: they brought good soccer to the U.S. They built a huge fanbase in a country where the men’s team didn’t even qualify for the World Cup. Fox News' viewership </span><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/presspass/latest-news/2019/07/08/u-s-victory-delivers-14271000-fox-sports-viewers-fifa-womens-world-cup-france-2019-final" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">peaked at nearly 20 million across their coverage of the final match</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. Following the team's victory, thousands of fans attended the celebratory parade in</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> New York City.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only did the USWNT build a loyal audience this World Cup, but they also used their popularity to shed light on important issues such as the pay gap between male and female soccer players. While this has been a popular subject for quite some time, this summer’s World Cup gave the team the perfect opportunity to bring the issue to the forefront.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The team filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation in March. The lawsuit pointed out that the women would be paid 62 percent of the men's earnings in their 20-game schedule outside of the tournament. They also faced large disparities in bonuses earned during the tournament.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The USWNT members are playing smart both on and off the field—well aware of the spotlight placed upon them this summer, they used their stage to talk about this issue and garner support for their fight for equality.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Megan Rapinoe, co-captain of the USWNT, is one of the biggest names from this year’s tournament. She has been the leader of women’s soccer’s movement for equal pay and is becoming a prominent social activist. </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/megan-rapinoe-new-muhammad-ali/592867/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">The Atlantic</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> stated that “Megan Rapinoe is her generation’s Muhammad Ali” because of the way that she has combined sports and activism.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rapinoe made a splash prior to the World Cup when she announced that she would not participate in singing the national anthem. She later explained that </span><a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/megan-rapinoe-why-i-am-kneeling" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">the gesture was in an effort to show her support for those fighting for racial inequality</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rapinoe made headlines again for harshly refusing the idea of visiting the president. “I’m not going to the f---ing White House if we win,” she said.

32501	The Blazers continue their winning streak and beat the Gladiators 70-35	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (4-0) defeated the Northwood Gladiators (1-3) 70-35 on Friday night. Northwood put on a tough show from a defense standpoint, but Blair’s superior passes and shots ultimately secured their win.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The game started with junior captain and guard-forward Peyton Martin winning the tip-off. Blair quickly achieved a four-point lead with a freethrow from freshman guard Amelia Martin and a three-pointer from junior guard Kate Hildebrandt. Northwood countered with a two-pointer. The ball continued to exchange hands throughout the quarter as shots were made by both teams. Stress levels were high as Northwood began to close Blair’s lead. The Blazers appeared visibly distressed as they missed some shots and made a few rough plays. Blazer defense continuously grabbed rebounds, but Northwood's persistent offense caused the Blazers to foul. Blair ended the first quarter with a narrow lead of 16-10.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Amelia Martin reflected on the team's subpar defense, which allowed the Gladiators to counter the Blazers' baskets.&nbsp;“We need to rotate the ball on offense, communicate on defense and help on defense; we lost so many points because they kept dishing the ball to the same [Northwood player] on the opposite block.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the second quarter, the Blazers had newfound energy and determination as they widened the score gap. Northwood continued to make baskets, but Blair stifled their opponents' success by tightening up passes and making cleaner shots. Increased communication led to better quality plays and ended the first half 36-18.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With the help of her teammates, freshman guard Natalie Frost opened the third quarter by swiftly scoring five points. Through successful communication, the Blazers continued to catch rebounds and direct the ball to their side of the court. Fourth quarter highlighted some of the issues with both Northwood’s offense and defense. On defense, Northwood tried to set several picks, but they were ineffective as Blair dribblers passed to a teammate they kept nearby. On offense, Northwood made several shots from either side of the basket, but had no one rebounding on the other side when the shot was too long. The night ended with a 70-35 victory for Blair.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32500"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Frost agreed that Blair's victory was a direct result of the change in Blazer morale during the second quarter. “I think we struggled a little bit in the first quarter, but then from the second quarter to the fourth quarter we picked it up...First quarter we were rushing things, like we were kind of nervous. Then, second quarter, we were able to slow it down and actually run through our plays and get the ball to the open person to score,” Frost said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday, January 10th against the Bethesda-Chevy Chase Barons at 7:15 p.m. </em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32500
32231	Many Blair students are unaware of the people dealing with the school's technological issues	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the 21st century, technology plays a major role in education and benefits students and teachers alike. From Promethean Boards and Chromebooks to myMCPS Classroom, Montgomery County's education system has gradually become more reliant on technology. However, there are often issues such as WiFi disconnections and malfunctioning Chromebooks in a large school like Blair, where hundreds and sometimes thousands of students use Chromebooks at any given time. This is where information technology (IT) specialists come in.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32230"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Peter Hammond, Blair's Information Technology Systems Services (ITSS), has been at Blair for 25 years, yet many students have never met him. He works in the back room of the media center, where he deals with Blair's multitude of technological problems. He also runs Blair's websites alongside the System Operators (Sysops), a small application-based group of students interested in technology and computer programming.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hammond works primarily with computer and software system malfunctions. "Anything that is computer-related has a decent chance of being something I deal with," he said. "There are a few exceptions here and there, but if something breaks or if something needs adjustment or there's something new, then I have something to do with fixing it or explaining it or adjusting it," he adds.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair is especially prone to such malfunctions, Hammond says, due to its large student body size and application programs. Blair has over 3,000 Chromebooks, at least 700 desktop computers and laptops and about 3,500 Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) accounts between students and staff. Additionally, its Math, Science and Computer Science Magnet and Communication Arts Program often have technological issues of their own.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although the county is in charge of coming up with a central software template for all schools to use, this often has to be tweaked to fit Blair individually, which is another aspect of Hammond's job. This is for the most part because of its application programs that use their own extra software. Hammond's favorite parts of his job are figuring out problems and having the opportunity to help others. "[Problems] are something that's puzzle-like that I get to solve, and also, whenever you're doing something that's helping people out, that's good too," he said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hammond is also the supervisor of the Sysops. They maintain and repair Blair's two servers, which run most of the school's websites, such as </span><a href="https://mbhs.edu/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">mbhs.edu</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, club pages and Silver Chips Online.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/behind-the-screen-28135/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">the Sysops' role has changed</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> since the group originated two decades ago, they are still crucial to Blair's IT system. "In 1995, you could let a student have a lot more access than they have now, because grades and everything else are on the system, but they still help run our websites and deal with repair issues," Hammond said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Evan Guenterberg, who joined the Sysops over a year ago, enjoys the opportunity to solve problems with his friends. "Whenever there's an issue, we all get together to work on it," he said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition to website and software maintenance and repair, the Sysops take part in their own side projects, some more necessary than others. Some are just fun, silly projects, and others have serious benefits for the entire school. One project that they are currently working on is cleaning out their tech room, which contains old Sysops equipment that hasn't been looked through in awhile, including lots of computers, according to Guenterberg.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A subgroup of the Sysops, the Webmasters, is in charge of maintaining, updating and occasionally redesigning Blair's home page. This website revision takes place every few years when there are enough interested students. Hammond hopes it will happen sooner rather than later because the site is starting to look "a little shabby."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It's important to understand the value of the work Hammond and the Sysops do for Blair. Even if it isn't always easily seen, they play an essential role in keeping Blair's web systems and software as modern as possible in order to ensure that students receive a quality 21st-century education.</span></p>	32230
32227	The Blazers defeated the Panthers 8-0 to advance to the regional final	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair Blazers (11-4) defeated the Paint Branch Panthers (4-10) with a score of 8-0 in their first playoff game on Friday. Blair got off to a slow start, but senior captain Janie Pitner and junior Seren Sarkozy-Banocsy soon each scored a goal for the Blazers. The team had lots of offensive opportunities, but some of their passes didn't connect, preventing them from truly dominating. However, Pitner, assisted by sophomore Marlee Ginyard, and senior captain Noa Dorah, assisted by senior Dede Greenfield, were each able to score and give Blair a 4-0 lead at the half.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32226"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The second half was much more physical than the first. A Paint Branch forward slammed junior Indigo Suchar, who played solid defense throughout the entire game, to the ground. Suchar thought the referees made some bad calls. "The reffing was a little sketchy, there were definitely some calls that were incorrect," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pitner and Dorah both had to come out of the game for a few minutes after being aggressively fouled by the Panthers. Despite the physicality she faced, Dorah scored two more goals to get a hat trick. In addition, Sarkozy-Banocsy scored another goal and Ginyard scored off an assist from junior Emilie Vigliotta.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair ended up taking an 8-0 victory, despite having five players who were unable to play due to injuries. Suchar hopes that more of them will play in the next game. "It's a little worrying that we have so many injuries, so hopefully that doesn't continue," she said. The Blazers will advance to play Sherwood in the regional final next week.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game against the Sherwood Warriors on Tuesday, Oct. 29 at 5:15 pm.</em></p>	32226

As the </span><a href="https://www.icsc.com/news-and-views/icsc-exchange/black-friday-still-busiest-shopping-day-study-says" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">busiest shopping day</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of the year, Black Friday takes the throne for environmental cost.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Black Friday capitalizes on the "fear of missing out," or FOMO, by urging shoppers to act fast and catch the deals. However, in chasing the tip of the iceberg, they forget the emissions-intensive production, waste-abundant packaging and destructive delivery that bubbles beneath the surface— think plastic bags from Urban Outfitters, plastic product packaging for new hair clips, packing peanuts and more.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32346"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Online shoppers drastically drive up the number of trucks on the road and the number of stops each has to make, with transportation now the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">leading cause</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of greenhouse gas emissions. An analysis conducted by the </span><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/climate-lab" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Climate Lab</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> found that expedited shipping intensifies the environmental impact because distributors have less time to fill trucks fully and bundle packages, instead sending out an excess of half-empty trucks.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Beyond the environmental impact of production and distribution, disposable products have a brief lifespan. Once the item serves its seasonal trend, they have nowhere to go except the waste bin. "Half of this stuff [from Black Friday] is thrown away by Christmas," junior Maddie Graham says. "You don't need it."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The fast fashion industry reigns when it comes to disposability, characterized by dirt-cheap prices and endless consumption. It's not magic: these low price points are fueled by workers without rights and synthetic fibers that end up in our waste streams. Companies deliberately plan for quick trend changes throughout the season, leading to items that are only made to last for a few wears before falling apart. Thus, textile production generates </span><a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/assets/downloads/publications/A-New-Textiles-Economy_Full-Report.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">1.2 billion tons</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of carbon dioxide annually, and discarded clothing bumps the figure up to </span><a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/environmental-audit-committee/sustainability-of-the-fashion-industry/written/88396.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">3.3 billion tons</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">— roughly 8 percent of total global carbon emissions.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Katrina Warren decided to boycott fast fashion brands three years ago after discussing the factory working conditions with her family. "In reality, the reason they're so cheap is because girls are working in sweatshops in other parts of the world for barely any money," Warren says. "Yes, style is important to me, but not at that cost."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Boycotting Black Friday doesn't force fashion fanatics to kick style to the curb. Instead of items from Forever 21 and H&amp;M, Graham and Warren invest in pre-loved pieces and unique finds at thrift shops. Graham mentions that thrifting easily infinitely increases the lifetime of clothing items through a continuous cycle of buying and donating. When she no longer wants a piece of clothing, she donates it back to the thrift shop and picks out something new.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Graham also nods to sustainable brands such as Reformation and Alternative Apparel but acknowledges that they're not economically accessible to everyone. "There are sustainable clothing shops but they're really expensive," she says. "However, thrifting is really accessible and you find some cool stuff while helping out the environment."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Warren makes clothes out of thrift finds using a sewing machine. "Either I'll go to the thrift store and find a really cool fabric to make a skirt or a dress, or I'll take a piece of clothing and tailor it to my taste or my size," she says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Graham, president of Blair Green Club and organizer for Fridays For Future USA (FFFUSA), is preparing for the next major global strike that conveniently falls on Black Friday. While the international organization chose the date by chance, striking on this national holiday symbolizes more for American climate activists. "We're striking in the US particularly against consumer culture, throwaway culture, fast fashion— industries that are literally killing the earth," she says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For Graham and other strikers, Black Friday is the height of regression from what they fight for each Friday. "It's a punch in the face to sustainability," Graham says. "All the industries that don't care about their environmental impact as long as they can continue to turn a profit— they're raking it in on Black Friday and people celebrate that."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">﻿Thankfully, corporate social responsibility is a growing trend among businesses, where environmental and social concerns are incorporated into a company's platform. In the past, Adidas has partnered with Parley for the Oceans and Stella McCartney to release recycled apparel, including </span><a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/parley" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">athletic shoes</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> made with upcycled marine plastic waste.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sustainable brands are also taking direct action against Black Friday.

According to Graham, consumers are the drivers of change in our capitalist world. She points to Forever 21, a former global retail superpower now filing for bankruptcy as consumers began to realize its toll on the environment. "I really do think people vote with their wallets," Graham says. "If there is enough outreach from consumers, fast fashion will shift their ways."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"It's sink or swim," Graham says. "Either change or be left behind."</span></p>	32346
32673	The Wildcats beat the Blazers by a score of 48-45	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (11-4) lost to the Walter Johnson Wildcats (8-7) by a score of 48-45 on Wednesday night. Throughout the game, the Blazers struggled to counter Walter Johnson’s shots, missing many scoring opportunities and making only 17 out of 60 shots.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Within the first few minutes of the game, Blair had a narrow lead of 9-5. However, after bad passes that led to turnovers, a couple fouls and five missed scoring opportunities, Blair began to falter. From this point onwards, Walter Johnson started their scoring rampage, scoring 14 unanswered points. Shots by freshman guard Natalie Frost, junior guard Kate Hildebrandt and senior guard-forward Lucy Martin raised Blair’s score, but missed baskets left Blair unable to close the score gap and kept Walter Johnson in the lead. The Blazers were trailing 29-18 at halftime.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Third quarter marked Blair’s comeback, with senior guard Zoe Abramson and freshman guard Amelia Martin leading powerful defense, which limited Walter Johnson’s baskets. The Blazers subsequently scored 16 points with their newfound aggression. “With us obviously being down at the beginning, I think it made us play with a lot of urgency to get back in, and I think you saw that in the third quarter. We then came out with a lot of energy and took the lead”, Abramson said. Blair was ahead 38-35 with 2:16 left in the quarter. By the end of the quarter, the score was tied 38-38.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The fourth quarter was tense as Blair pushed to secure a victory. Shots were made by both teams as they each attempted to pull ahead. Additionally, there were numerous fouls that led to free throws on both sides. With 50.5 seconds left in the game, the score was once again tied at 45-45. The crowd cheered loudly for the Blazers as they hoped for a home court win. Unfortunately, two fouls by Blair led to free throws that pulled Walter Johnson up to a total of 48 with 10 seconds left. At this point, the Blazers knew they needed a three-pointer to win. Two missed attempts ultimately led to Blair’s 48-45 loss.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Abramson noted that the team needs work towards playing with the same determination throughout the entire game. “ I think that maybe we got a little comfortable when we were up at certain points. Like right at the beginning of the game, we kind of let them take over, and once we got up, they came up again. We need to keep playing with the same amount of energy as if we were down,” she said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Tuesday, February 11th against the Winston Churchill Bulldogs at 7:15 p.m.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32672

32229	The Blazers won 5-0 to advance to the state bracket	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair Blazers (12-4) triumphed over the Sherwood Warriors (7-7) 5-0 in the regional championship on Tuesday. The Blazers put their best foot forward with a goal from junior Sophia Kim assisted by senior Dede Greenfield about ten minutes into the game. Shortly afterwards, senior captain Noa Dorah put one into the back of the net.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32228"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair continued to play as a unit for the remainder of the half, taking seven shots on goal and limiting Sherwood to only two. They took many offensive opportunities, and the defense placed a lot of pressure on the Warriors' forwards and mids. They finished the first half with a 2-0 lead.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sherwood came out much faster and more aggressive in the second half, but couldn't keep up with Blair. Kim scored another goal off a corner kick by senior captain Janie Pitner, and less than a minute later, Dorah scored again with an assist from Pitner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Warriors tried to make a comeback, but struggled to get through the Blair defense. Blair junior defender Indigo Suchar used her speed to prevent anyone from getting by her. Kim found the back of the net one more time to get her first hat trick of the season. "I'm just over the moon," Kim said. "I didn't think that I'd be able to score a hat trick this season, and in the regional final, I'm just so happy."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers came out with a 5-0 victory and the 4A North Region II title. Along with the other seven Maryland 4A regional champions, they will be reseeded into a new bracket to play for the state title. Kim has high hopes for Blair to make it far this postseason. "It's time to buckle down and get a deep run into the playoffs," she said.</span></p>	32228

This win brings the team to an undefeated record of 7-0 and ranks them first place in the county. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In high school wrestling, each team has wrestlers in 14 different weight classes that face off against wrestlers in their same weight class to earn their team points. The team with the highest amount of points at the end wins. Each team gets six points for every individual win by pin, four points for an individual win by seven or more, and three points for every individual win by less than seven. There are three 2-minute rounds unless there is a pin earlier. On Wednesday, most of Blair's wrestlers won their rounds by pinning their respective opponents.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sophomore Brian Mccaw (106) was the first wrestler for Blair and quickly pinned his opponent with 30 seconds left in the first period. “I felt great out there and knew I could get a pin against a team like Wheaton,” Mccaw said after his match. This win gave the Blazers an early 6-0 lead that they never gave up. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Next up was senior Mohammed Baig (113), followed by junior Moses Ritti (120). Both fell behind early in their matches but fought back and pinned their opponents. The Blazers showed great determination and held a commanding 18-0 lead after the first three wrestlers. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31565"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following Bitti was freshman Nikolai Tochillin (126), who nearly got pinned in the first period, but fought off being cradled by his opponent. Unfortunately, in the second period, he was defeated, getting pinned. This loss by Tochillin was only one of three by the Blazers all game, making the score 18-6. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair won the next 3 matches due to pins by senior Beruk Tona (132), freshman Junior Kim (138), and Junior Jason Kaplan (145). Tona quickly pinned his opponent in under a minute, while Kim’s pin wasn’t until late in the third period, each earning the team six points. Kaplan pulled his opponent down to the mat relatively early. “My takedown early in the match really helped me feel in control the rest of the way,” Kaplan said. These three wins widened the Blazers' lead to 36-6. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Steven Vilmenay (152) fought hard to keep the score even through two periods, until a technical foul in the third period was called on him for arguing with the referee. That foul gave the Wheaton Knights a team point and the momentum they need to win the round, bringing the score into double digits, 36-10.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Shalom Ayvivi (160) and senior captain Ernest Son (170). Both easily defeated their opponents, pinning them in the second period. A win by the captain, Son, was a great morale boost for a team. Blair's lead after Son’s win was now significantly wider, with the score being 48-10. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Brandon Ntankeu (182) was one of the few match wins not by pin for Blair. He capitalized on an early lead in the first round and never gave it up. Ntankeu ended up winning by eight points, a major, which awarded the Blazers four more points, making the score 52-10. The match was all but over with only three wrestlers left.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Next up was Junior captain Elias Chen (195), who pinned his opponent on the mat after only a minute of wrestling. Senior Joel Paulino (220) followed Chen, but fell behind early and was never able to recover. That round was Wheaton’s third and final win of the meet, bringing the score to 58-13. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Last but not least was junior captain Mervin Mancia (285), who capped off the meet with a compelling win, pinning his opponent in under thirty seconds. This finalized the score to 64-13.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers finished strong in a big win against the Wheaton Knights. The team hopes to carry this momentum into their next match this Friday, January 4th, at 6:15 PM against the powerful Clarksburg Coyotes.</span></p>	31565
32072	Asian-American Blazers celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lion dances, dragons and elaborate costumes fill the streets across East and Southeast Asia to the delight of spectators. At night, students stroll under hanging festival lanterns and stop at glowing shops selling traditional food like mooncakes, rice cakes and dumplings. They look forward to celebrating the holiday with family and friends for the next few days.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Friday, Sept. 13, Blazers of East and Southeast Asian descent celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival, an annual harvest celebration that falls on the 15th day of the 8th month in the lunar calendar. Though located halfway across the world from the excitement and mass celebration, the Blazers keep their cultures alive as they call relatives, organize parties and eat traditional food.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32071"></div><p><a href="https://www.chinatravel.com/focus/mid-autumn-festival/history/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">The Mid-Autumn Festival originated</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> from China's Zhou Dynasty (1045 – 221 BC), when emperors would worship the harvest moon in belief that it would bring them a plentiful harvest the following year. This concept of honoring the moon eventually spread to common citizens during the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907) and became a festival during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). Influenced by the Chinese, neighboring countries in East and Southeastern Asia began celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival, with distinct customs and beliefs developing in each country.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">China</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chinese Blazers were quick to affectionately call the festival by its nickname, "Mooncake Day," and for good reason: eating mooncakes is the most prominent custom associated with the Mid-Autumn Festival. Mooncakes are round pastries with a filling that comes in a variety of flavors, including red bean, lotus and other nuts or beans. Sophomore Angela Tu, whose family comes from Hong Kong, describes some of the nontraditional mooncakes that have gained popularity, "The snow-skin cakes have a mochi exterior and an ice cream filling. You can also have chocolate fillings… once we had lychee and durian in the middle," Tu says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For junior Ivy Liang, the shape of the pastries not only represents the full moon, but also the union between family members. "The mooncake is round, which represents fullness in the family, which basically means family together and growing together," she says.&nbsp;Liang adds that the festival is a day where everyone in her family gets together and reflects on the events of the year. She spent her night eating a home-cooked meal consisting of traditional Chinese side dishes. "[The food was] stuff I used to eat growing up, a kind of nostalgic food," Liang says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Like Liang, most Blazers enjoyed a traditional meal with their families and friends. Tu's family enjoyed plenty of seafood before going outside to look at the moon. "We'll normally bring some lanterns with us," she says. "We just sit together in a circle and chat."</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Japan</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As opposed to eating mooncakes, the Japanese celebrate their festivals with tsukimi-dango,&nbsp;spherical white dumplings that represent the full moon. "We have to get susuki, this pampas grass, and eat tsukimi-dango," says Blair Japanese teacher Yoko Zoll. </span><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/features/jg00115/tsukimi-the-japanese-tradition-of-autumn-moon-viewing.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Tsukimi-dango are traditionally put on display</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> either 12 at a time to represent the 12 months, or 15 at a time to represent the 15th day of the eighth month.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Vietnam</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Nick Bach celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival at his Vietnamese church, where he helps set up the annual event. "There's the fat dude in the pink mask… All the Vietnamese have some fat guy who runs around and flies the dragon," Bach explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The "fat guy" Bach refers to is Ong Dia, the Lord Earth, who is characterized by his round moon-face and represents prosperity and wealth. An important aspect of Vietnamese parades and festivals is the </span><a href="http://thingsasian.com/story/mid-autumn-childrens-festival" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">dragon dance</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, which represents the balance between the earth and the sky, or yin and yang. Ong Dia dances with the flying dragon to depict this balance.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After the dance,&nbsp;Bach and his church light up lanterns and walk around the church. "They [the lanterns] are all different; we have paper lanterns that are cylinders, and some people carry fish-shaped lanterns or round lanterns," he says.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">South Korea</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">South Korea's Mid-Autumn Festival, Chuseok, is also called Korean Thanksgiving. Similar to the United States' Thanksgiving, South Koreans return to their hometowns to eat a huge meal with their entire family. Though it is difficult to spend time with family when the majority of family is abroad, South Korean Blazers connected with their family members by giving them a call. "I ate songpyeon with my family and called my grandparents in Korea and wished them a good Chuseok," sophomore Sumin Choi said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Songpyeon is a traditional Korean rice cake with a sweet filling, usually made with a combination of honey, sesame seeds, beans, and pine nuts. The exterior is shaped like a halfmoon and can be stained with different fruits to create a variety of colors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though East and Southeast Asians living abroad practice many traditions for the Mid-Autumn Festival, senior June Lee voices a prevalent concern. "[Chuseok] doesn't have as much of an impact as it would if I were to live in Korea. If I were living in Korea, this would be a happy time for many students and families where you'd be having some time off," says Lee.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though Blazers miss the opportunity to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival surrounded by parades, sidewalks lined with food vendors, and decorations on every street corner, they aim to remind themselves of their family's culture and keep the tradition alive. "It's a day of celebration of being thankful… and appreciating history, culture and diffusion," junior Esther Tang says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">And regardless of the distinct traditions of each country and the different ways families&nbsp;celebrate, the Mid-Autumn Festival is a day for families around the world to gather and look up at the same full moon in giving thanks.&nbsp;</span></p>	32069
31731	A guide to class and club-sponsored activities	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">March marks Women's History Month, where we recognize influential women and their contributions to society. To celebrate, Blair's elective classes and clubs are hosting events and&nbsp;projects to commemorate important women in students' lives and around the world. Want to get involved? Here is SCO's guide to Women's History Month at Blair. </span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Buy a Girl Hero Gram</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair's Girl Up club is one of many national chapters working with the United Nations Foundation to empower women worldwide. From raising money for girls' education in Uganda and Malawi to spreading awareness about women's healthcare disparities, the club has a major activism presence at Blair. This month, they are selling Girl Hero Grams to help Blazers celebrate their peers. "They're basically like candy grams and they're for people at school to recognize their girl heroes," co-president Amy Krimm explained. "We'll be selling them the week of [March] 18." Stop by Girl Up's table in on Blair Boulevard to buy a Girl Hero Gram for a teacher or student who inspires you! </span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Check out Women's Studies' posters </strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Last year, Women's Studies students created several posters featuring famous women. This year, they are putting up the posters in the halls to help Blazers reflect on the role of women in areas like science and literature. This ties in with their current course material, which centers around "the evolving role of women in the U.S. from a legal and economic perspective," according to teacher Alison Russell. Women's Studies students also decorated the bulletin board outside the media center with a timeline that highlights women's achievements. Russell hopes the posters and showcase will give Blazers a new perspective on women's roles through history. "Hopefully, people can see women that they haven't studied their general history curriculums or in their math and science curriculums… It'll give them a chance to explore some things they've already learned in a different context," she said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31730"></div><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Read a book by a woman author</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From Michelle Obama's popular autobiography </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Becoming</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to Erika Sánchez's </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, the Blair media center offers countless books by female authors. Many of them explore intersections between feminism and issues like race, culture and class, making them both entertaining and educational. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From making strides in STEM fields to writing revolutionary books, women have played a crucial part in world history and society. March provides important opportunities to celebrate their achievements and advocate for further gender equality everywhere.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31730
32411	How Sandie Angulo Chen is helping Blair's library expand its outreach to students	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair's school library is a safe haven for those looking for a quiet space to study or relax. For the first few months of the school year, the media center was understaffed with only three faculty members. This limited Blair students from doing things such as checking out chromebooks because there simply weren't enough adults to supervise. However, there is a new library staff member, Sandie Angulo Chen, starting just this month who will be helping out in the media center.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Media center staff are hopeful that with another staff member, many tasks will be able to be accomplished. "There'll be two hours where [Angulo Chen] can really help us with organizing and getting ready and paying bills and doing all the kind of stuff we need to do so that we can open the door for you," Lamphier explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Angulo Chen is an active Blair parent and chose to apply for the media assistant job based on her experience reviewing young adult movies and books in publications like "Common Sense Media" and the KidsPost section in The Washington Post along with her involvement in nonprofit "We Need More Diverse Books". "The fact that I can work in a library, even though it is just part-time, is ideal for me because I'm so familiar with young adult literature and books that are aimed at students this age," Angulo Chen says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Before Angulo Chen arrived, some media center services weren't available, such as checking out chromebooks. "We have over 3000 students, so it's difficult to supervise and help the sheer number of students we have at the same time," Lamphier explains. Media center staff are ready to roll out chromebooks again, getting many students to sign chromebook contracts even before Angulo Chen started working. "We've already started giving students chromebook contracts and giving them their stickers to try to eliminate the long line at the very beginning," Lamphier says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When Raul Caldas transferred to another Montgomery County school this past year, he left a vacancy at Blair's media center. Remaining staff members juggled much of the work required to run the library. Having limited staff makes it difficult to complete these administrative tasks in addition to running the library on a daily basis. "Instead of being able to do what we would need to do to keep things moving so kids could see lots more new stuff coming out, we were just hanging in there by a thread," Media specialist Andrea Lamphier says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Student aides have helped media center staff balance both the managerial and over the desk work. "We have a lot of pretty dedicated student aides who helped first thing in the morning, which makes a real difference," Lamphier says. While student aides are valuable, the new library staff member will make the biggest contribution to running the media center.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32410"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Angulo Chen will be a welcome addition to Blair's media center, but even with her hiring, it still does not completely solve the Blair library's understaffing issue. Blair's media center has been understaffed for years. The Montgomery County Education Association and Board of Education of Montgomery County's school contract strongly suggests that there should be one media center specialist for every 500 students in a secondary school. However, Blair only has one media specialist for the whole school. Lamphier hopes that in the future, the Blair library will get more staff members. "I hope it will get better. I think Blair students and staff deserve better," Lamphier says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While the media center's workload will continue to build, the staff are hoping to do more student outreach this year. In the past year, Angulo Chen worked on Blair's first Teen Book Fair, in which different authors held workshops and book signings. "I have helped with the students that started a teen book fair and then I hope that this year they get even more authors that can come and talk to the students," Angulo Chen says. Angulo Chen plans to work at Blair's media center for a long time, viewing it as her ideal job. "I don't have any plans to go anywhere else. It's a perfect job because I can work here, and then also do my freelance writing when I get home," Angulo Chen says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The understaffing of Blair's media center is an issue, and while it will continue for the foreseeable future, with new staff member Angulo Chen hired, she hopes to bring her passion for literature to get more kids interested in books, along with the rest of the library staff. "There's a lot of great work out there that students this age could be reading, and authors that could be really meaningful to students," Angulo Chen says.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32410
33087	How ‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ has taken the world by storm	<p>In quarantine, there really isn’t much to do. Wake up, tend to your plants, eat some fruit, maybe rearrange your furniture, forge some paintings, or talk to your anthropomorphized Tanuki capitalist overlord, Tom Nook.</p><p>On March 20, Nintendo released <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, the widely-anticipated game in which players do all the aforementioned. The game is a quirky cross between the worldbuilding of <em>The Sims</em> and the community interaction of mayorship, requiring you to build friendships with human-like animals across the island town you manage.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33083"></div><p><em>New Horizons</em> does not have scintillating action and will not raise your heart rate. There are no levels, scores, or final bosses. Most days are spent doing tranquil activities like collecting bells—the currency of the game—checking in with your neighbors, and talking to the museum curator, an erudite owl named Blathers.</p><p>Some might consider <em>New Horizons</em> “a dumb, boring game for children,” like writer Jack Crosbie in his Business Insider article titled “It's time to admit 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons' is a dumb, boring game for children.” The most thrill you will probably get out of the game comes when running away from a swarm of wasps or playing a game of virtual musical chairs with friends. So what about <em>New Horizons </em>allowed it to sell over five million copies in March—breaking the record for most digital sales of a game sold in a month—when it had only been available for 11 days?</p><p>The answer lies in its unique release condition: quarantine. Currently, the Nintendo Switch—the video game console compatible with <em>New Horizons</em>—is in such high demand that it is selling for $200 above its sticker price on eBay. <em>New Horizons</em> presents the player with a bucolic getaway into a world with no deaths, negativity, or disagreements, laid over a chirpy soundtrack. There is always something to keep you occupied, be it picking weeds or catching fish. It helps fill the void of real-life interaction with a virtual stand-in, as you can hop on a plane and visit your friends and their islands without worrying about maintaining six feet of distance.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33084"></div><p>For junior Peter Nesin, quarantine has given him the opportunity to play much more <em>New Horizons</em> than he would have otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>“I [was] going to be in my second semester of junior year and I [was not] even going to be able to play it,” he said. “[The game] was not going to be something I really [would have gotten] to sink my teeth into because I have such a busy life, but then all of the stars aligned, and I was able to play this game for eight hours a day. I have 165 hours on the game.”</p><p>He has played the previous game in the franchise, <em>Animal Cros</em>si<em>ng: New Leaf</em>, but without the freedom of quarantine, his parents placed more restrictions on her gameplay at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>“I used to play it a lot, but I was only allowed to play it on weekends or holidays because my parents were worried about it distracting me,” he said. “And they were probably right about that because I've been so obsessed with [<em>New Horizons</em>].”</p><p>Another key element of the game is its multiplayer interaction, which quarantine has only enhanced.&nbsp;</p><p>“People are online more often. I have some friends from Blair who I play with… and then my sister also has the game, so a lot of times I'll come over to her island and screw stuff up,” Nesin said. “It's really fun to get to experience that together. There are certain things where there are big advantages to having friends you can play with.”</p><p>In the midst of a tumultuous climate, <em>New Horizons </em>has helped Nesin stay stable. “It helps keep you sane,” he said. “When nothing really feels like it's happening in quarantine, there's stuff happening here, at least."</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33085"></div><p>Aya Kyogoku, the director of the <em>Animal Crossing</em> series, speaks similarly of the game. “The game can provide those practicing social isolation with a place that can relieve them of anxiety and stress,” she said in an interview with The New Yorker.</p><p>Since the release of its first game in 2001, <em>Animal Crossing </em>has always been about bringing people together in the face of loneliness and hard times. The game, along with Pokémon, was created near the end of Japan’s Lost Decade (1991-2001), when the country faced severe economic stagnation and the family unit was far more fragmented.&nbsp;</p><p>“The pressures of modern life made it hard for everyone’s schedules to line up,” New York University game designer Naomi Clark, who lived in Japan as a child, said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. “The picture of a family who rarely gets to spend time together became increasingly common.”</p><p>When families could not be together in person, <em>Animal Crossing</em> provided an opportunity to connect online. “Kids will go to school in the morning, and while they’re at school their mothers will pick up the game and play and leave letters for their children,” Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto said at a developers’ roundtable at the video game convention E3 in 2006. “And then the children will come home from school and play the game and read letters from their mom… And then the dad will come home after working away at the office. He’ll sit down and play the game and will read letters from his children. And the game enhances communication that way.”</p><p>Likewise, <em>New Horizons</em> has provided Nesin with time with friends that he could not have otherwise had while on lockdown.&nbsp;</p><p>“It hasn't replaced real-life interaction, because obviously there are people who I want to interact with who don't have the game, but it's been something that makes me feel closer to other people,” he said. “It's been something where I look forward to being able to go to [my friend]'s town and send her a letter, and it makes me feel less quarantined."</p><p><br></p>	33086
32235	Blazers win the Battle of the Boulevard to advance to state playoffs	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair boys' soccer team (8-6) beat the Northwood Gladiators (6-8) by a score of 3-1 to win the 4A North Region II Championship on Tuesday. The state championship bracket will be reseeded based on the teams' regular season record.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32234"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers came out swinging. Five minutes into the game, junior defender Brian Sermeno headed in a corner kick, giving Blair a 1-0 lead. The Blazers extended their lead to 2-0, as the Gladiators' goalkeeper failed to secure senior defender Silas Reitsma's corner kick. The Gladiators then struck back on a free kick from the side of the box, sneaking it past junior goalkeeper Donovan Cox and going into halftime down 2-1.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the second half, senior forward Natinael Tesfaw scored off a through ball from Reitsma, bringing the Blazers' lead back up two goals at 3-1. Later in the half, junior defender Wilson Cruz Rivera fouled inside the box and gave Northwood a penalty kick. After senior goalkeeper Brennan Moore saved the penalty kick, the buzzer sounded, and there it was: the Blazers had won their first regional championship since 1965.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sermeno played in his first career varsity start for this game. "It feels good, I got cut my freshman and sophomore year, so scoring a goal in the regional final, it's pretty amazing, it feels great," Sermeno said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers are moving on to the state quarterfinals, giving them a chance to go to the state championship. "We're looking forward to it, we're going to take it one game at a time and keep on building, we have a lot to work on and we'll be back at practice tomorrow," Moore said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next playoff game at and against Leonardtown High School on Nov. 1 at 7 p.m. The Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA) state playoff bracket can be found </em><a href="https://mpssaa.countysports.zone/?bracket=1227" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>here.</em></a></p>	32234
31909	Mayor Catherine Pugh steps down, leaving Blazers questioning the image of political officials	<p>On May 2, Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh took permanent leave after state and federal investigations found that she had been profiting off her own children's book series, Healthy Holly.</p><p>The details of the scandal surfaced early in March when the Baltimore Sun released a report detailing the events concerning Pugh's sale of children’s books to organizations that were seeking multimillion-dollar city contracts. The report led state and federal investigators to look into records of Pugh's office, houses and non-profit organizations.</p><p>In 2011, Pugh sold $500,000 worth of Healthy Holly books to the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) while on its board. The UMMS would later enter a contract with the city of Baltimore to pay for public safety in 2016. As a prime example of conflict of interest, Pugh exploited her position on board for personal benefit.</p><p>In 2015, Healthy Holly LLC., the organization Pugh developed into a legal firm, donated $5,000 to Pugh’s campaign for mayor.</p><p>From 2015 to 2018, Kaiser Permanente paid $114,000 to Pugh while the company was seeking another multimillion-dollar contract with Baltimore.</p><p>Though Pugh initially called this investigation a “witch hunt,” she later apologized for her actions. “I am sorry for the harm I have caused to the image of the city of Baltimore and the credibility of the office of the mayor,” she wrote in her official statement.</p><p>The results of the investigations created further controversy in a city that has historically had a negative reputation. “I’ve heard there’s a big heroin problem there.

31710	What is the AAF?	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Troy Polamalu, Hines Ward, Justin Tuck and Jared Allen are gearing up for football season. These retired NFL stars are </span><a href="https://aaf.com/leadership" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">executives</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in the Alliance of American Football (AAF), a new football league that is starting play on February 9, a week after the Super Bowl. Despite the season starting soon, not much is known about the AAF. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to their website, </span><a href="https://aaf.com/about" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">The AAF</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is a league that will showcase former college football players and players in the Canadian Football League (CFL). The goal of the AAF is to help the players through bonuses, health insurance and college scholarships. Any AAF player will have the ability to join the NFL if a team signs them. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The AAF is going to feature teams in areas that are less covered by other professional sports. The teams are the Atlanta Legends, the Birmingham Iron, the Orlando Apollos, the Memphis Express, the San Antonio Commanders, the Arizona Hotshots, the Salt Lake City Stallions and the San Diego Fleet. The </span><a href="https://aaf.com/rileys-ready-for-new-beginnings-and-footballs-return-san-antonio" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">coaches</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> are former players and/or coaches in the NCAA or NFL.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It remains to be seen how much success the league will have. Previous lower tier football leagues, like the XFL have failed to garner attention. Other leagues like the CFL, however, were able to find success. With a lot of former NFL players and executives supporting this league, the AAF has a shot at satisfying the public's desire for more football after the Super Bowl, especially after a low excitement Super Bowl 53.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31709
32684	Montgomery County Board of Education has to decide whether to leave room for better toilet paper in the 2021 budget	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When the county Board of Education sits down to create the Montgomery County Public School (MCPS) budget every year, they are faced with some difficult decisions. How will they meet the demands of the teachers’ union? How will they address the ever-growing number of students in elementary, middle and high schools? Which buildings are most desperate for repairs? This year, they were confronted with an even more pressing issue: should the 2021 budget increase in order to provide schools with two-ply toilet paper?</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32683"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Cabin John Middle School student body president Sekayi Fraser is leading the effort to increase the quality of toilet paper in MCPS and testified at a budget meeting Jan. 13. He presented his case for two-ply toilet paper, saying that the proposal was the main reason for his election. “It feels rough as sandpaper and very thin which has led to many uncomfortable circumstances for students,” Fraser explained to the Board of Education. “I have over 100 signatures on a petition advocating for better toilet paper from Cabin John’s eighth grade alum.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Feb. 10 the Montgomery County Board of Education passed the tentative budget for the 2021 fiscal year which, to Fraser’s disappointment, did not include money for two-ply toilet paper. The budget will be handed over to the Montgomery County Council for approval Feb. 28 when members will make the final decision on whether or not to include this increase in funds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While there is no denying that the toilet paper in our schools is far from perfect, a slight improvement in our bathroom experience is hardly worth spending thousands of taxpayer dollars on. By increasing the quality of toilet paper in MCPS, the county will be spending an extra $31,000 per year on top of their current $200,000+ toilet paper budget. On top of the high cost, an increase in ply potentially increases plumbing issues. Repairing these damages would cost the county even more. It is not worth paying an extra $4.45 per case of toilet paper if it runs the risk of severe damage to infrastructure.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some students believe that there are ventures more deserving of funding than toilet paper. “There are other things that money could better be used on, like repairing buildings that are falling apart,” junior Tatiana Beltran said. Not only would the county be spending money that could be used on much better things, but the money spent on toilet paper would be quickly wasted by inconsiderate students.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many students lack a certain amount of respect and responsibility. School bathrooms are often vandalized, leaving toilet paper strewn all over. Considering the sizable amount of toilet paper that can be seen on the floors of school bathrooms, it would be a ridiculous waste to spend even more on this misused resource. “Kids take toilet paper and basically vandalize the resources that we have. There is probably a good percentage of that toilet paper that never gets used, that will get thrown on the floor and wasted,” Blair teacher George Mayo said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">No matter how convincing Fraser’s argument for comfier toilet paper, MCPS cannot justify spending an extra $31,000 of taxpayer money on toilet paper that students are guaranteed to misuse. The Board of Education has faced the reality of how kids treat their resources and realized that two-ply is not worth it and hopefully the Montgomery County Council will agree.</span></p>	32683
33106	In the absence of sports as we know them due to the ongoing global pandemic, Managing Sports Editor Ethan Park reflects on why pro sports are so culturally important	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33105"></div><p>It&nbsp;feels a bit funny to write a sports column at this point in our human history.</p><p>For as long as most Americans can remember, sports have always been a constant. Even during World War II, when the majority of male baseball players went off to war, women stepped up to the plate and kept the game running. After disasters like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, sports gave a grieving country something to cheer for. But now, with the whole world—sports included—at a standstill, there’s frankly not too much to have a sports-related opinion about.</p><p>But in a time when writing a sports column of any kind seems futile amid the much larger problems in the world, this hiatus from sports has forced me to take pause and truly consider why sports are worth writing about in the first place.</p><p>There are few things in our society around which people can rally regardless of race, gender, sexuality, or politics—and sports are often one of them. Sports lure people in with spectacles of highlight plays and impressive displays of athleticism, but reels them in further with the truly unique community that it fosters. The thousands of people gathered for championship parades and tears of joy after a big win show how much sports mean to fans who relish this sense of community. And with that community comes a deep pride for one’s team that can give fans the one thing that so many people need right now: a sense of purpose.</p><p>This spirit of purpose within sports fans is not lost, even though any sense of normal routine has dissipated. In fact, the most heartening thing to come out of this quarantine for a sports editor like myself is that even without any sports on live television, the sports community may be more alive than ever.</p><p>One only has to log onto social media to see how sports fans are filling this void and keeping the spirit of sports alive. Many fans have taken to Twitter and Instagram to do what they do best by arguing, showing how much they care about their cities’ sports teams. Fans valiantly defend the honor of their favorite teams and players, displaying that sense of purpose and reinvigorating the competition and camaraderie that fuel sports on all levels.</p><p>Dozens of Twitter threads clutter the timeline, debating who would have hypothetically won the NBA championship or who had the best performance in the NFL Draft. And as if these existing debates weren’t enough to rile up sports fans across the internet, ESPN added gasoline to the fire with their docu-series on Michael Jordan and the 1997-98 Chicago Bulls.</p><p>With never-before-seen footage of Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, and head coach Phil Jackson in their final season with Chicago, each episode of the series reopened a can of worms regarding Jordan’s “Greatest of All Time (GOAT)” status.</p><p>Usually, arguments about the true GOAT of the NBA—often between the fans of Jordan and those of LeBron James—are long, winding roads to nowhere. As much as they show fans’ devotion to their respective superstars, they often end up with much more talking (or typing) than listening. But in this day and age, arguments about a GOAT title based primarily on the shaky grounds of subjectivity are reassuring to read, reminding me that the spirit of rivalry that sports bring out of fans and players alike is still truly alive.</p><p>While scrolling through arguments about who the greatest basketball player really is or reading the analysis and discussion following the NFL Draft, these past months have reaffirmed that the beauty of sports is their ability to create and foster community. Though sports may seem like a strange thing to care about with so much going on in the world, people find value in them because of the purpose it gives them, providing the groundwork for friendly (or not-so-friendly) competition in the face of such isolation and hardship.</p><p>Although it may be many more weeks before we get to see our favorite players lace up and hit the field or court, this time of reflection and online arguments should remind us to be thankful for the passion, purpose, and never-ending disputes that sports give us.&nbsp;</p>	33105
33035	An Opinion	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been a critical piece of my own political socialization. She showed me and so many other young women that we have a place in this world––not only as lawyers and jurists, but as strong advocates and leaders, too. Ginsburg fought for and secured a number of women's rights, including—but not limited to—the ability to take out credit cards in our own names and to purchase and lease properties without a male co-signer.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the same time, I have to recognize that Ginsburg was not the perfect progressive she is often idolized as.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Her progressivism was not intersectional—several of her rulings were harmful to already marginalized groups. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ginsburg ruled against tribal jurisdiction over tribal-owned land. In 2016, she famously criticized Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players for refusing to stand during the national anthem, calling their actions “really dumb.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though Ginsburg eventually expressed regret for her Native-related rulings and retracted her harmful statement, the damage was done: She set a precedent that lower courts relied on to repeatedly dismiss Native land claims, and she invalidated Black trauma by rebuking protests against police brutality and systemic racism.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ruth Bader Ginsburg can be both: She can have been the last line of defense for so many of my basic rights—marrying whomever I love, accessing safe abortions and contraceptive options, and consenting to my own medical treatment—while also being the figurehead of white feminism.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I am terrified of what the future will bring now that there is an open seat on the Supreme Court, terrified that my own civil rights are in jeopardy. While I will forever be grateful for her leadership in the fight for gender equality, women like myself who are fortunate enough to benefit from her activism must also recognize that this progress was not real for many marginalized communities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a nation, we need to continue Ginsburg’s work in tearing down gender roles, promoting equal wages, and advancing bodily autonomy. But our intention should not be to simply replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It should be to do better than Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</span></p>	33031
33016	How serious are the privacy issues with online school?	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) reach the three-month milestone of school, teachers and students are settling into a normal routine. However, even as everyone begins to familiarize themselves with virtual learning and the recording of classes, privacy issues bring about controversies, including the questions - how private is student information right now and how concerned should students be about their privacy?</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33015"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many, if not all, students value their privacy immensely, especially when in respect to school. Junior Gelila Isayas views her information as something she does not want shared with people she does not trust, and this may include anyone from government officials to teachers. "When it comes to school - unless I can completely trust the person or the application - I value my privacy a lot," says Isayas. With the new technology brought in by online learning, a lot of student information that used to be private is now open to teachers and supervisors. For example, teachers have access to all student emails on Synergy, including drafts. All of these current technologies used for online school severely reduce student privacy, which should be protected regardless of the circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Privacy provides boundaries and allows us to keep our information safe from outside authorities that could easily utilize it in harmful ways. As students, we release a lot of information to MCPS, including but not limited to: our addresses, our health details, our test scores and more. As a result, multiple controversies have arisen concerning student privacy since online school began.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Zoom recordings are a primary concern. MCPS has required teachers to record their classes so that students who were absent can watch the class recordings to catch up. Although this is a good plan for helping students who miss class, recording Zoom meetings can easily be seen as an invasion of a student's privacy. Some may argue that students have the ability to turn their camera off if they feel uncomfortable with being taped, but teachers often encourage students to turn on their camera to observe student feedback and increase class participation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/confessions-community-college-dean/should-showing-faces-be-mandatory" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Inside Higher Ed</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, professors stated that it was disheartening to teach to "a bunch of black boxes with names on them." The article continued to explain that calling on said boxes regularly ensued in awkward silence rather than the participation teachers were used to. Blair technology teacher John Kaluta emphasized that participation was necessary for him to understand his students. "There might be 6 or 8 [students] that really aren't paying attention as closely as you'd like. In a classroom, you can see that. You kind of walk over their way and remind them, 'we're doing this right now.,'" He said. "But on Zoom, if their camera's not on and I can't see their face, I can't really tell."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One major concern with Zoom recordings is consent for recording.&nbsp;When a teacher begins videotaping, a pop-up notification informs students that a recording has started. However, the recording starts before the student presses 'continue' or leaves the meeting. Junior Asher Labovich expressed his unease with Zoom’s lack of consent. "[The Zoom meeting] starts recording you before you click 'continue'," he said. "There are problems with recording someone without their consent."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Another issue with virtual learning is the new ability of teachers to access student emails through Synergy, MCPS' newest education platform. Synergy’s main goal is to&nbsp;keep track of a student's transcripts, gradebook and emails to teachers. Students often conduct conversations with teachers through Synergy, sending them emails to ask about assignments. Synergy also allows teachers to view their students' emails, including drafts, sent emails and received emails. Kaluta further explained that he can view most student information through the platform. "The Synergy format is open record. For instance, if I needed or felt I needed to see something from another class of yours... I can get to that," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A further concern is the lack of awareness among Blair students. Both Labovich and Isayas communicated their surprise at hearing the news. "I never knew about [teacher's access to student emails] until you told me," Isayas said. With such an obvious invasion of privacy, the fact that so many students at Blair are unaware is simply unacceptable, compounded by the fact that emails are personal items that could easily cause harm if shared to other teachers or posted on a non-encrypted domain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Further concerning transparency issues, parents may </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/parents/Parents-Guide-To-Virtual-Recordings-20200904.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">opt their children out of Zoom lessons</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> if they feel it's important that their child is not recorded, but not all parents are aware of this fact. Even so, this form of opting-out could also cause major problems for students, as it could give them less time to effectively interact with the teacher.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both students and parents should be aware and knowledgeable of the privacy issues circling virtual learning right now. Students especially should know about a teacher's ability to view their emails through Synergy because it directly affects them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Virtual learning has been a rough transition for parents, students, and teachers, but that should not lessen the importance of privacy protection. With new technologies, including but not limited to Zoom, Synergy, Canvas etc., we must all be careful with our personal information in order to maintain a sense of security. All students should be conscious of when and where their privacy is being invaded as well as be aware of how to keep their personal information safe.</span></p>	33015

33373	With quite the roller coaster of a season, the young WFT shows lots of promise for years to come	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This season, Washington Football Team (WFT) fans got dragged through a rollercoaster of emotions. The season started with the yearly disappointment that inherently comes with being a WFT fan, but ended with a considerable amount of hope.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Let's start with the quarterback carousel, another normality for the WFT. Dwayne Haskins was named the QB1 heading into the season. Once Week 5 came around, Kyle Allen was named the new starter, and Haskins was demoted to the third-string spot. Allen got a few starts before suffering a season-ending leg injury, which meant the probable Comeback Player of the Year Alex Smith had to start at QB for the first time since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Smith won four of his first five starts. But, Haskins was called upon after </span><a href="https://washingtonfootballwire.usatoday.com/2021/01/18/injury-that-kept-alex-smith-out-of-playoff-game-was-bone-bruise-not-calf-strain/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Smith suffered a bone bruise</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to start in Week 15 and 16, losing both games, and being cut after Week 16. Smith started and won a must-win Week 17 game against the Philadelphia Eagles to clinch the NFC East, finishing the season 7-9.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">But, in a surprising turn of events, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/01/09/taylor-heinicke-washington-quarterback-alex-smith/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Smith was ruled inactive</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for the WFT's Wild Card matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This meant Taylor Heinicke, who was finishing his mathematics degree at Old Dominion just weeks before the game, was called upon to make his first NFL start against Tom Brady and the Bucs in a wild card game. Heinicke showed a strong performance, completing 26 passes for 306 yards with one passing touchdown, one rushing touchdown, and an interception. Heinicke did all of this after suffering a </span><a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10000135-wfts-taylor-heinicke-played-through-separated-shoulder-injury-vs-buccaneers" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">separated shoulder</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in the second half and gave the all-powerful Tampa Bay offense a run for their money. Ultimately, the WFT lost 31-23, but I thought Heinicke proved himself as a real candidate to be our starter next year.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33372"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We can't talk about the WFT's season without admiring their young, exciting defense. Newly-signed defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio's defense was second in total yards per game, second in passing yards per game, fourth in points per game, and tied-for-seventh in takeaways, a huge improvement from last year. NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year frontrunner Chase Young ended with 44 tackles, seven and a half sacks, four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, and a touchdown. Rookie safety Kamren Curl proved he was a seventh-round steal for the WFT, finishing with 88 total tackles, four tackles for loss, two sacks, four pass deflections, three interceptions, and a touchdown. Resigning cornerback Ronald Darby and signing a new inside linebacker would greatly bolster this defense.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With this quarterback rotation and not a lot of weapons, the WFT's offense wasn't great this year. The defense should be applauded for keeping us in games. On a league wide basis, our offense was near the bottom of every stat, ending 30th in total yards, 25th in passing yards, 26th in rushing yards, and 25th in points. But, we do have the right to be excited about our current weapons in wide receivers Terry McLaurin and Cam Sims, running backs Antonio Gibson and J.D. McKissic, and tight end Logan Thomas.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">WFT's offensive line, led by AP All-Pro first team guard Brandon Scherff, was </span><a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-final-2020-offensive-line-rankings" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">ranked sixth</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in the league by Pro Football Focus. We absolutely need to resign Scherff this offseason. With rookie left tackle Saahdiq Charles returning from injury, there is certainly promise there. If Washington can add another wide receiver to accompany McLaurin and Cam Sims, that offense has potential to be very dangerous.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The biggest concern this offseason, though, is the quarterback situation. Smith was very successful as a starter this season, with a 5-1 record, but it was apparent that he lost a lot of agility and athleticism, which is no surprise after a broken leg. Allen will be back and ready to play this season, and of course the playoff hero Heinicke is in the mix.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Not to mention, there are several offseason moves that can be made for a quarterback. Most notably, the WFT could trade for Houston QB and 2020 NFL passing yards leader Deshaun Watson. There are also a number of free agents available, most notably Dallas' Dak Prescott. Washington should definitely make a push for one of these three. If not, drafting a quarterback with our first-round pick would also be a solid option. If Washington drafts a QB, such as Alabama's Mac Jones or North Dakota State's Trey Lance, they would probably have to trade up in the draft.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We saw, especially in Heinicke's playoff performance, that Washington really benefits from having a mobile quarterback. A mobile quarterback would be the missing puzzle piece that the WFT needs to have a legitimate offense. Lance, Watson, and Heinicke are all great options in that regard, while Watson is also an amazing passer. I would love to see a major push for Watson this offseason, he is a top-three quarterback in the NFL and would certainly boost us to a top-10 offense. But, if we're absolutely unable to acquire a mobile QB this offseason, I would be excited to see Heinicke start in week 1.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lastly, I have to say, this team wouldn't be anywhere near where they ended without the great leadership of head coach Ron Rivera. For once, I think we have a smart front office that will listen to Rivera and we will make the right choices this offseason. This team is young, shows a lot of promise, and has a pretty great coaching staff around it. I'm excited to see what this team can do next year and for years to come.</span></p>	33372
33520	The Blazers defeat the Titans 4-0 despite changes in positions	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair Blazers (3-1) won against the Einstein Titans (2-2) with a score of 4-0 in their fourth game of the season on Friday. The Blazers started the first half with an aggressive offense and a solid defense that pushed back Einstein players when they had possession of the ball. Sophomore Elena Fernandez scored the first goal of the game, with 24 minutes remaining until half time. Later, Senior Hannah Tudge curved the soccer ball into the net to raise the score to 2-0. The heat was sweltering, but the Blazers’ kept their energy high.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Varsity coach Robert Gibb explained the new challenges this game presented. “We are missing a couple of players for a variety of reasons, including two of my starting defenders, so it is…an interesting game because we are playing some people in [positions] we don’t normally play them, but so far it's looking pretty good,” Gibb said at halftime.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;The Einstein Titans played much more aggressively than the Damascus Hornets, who the Blazers defeated last week with a score of 8-0. “They’re a little gritty, they’re physical, and they got some speed. They're definitely giving us a little more of a game,” Gibb said. This isn’t the Blazers’ first time playing against the Titans, as Tudge recalls. “We played them before in pre-season games and we didn’t do so well against them. But the people that have filled the shoes of our graduating seniors have stepped up to face the challenge,” Tudge commented. “This game in particular, I think we started out a little slow and sluggish, but after we got our first point everyone started to come together and really connect.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The second half of the game was a brilliant display of the Blazers’ teamwork and tact, as passes were quick and clean, and most of the game was played on the offensive side. About 13 minutes into the second half, sophomore Simone Hargove clinched the Blazers’ third goal. The Titans’ goalkeeper successfully blocked a number of goal attempts made by the Blazers, which made scoring difficult. Finally, Tudge made the last goal, her second goal of the game.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Freshman Helen Zekaris made it a point to applaud her teammates after the game. “I think the game went very well. We had four goals in, and I’m excited for what’s to come. I wanna give a special shout-out to Hannah because she scored two goals, and I think our defense was amazing,” Zekaris said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers will play their next home game against the Northwood Gladiators on Thursday, Sep. 30 at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	33519
33285	Una opinión	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEn los últimos meses, protestas nacionales se han manifestado a favor del movimiento de Black Lives Matter (“Las Vidas Negras Importan” o BLM). A causa de estas protestas, las frases “latinxs para BLM” y “latinxs para vidas negras” han surgido, pero estas frases tienen el efecto contrario de la supuesta intención original.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tUno de los retos del BLM es protestar contra la brutalidad policial, lo cual afecta afroamericanos desproporcionadamente. La frase “latinxs para vidas negras” comenzó como forma de mostrar solidaridad entre latinxs y afroamericanos, especialmente como entre etnias los latinxs tienen tasas altas de tiroteos fatales hechos por la policía comparada con la población general de EE.UU.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33284"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tSin embargo, al decir “latinxs para vidas negras,” se crea una separación innecesaria y dañina. Esta frase separa a los latinxs y afroamericanos como si fueran dos categorías, dos entidades opuestas. Al hacer esta separación, los afrolatinxs son ignorados y continuamos la ilusión de que una persona no puede ser latinx y afroamericana.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAdemás, la frase pone el enfoque en la persona que no es afroamericana, en vez de personas afroamericanas, como debería ser. Si el objetivo es elevar las voces afroamericanas, ¿por qué tenemos que incluir a los latinxs que no son afroamericanos? ¿Por qué nosotros, los latinxs que no somos afroamericanos, somos incapaces de poner las voces de los afroamericanos al centro sin hablar de nosotros mismos?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDe la misma forma, cuando afroamericanos celebran éxitos en sus luchas, latinxs que no son afroamericanos tienen algún impulso de incluirse en ese éxito, típicamente de forma negativa.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tJohn Leguizamo, un actor latinx reclamo que afroamericanos recibieron más nominaciones para los premios Emmys del 2020 que latinxs tuitiando, “por que es que nosotros los latinxs on podemos un pedazo del pie?” Latinxs con esta mentalidad casi nunca incluyen a afrolatinxs cuando hacen estas declaraciones.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEn su tuit, Leguizamo citó un artículo del LA Times, donde el autor Michael Ordoña escribió, “No ha habido artistas latinos entre las nominaciones de actores principales y secundarios para series de drama o comedia en los últimos seis años.” Sin embargo, en los Emmys del 2019, Jharrel Jerome, un actor afro-Dominicano, ganó la categoría de actor principal para la serie de drama, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When They See Us</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. Incluso, Jerome es el primer afrolatinx en ganar un premio de actuación en los Emmys. Lo que es más irónico es que Leguízamo también actuó en </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When They See Us</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, pero por alguna razón fue capaz de ignorar el afrolatinx que trabajó en la misma serie con él.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Similarmente, cuando la película <em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Black Panther</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, lo cual tuvo un elenco con mayoría afroamericanas y personas de raza negra, se estrenó, muchos latinxs reclamaron, preguntando, “cuándo podemos los latinxs tener nuestro propio </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Black Panther</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">?” Esta pregunta no viene del deseo de tener representación latinx, pero representación de latinxs blancos. Cuando hay representación latinx, que también es representación afrolatinx, latinxs que no son afroamericanos, como Leguizamo, lo ignoran y no están satisfechos. A menudo, los latinxs que no son afroameriancos no consideran representacion afrolatinx como representación latinx.&nbsp;</span></p><p>La crítica de falta de representación latinx suele salir cuando afroamericanos finalmente reciben representación. Cuando la película <em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Crazy Rich Asians</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, quien tuvo un elenco con mayoría de asiáticos se estrenó, no hubo el mismo enojo en la comunidad latinx que el estreno de </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Black Panther</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. El hecho que las críticas de falta de representación latinx son apuntadas afroamericanos más que a la cultura de la blancura demuestra el propósito verdadero de las críticas, especialmente debido a que varios latinxs benefician de la cultura de la blancura y la supremacía blanca.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Una de las razones por lo cual los éxitos de la comunidad afroamericana son vistos como negativos por la comunidad latinx es porque a menudo usamos afroamericanos como una medida de nuestra humanidad. En un tuit, la historiadora Jade Bentil explica, “personas de raza negra son los contrastes que personas que no son de raza negra usan para medir su humanidad. Nuestra [las personas de raza negra] sujeción sirve como la <span style="color: rgb(0, 121, 107);">basisbase</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> de posibilidad para su propio acceso a la humanidad. Entonces cuando personas de raza negra son *percibidos* como ‘ganando’, se produce una crisis - el mundo ya no tiene sentido”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEn otras palabras, latinxs que no son afroamericanos no pueden aceptar que personas afroamericanas tienen más representación que ellos porque todavía ven a personas afroamericanas como muchos de ellos y conflictúa con nuestra percepción que somos mejores que afroamericanos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDeclarando solidaridad con el BLM por decir “latinxs para vidas negras” ignora los problemas de racismo contra los afroamericanos en la comunidad latinx. Como latinxs que no somos afroamericanos, no podemos declarar solidaridad sin hablar sobre el racismo en nuestra comunidad y activamente trabajar contra el racismo.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEsta declaración de solidaridad es insincera, especialmente cuando dictamos el racismo contra afroamericanos como paralelo a la discrimnacion contra los latinxs. Nuestros obstáculos no son lo mismo que los obstáculos de afroamericanos, además latinxs que no somos afroamericanos contribuimos al racismo que afroamericanos enfrentan.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFrecuentemente, los latinxs usamos la excusa de que cosas son diferentes en latinoamérica y el racismo es diferente allá. Es verdad que el racismo se presenta de forma diferente en latinoamérica, pero el hecho que cosas son diferentes es un indicador de que ignoramos el racismo tanto que está normalizado.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMientras el racismo contra afroamericanos siga en nuestros subconscientes, en nuestras familias, en la comunidad latinx, nuestra solidaridad siempre será insincera. Al momento, lo que podemos hacer es trabajar en corregir nuestros comportamientos y pensamientos racistas. También es importante corregir el pensamiento de los grupos a nuestro alrededor. Si escuchas un amigo que no es afroamericano usar la palabra “n” o un miembro de tu familia usar una frase con connotaciones raciales, deberías corregirles. Lo más importante es escuchar, escuchar a la comunidad afroamericana para saber cual es la mejor forma de apoyarlos. </span></p>	33284

32382	Families, board members and other community members have voiced mixed opinions	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Plans for the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) 2020-2021 calendar have reignited the debate about closing school on Eid-al-Fitr, a Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting. In past years, the Board of Education has scheduled a professional day to coincide with Eid, which varies according to the Islamic lunar calendar. However, because Eid will fall on May 13, 2021, an official Advanced Placement (AP) exam date for English Language and Composition, Microeconomics and Music Theory classes, county officials face a difficult situation in planning for next year.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32381"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Muslim students and families around the county have expressed support for next year's closure. Other community members have voiced opposition, citing testing schedule disruptions and Montgomery County's relatively low Muslim </span><a href="https://www.bestplaces.net/religion/county/maryland/montgomery" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">population</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> of 1.2 percent as not enough reason to close school for a full day.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Several Board members, including President Shebra Evans, </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/boe/Singer-Jeremy-AP-Exam-Date-V2.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">sent a letter</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to senior officials at the College Board encouraging the organization to remove the day from the testing schedule. "Muslim students would experience an unintended consequence by observing their religious holiday on a day designated for AP exam administration," Evans wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Because MCPS holidays are based on state-mandated closures and expected student attendance, several community members opposed a closure for Eid. "It is not an equitable practice to make the Muslim holidays the only days that are determined based on religious reasons," Laurie Halverson, former District 15 candidate for Maryland's House of Delegates, </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/schools/debate-continues-over-whether-mcps-should-close-for-muslim-holiday/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">commented</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> on the Bethesda Beat.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In a comprehensive calendar </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/calendar/2019-2020%20Sch%20Yr%20Calendar%20Revised%20181009.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">survey</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> conducted by the county in October 2018, 91 percent of parents said their children would attend school on Eid-al-Fitr. Only 11 percent of families answered that a closure for Eid is "very important" to them, leading individuals to advocate against closing school for a small portion of the county's students.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich and County Council members Gabe Albornoz, Tom Hucker, Will Jawando and Hans Riemer wrote a letter to the Board of Education advocating for the closure and for the county to move forward in negotiations with the College Board. "The Muslim community wants to be able to practice their faith without the concern of missing a test, or missing some other really important educational item," Albornoz said. "We just felt, as representatives of county residents, that we wanted to issue our support for their concerns."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Under current MCPS policy, students who want to observe a religious holiday that is not built into the school calendar will receive an excused absence. However, Muslim students say an excused absence is not enough; the county's acknowledgment of the holiday's religious origin is important to them. "It's wrong to say that the absence is the same as being sick. I'm not missing it because I want to, I'm missing it because it's a religious obligation," Blair senior Adiba Chowdhury said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Currently, the nearby Howard and Baltimore Counties, which have Muslim-affiliated populations of less than one </span><a href="https://www.bestplaces.net/religion/county/maryland/howard" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">percent</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and 1.2 </span><a href="https://www.bestplaces.net/religion/county/maryland/baltimore" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">percent</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> respectively, have a school closure for Eid built into their 2020-2021 public school calendars as a professional development day. According to Essie McGuire, executive director of the MCPS Office of the Chief Operating Officer, both counties are still awaiting information from the College Board on how to adjust the closure in accordance with the May 13 AP testing date.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As county and school officials deliberate over the closure, student diversity and resident opinions continue to be at the forefront of the conversation. "I think it's a strength that we have a very diverse community," Albornoz said.&nbsp;"There are lots of areas in which the county is going to have to be even more flexible than it has been in the past to accommodate the diverse needs of our residents."&nbsp;</span></p>	32381
32290	The story behind Blair girls' varsity soccer head coach Robert Gibb	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair girls' varsity soccer team has been successful this season. They had an official regular season record of 9-3 and won their fourth straight division title before advancing to the state semifinals for the first time in team history. But these are only the most recent coaching accomplishments for head coach Robert Gibb, who has coached the team for 30 years. Gibb discovered his passion for soccer at a summer camp when he was five or six years old. His counselor was from England, and therefore was much more familiar with soccer than other sports. "We probably played more soccer than most people," he recalled.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Right away, Gibb took to the sport, joining his first team when Montgomery Soccer, Inc. (MSI) first began in 1971 when he was about ten years old. His father was his assistant coach, but later took over as head coach after the original head coach got kicked out of the league. "Our coach was a crazy, Italian guy who actually got thrown out of the league for flying off the handle at a ten-year-old's soccer team," he said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gibb's father was the one who first inspired him to become a coach. "Although he didn't know the game that well, he really enjoyed it, and he really was good at getting the team to play well and really getting everyone to enjoy the experience," Gibb said. Gibb's own first coaching job was for a local MSI team around the same time that he entered high school. The head coach was the father of one of the players, but didn't know much about soccer, so Gibb and one of his good friends volunteered to help him out. They ended up pretty much coaching the team themselves, "the Cheetahs," Gibb recalls.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">His second coaching experience, which also happened to be his first (but nowhere near last) time coaching high school girls, came just a few years later when he was a senior in high school. There were no girls' soccer teams in Montgomery County at the time, so Gibb coached a girls' club team that consisted primarily of girls from his high school, Walter Johnson.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After coming to Blair, Gibb continued his coaching career and passion for girls' soccer. He created the first girls' junior varsity (JV) soccer team at Blair in 1990. Since the teams' inception, the JV team has never had a losing season, and the varsity team has only had two.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although Gibb can't quite put a finger on the source of this success, he thinks it has something to do with their chemistry and the diverse blend of players that he coaches. "In Montgomery County, we're the only multi-ethnic team that is successful year-in and year-out," he said. "We have some players with a lot of experience, club-level, [who] play in Bethesda, Potomac, some of the other really top clubs, and we have some players who may have played a lot with boys," he added.﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32288"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This unique mixture of players comes with lots of different playing styles, and as a coach, Gibb has to figure out what strategies will work best given this group. "It's my job to blend them together, and make a system that works for everybody," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He also attributes some of their success to the fact that the players enjoy being around each other, and they try to have fun at practice while improving. Gibb recalls teams that he has played for in the past where practices were like "torture sessions" and coaches were "tyrants." Although he loved the game, he didn't love everything that came with it, so he tries to keep a positive environment in his practices and a positive team dynamic in general.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gibb's favorite part of coaching is spending time with his players. "With the girls, it's just fun to be with them, and it's fun to play the beautiful game together, particularly after a tough day in the classroom," he said. He knows that the players like spending time together, too, and he uses that to incentivize them to win. "Each game, I remind them, I say, you know, if you win, we have practice tomorrow, you know, if you win, then this team is still alive," he said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This is especially true during the playoffs. Once their season is over, the team is never the same. Seniors will leave and new players will join. Gibb hopes his current team will last as long as it can. "This entity will only exist until the clock strikes twelve, which, hopefully, will be at the state championship game," he said. This year's team met their original goal of qualifying for state quarterfinals, but unfortunately weren't able to advance past the semifinals.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32289"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gibb has faith that the girls' team will continue to have success, for sure as long as he is coaching, and hopefully for much longer. He believes that good, long-term coaching is one of the keys to success for any team anywhere and he can only hope that his successor will bring the same quality coaching to Blair that he's been bringing for the past thirty years. "When I choose to walk off into the sunset, I hope somebody that has the same passion that I have for the game, and for my players, comes in and takes over," he said.</span></p><p><br></p>	32289
32192	SCO predicts NFL awards and outlines the playoff picture for the second half of the season	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The 2019-2020 National Football League (NFL) season has been an interesting one. Surprisingly good teams, breakout performances and season changing injuries have shaken up the league. I will be predicting the playoff picture and giving out the mid-season MVP award.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32191"></div><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">NFL playoff picture</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At this point, it is safe to say both the San Francisco 49ers and the New England Patriots are making the playoffs. Both teams are undefeated, and are home to some of the best defenses in the league. Behind the Patriots, the American Football Conference (AFC) has four teams—the Colts, the Texans, the Chiefs and the Ravens—vying to be the number two seed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I predict the Chiefs will be the team to pull away from the pack and take the number two spot, once star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, recovers from a dislocated knee. This leaves the Texans, the Colts, the Ravens and the Bills to fill in the rest of Wildcard weekend. In the National Football Conference (NFC), the Packers and the Saints have both been looking unstoppable, each only losing one game. Either of these teams could take the top spot over the 49ers, but once the Saints get their future Hall of Fame quarterback, Drew Brees, back on the field, they will be the stronger team and likely take the top spot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If all three of these teams make the playoffs, the remaining three spots will come down to the Seahawks, the Cowboys, the Vikings and the Panthers. The Panthers are the weakest of these teams, despite an amazing season by running back Christian McCaffery. Once the playoff dust settles, the Patriots will be sitting at the top of the league once again, with star quarterback Tom Brady getting his seventh Super Bowl Ring.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mid-season MVP</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A lot of players have shown amazing performances this year, making the MVP race as close as it can get. Right now there are two quarterbacks and one running back pulling away from the competition: Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers and Christian McCaffery.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Russell Wilson, quarterback for the Seahawks, is having the best season of his career. He is tied for first in passing touchdowns with 15, and has only thrown one interception. Because of his tremendous season, the Seahawks are at a solid 5-2 and are one of the best teams in the league.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Aaron Rodgers, quarterback for the Packers, threw his name into the running with a six-touchdown performance in Week 7 against the Raiders, which improved the Packers' record to 6-1.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Christian McCaffery is the only running back who has a legitimate chance to win MVP due to his historic season with 923 total yards and nine total touchdowns. McCaffery has lead the Panthers to a 4-2 record, keeping them in the playoff picture.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Out of these three, Russell Wilson has been the most consistent, which is why he deserves the mid-season MVP. Because it is only halfway through the season, there is room for anything to happen. With the standings so close, changes in the playoff picture and end of season awards are inevitable. Look out for SCO's end of season review and a more accurate playoff picture soon!</span></p>	32191

It was hard for her to break the news to her dad; “when I finally told my dad, he was very upset,” she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">\tLike many other teen-moms, she wasn’t sure whether she wanted to </span><span style="color: rgb(60, 64, 67); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">keep the baby</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. She thought about terminating the pregnancy as well as offering her son up for adoption., “I thought about giving him up for adoption, but I went through a lot of stuff when I was pregnant and I was just like, no, I can’t do that. I just started to love him, especially when he started moving. Especially after he was born, I looked him and was like, 'no you’re not going anywhere.'”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31761"></div><p>\t<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Tobias's father is out of the picture, so Varn is a single parent. “I’m the mom and the dad, I’m doing pretty good at it”, she said. Varn is in the process of getting his rights revoked. She makes frequent visits to her lawyer. She has to give tubes of blood. The list goes on. The process has taken a toll on her mental health. “Mentally I was like, ‘when is this going to be over?’ I’m tired… it’s a lot, but you learn to just like go through it and just go to the end because you know you’re going to get something amazing,” she says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31762"></div><p>\t<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Varn is already thinking about how she will have to tell her son why he didn’t grow up with his father. “I’m more scared about his reaction to what happened, but like I hope that he sees the good side in it. Like even though that happened to your mom, I still kept you, and I still love you. I’m not scared of much, but I’m scared to tell him. I’m scared it’s going to break his heart, and I don’t want to break his heart.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">\tA lot of her friends and other mentors advised her to not talk to her son about her circumstance. She disagrees, knowing that her son will be curious and she will have to tell him the truth. “It’s messed up either way, but I have to tell him. “I was going to tell when he was around middle school, because that’s when they learn about consent stuff, so I was going to just sit him down and tell him,” she says. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31763"></div><p>\t<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Having a child is expensive. Many teen moms are forced to dropout of school to work to support their child. Varn considers herself “one of the lucky ones”. Much of her financial burden is lifted by programs such as the Women, Infants, and Children food-program (WIC). Her main expense is diapers and wipes. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">\tMany of her friends are also teen moms, but they have not had the same support. “Most people, it’s not easy for them, they have to pay out of pocket for a lot of things, babies are very expensive, like one can of baby formula is like 25 dollars, so I was lucky to have people who took time out of their day to give me all of these things and then for adults who gave me all of these resources so I wouldn’t have to pay for things. I was blessed and I was lucky [because] I didn’t have to find money,” Varn says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31764"></div><p>\t<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During her pregnancy, Tamera went and told the school nurse about her situation. “Our old school nurse, I finally talked to her, she gave me a bunch of numbers to call, a bunch of resources. She gave me a bunch of stuff. A baby tub, some diapers, a crib, she helped so much.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">\tShe also found support in the teen-mom support-group at Blair. There is both a Spanish and English-speaking group. According to Varn, “They’re like family, that’s my family right there. All of us have beautiful kids, all of us are great moms, we help each other out. The teen mom group here is amazing, like I literally feel like these are my family members.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31765"></div><p><br></p>	31763
32749	The Blazers start playoffs strong with a 53-41 victory over the Blue Devils	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s Varsity Girls’ Basketball team (14-8) beat the Springbrook Blue Devils (4-19) by a score of 53-41 on Feb. 28. The Blazers had a strong offensive showing, which played a major role in their victory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair started the night strong with four baskets by junior guard Kate Hildebrandt and multiple free throws in the first quarter. However, they began to lose their control in the second quarter, allowing the Blue Devils to quickly retaliate. Bad passes and hasty shots by the Blazers gave possessions to Springbrook and allowed them to score. Additionally, there were many instances where the Blazers took shots from one extreme side of the basket, but didn’t have anyone to rebound on the other side when the shots went long. This gave Springbrook rebounds and additional scoring opportunities. These little mistakes kept the game close, with Blair trailing 21-20 at halftime.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32748"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The third quarter was tense for both sides as each struggled to pull ahead. The score was tied four times throughout the quarter, until Blair finally pulled ahead to 31-30. Once Blair gained that lead, they didn’t look back. Strong passes, aggressive rebounds and extra energy kept the Blazers on top.&nbsp;“We weren’t scared of anything. We drove with confidence and we just finished,” Hildebrandt said. A collective 22 points in the fourth quarter secured Blair’s 53-41 victory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Compared to previous games, the Blazers' defense and offense were both on point this time around. Hildebrant’s 17 points, senior captain and guard Zoe Abramson’s 13 points, and freshman guard Natalie Frost’s 12 points helped propel Blair on the scoreboard. On the defense front, senior guard-forward Lucy Martin, sophomore guard-forward Sayara Thomas and freshman guard Amelia Martin got a collective total of 14 defensive rebounds. Abramson described the defense strategy and how it improved throughout the night. “I think at the beginning we struggled, but switching up into a zone helped us bring up our energy level. Going back to a man-to-man defense, we really worked on trapping the drives and making sure that they couldn’t get open shots,” she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Abramson also explained how the team kept spirits high, despite the lead changing hands multiple times. “It was just knowing we weren’t going to accept losing. We did not want to lose to Springbrook. We knew we had to get a couple more points than them, so we just focused on that,” she concluded.&nbsp;</span></p>	32748
33108	Press release announcing the Editorial Board's re-endorsement, originally released on Twitter (@Silver_Chips)	<p><strong style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">ON SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, </strong><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Silver Chips released comments</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fo4n7dzz4i3gI4Xg2H6WDvmOJYK74FXdKbLuO2hXE_8/edit" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"> from Lynne Harris and Sunil Dasgupta</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">, the two candidates for the At-Large seat on the Board of Education, about school reopening plans. These statements spurred countywide contention, as many felt Harris’ remarks unfairly blamed teachers for the numerous pitfalls of virtual learning; Harris issued clarifying remarks in a blog post </span><a href="https://www.lynne4students.org/post/getting-back-to-school-a-safe-pragmatic-approach-let-s-start-from-yes?fbclid=IwAR3zZT8up-pXIOdhqHHQEIyhtPQw8yrDop2GGjsUwpG7prcdXr2SCRy8lME" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here.</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">After extensive research and a forum held by the Silver Chips Editorial Board with both candidates, the Editorial Board is proud to endorse Harris for the At-Large seat on the Board of Education, upholding the </span><a href="https://www.silverchips.org/2020/05/lynne-harris-for-board-of-education-at.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">decision made in May</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">. As a champion for student voices and an experienced MCPS teacher, Harris will bring necessary perspective to the Board table, ensuring that students are at the forefront of all conversations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This Editorial Board does not oppose teachers, the Montgomery County Education Association (MCEA), or any of the MCPS employee unions. We are extremely grateful to all school staff going above and beyond during the pandemic (read our editorial opposing the increased employee healthcare premium on page B4 of our </span><a href="https://issuu.com/silverchipsonline/docs/output" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">October issue</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">). However, we believe criticism of an institution is not the same as criticism of its individual members and efforts. In fact, that critical lens—especially from a group member, as Harris is both a teacher and union member—is imperative to mitigating complacency and promoting progress.﻿</span></p><h3><strong style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Why Harris</strong></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">We stand by all reasoning provided in the previous Editorial Board’s </span><a href="https://www.silverchips.org/2020/05/lynne-harris-for-board-of-education-at.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">endorsement in the spring</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">, which included Harris’ extensive experience as president of the Montgomery County Council of PTAs, an organization of 45,000 volunteers, and a teacher at Thomas Edison High School of Technology. After Jeanette Dixon (At-Large) concludes her term this year, Judith Docca (District 1) will be the only member of the Board with experience as an MCPS teacher and administrator. Though Dasgupta carries the MCEA’s endorsement, Harris is equipped to bring this necessary perspective to the Board table. “I know what it's like to be a teacher in MCPS now,” she said. “We've certainly had people who have had teaching in their resumes at some point, but nobody that… knows the current teaching reality of our school system.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This Editorial Board believes that both Harris and Dasgupta have very similar policy priorities: They both support the ongoing boundary analysis to help desegregate our schools, plan to prioritize mental health services, and are in favor of expanding the academic enrichment offered through advanced courses and magnet programs to all schools in the county.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Both Harris and Dasgupta raised the topic of trust during our interview, citing general community frustration towards MCPS and the Board of Education due to a lack of transparency in decision making, especially with school reopening plans. This Editorial Board asked both candidates for “their specific game plan, if [elected]… to restore that trust.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Dasgupta emphasized his relationship with MCPS teachers and staff members. “Coming from public policy… the best thing to do is to bring people together, and then get a compromise solution,” he explained. “I'll be better placed to do that because I do have the trust of teachers and staff across the system.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Harris, on the other hand, provided a clear proposal to bolster stakeholder engagement and overall transience. “Every board member needs to be assigned three or four clusters, and it will be expected that they will meet at least quarterly with those clusters,” she said, “not when we're talking operating budget hearings… but on an ongoing basis.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This specific suggestion for amplifying community voices is consistent with Harris’ student-centric platform. At every juncture, Harris expresses her commitment to increasing student perspectives in Board discussions. In a personal column published in Silver Chips in October, Harris wrote, “The daily lived experience of our students in our schools should inform every decision we make for pragmatic reasons—because students know things that no one else knows.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33100"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">We wholeheartedly agree. And yet, there is only one Board seat that students, most of whom are under 18, can vote for. Youth advocacy is often concentrated in white and wealthy parts of our county. Students rarely testify at Board meetings. Nonetheless, it is because of former Student Members of the Board of Education (SMOBs) that MCPS initiated the aforementioned boundary analysis, started a systemwide anti-racist audit, and dedicated more funding to counselors and mental health services.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Student voices consistently drive progress, and Harris understands this. Her concrete proposals to increase student engagement, like </span><a href="https://www.lynne4students.org/issues" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">assigning clusters to Board members and requiring at least two parent-teacher conferences to be held in transit-accessible locations</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">, give this Editorial Board confidence that she will go out of her way to meet students’ needs—even if that entails run-ins with employee unions. Her “willingness to immediately and unequivocally call out those at fault,” as the previous Editorial Board wrote in the spring, is a strength, not a weakness.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A glaring flaw</strong></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Neither candidate is perfect. This Editorial Board strongly disagrees with both candidates’ stances on mandatory reporting in cases of sexual misconduct. According to MCPS policy, any criminal charges, such as sexual assault, must be reported to the police department’s Special Victims Investigative Division.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This Editorial Board understands that MCPS employees are under a legal obligation, but we feel strongly that involving the police without the survivor’s input or consent is an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. Police interaction is often uncomfortable and threatening to students—especially for students of color, due to the implicit racism entwined with law enforcement. Forcing referral to the police exacerbates existing discomfort with the reporting process and makes it even more unsafe.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">That legal obligation is problematic; however, both candidates morally support mandatory reporting.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Moreover, neither candidate’s perspective captured the nuance of the legal protocols surrounding reports of sexual misconduct. Dasgupta said “any criminal allegation” must be reported to the police. It was unclear, however, what he meant by “criminal” and if he was referring to the legal definition of a misdemeanor or felony or a more colloquial definition of assault. If he was referring to that formal standard, we see the bar for sexual misconduct to be considered a misdemeanor in Maryland, let alone a felony, as absurdly high.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">While this Editorial Board strongly opposes mandatory reporting, we feel that the inconsistency between Dasgupta’s apparent support for police involvement and the high bar needed for a “criminal allegation” demonstrates that he lacks understanding of the complexities of the system. Yes, the system is convoluted, but as a potential Board member, it is his responsibility to seek out the information to understand the problems in the county.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Harris, too, had a flawed understanding of the situation. “All we do is get that student to a safe, secure, calm place, make the report, and let the experts take over,” she said. This, however, seems to show an abdication of responsibility as a school district. The “experts”—the police—should not automatically “take over” every case; rather, MCPS schools should follow the wishes of each survivor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">However, Harris did express commitment to increasing transparency. “We need to make sure that any student who speaks knows that there is a process,” she said, “and that we are not in this place [where] a student speaks and either nothing happens or they're told something happened but they can see no evidence of it, which is the same as nothing happening.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">We appreciate Harris’ recognition of the uncertainty involved in the reporting process, specifically the lack of follow-up that many students experience. “[We must] partner with students to figure out what mechanisms we can employ that students would find value in and… actually utilize,” she furthered.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">In response, Dasgupta raised concerns over what the school system actually does with student opinions. He described a conversation with a student, in which they asked, “Why are you putting the responsibility of figuring out what to do on us? It is your responsibility as adults to figure out the reporting system and then make sure it works.”&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33101"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As an Editorial Board composed partially of students who have firsthand experience with the system’s ambiguity, we wholly concur. But neither Dasgupta nor Harris discussed alternative approaches that would better reflect survivors’ needs, reflecting a disappointing lack of consideration for students’ rightful mistrust of the reporting process.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">We need greater student involvement. We need our policymakers to actively engage with us and seek our perspectives because the processes and policies on paper rarely match what we actually experience in school buildings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This Editorial Board hopes that, given her focus on students’ self-described needs, Harris will, with further research and discussion, come to understand the flaws ingrained in this broken system. We also believe that she is more likely to work with students—not just frequent activists, but students from diverse clusters and backgrounds—to develop trauma-informed support programs and solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Harris is also endorsed by The Washington Post Editorial Board, County Executive Marc Elrich, countywide youth advocacy organization MoCo4Change and multiple student groups, former SMOBs Nathaniel Tinbite (2019-20), Ananya Tadikonda (2018-19), Matthew Post (2017-18), Eric Guerci (2015-17), and Sebastian Johnson (2005-06), several County Council members, and former Superintendent Joshua Starr.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">For more information on both candidates, visit their websites: </em><a href="https://www.lynne4students.org/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>Lynne Harris</em></a><em style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"> and </em><a href="https://www.sunildasgupta.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>Sunil Dasgupta</em></a><em style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Silver Chips Editorial Board is composed of Editors-in-Chief Anika Seth, Renata Muñoz, Tony González, and Oliver Goldman; Managing Opinions Editors Aviva Bechky and Clark Zhang; and Ombudsman Kathryn LaLonde.

32708	How the club helps people find ways to make connections in the STEM field	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This year, several Blazers created a new National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) chapter. Club members were surprised the school did not have one and took the initiative to spearhead the development of the club. "We were kind of shocked that Blair didn't really have a NSBE chapter, so we thought it would be a great idea to start one here," senior club president Liam Olagbaju says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Club members got inspired to start up the club over the past summer. "We got the idea from when we went on a NASA trip with our summer program at UMD and we decided we wanted to start the program here at Blair for other people interested in engineering," senior vice president Karla Press-Porter says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32707"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NSBE is a national organization that focuses on helping people of color become successful in engineering by creating a greater support system to encourage those entering the field. Most of the organization is at the college level, but there are junior chapters for high schoolers, like the one at Blair. Club members officially registered Blair's NSBE chapter a few months before school started.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NASA aerospace engineer Sheri Horn helped as a club sponsor with the creation of the chapter. Horn also works with the Takoma Academy NSBE chapter and helped the Blazers plan lessons and get guest speakers. "She would help us set up the club on the NSBE website and get us registered, give us ideas for meetings on what we need to do this activity or give a list of like future activities we can do and introduce speakers who are interested in coming," Olagbaju says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Club teacher sponsor James Demma decided to sponsor the club based on the club members' passion for NSBE and the message the students wanted to send. "A couple of my best students asked me to and I had to say yes because they are incredible students with a lot of initiative and motivation and why would I not support that," Demma says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The club meets every Thursday in room 352. Each week, the club does activities such as simulating oil spills, creating structures out of toothpicks and marshmallows and dealing with dry ice. In meetings, students typically split up into groups to conduct these respective projects to find the most efficient way to solve the problem and share their findings with the club.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NSBE also has a large focus on career skills, internships and opportunities for club members. There are workshops and guest speakers to help out with this goal, and the club uses Google Classroom to post information on internship opportunities and other STEM-related events. "Our school sponsor, Mr. Demma, puts different activities or events in the Google Classroom and tells everyone about opportunities that he sees as a teacher to show to students," Olagbaju says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In NSBE, both at Blair and nationally, networking is a crucial part of the organization’s goal to help people of color find opportunities. Blair's NSBE chapter does this by exposing members to all different types of opportunities. "[Officers] talk about how they're getting us ready for internship experiences with field trips and exposing this to all these different people to really help the members," senior club member Zolani Grady says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Olagbaju wants to help students who otherwise might not be interested in engineering to find something worthwhile in the field through NSBE. "A lot of people are intimidated by engineering because they don't see that many people that look like them or they don't know that much about engineering, and we want to get them interested in all types of engineering," Olagbaju says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">NSBE is hoping to get more funding in the future to go to the national NSBE convention. Senior club member Nate Kelkay has previously attended the convention and understands the experience can be. "There are different workshops where you can ask about leadership and about future careers in engineering and that was a great experience," Kelkay says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Club members want all Blair students to be welcome to the club, regardless of race. "You don't have to be black to get into the club. If you're interested in engineering and you actually have a real passion about it, you're welcome here anytime," Olagbaju says. NSBE members also think that a more diverse club population will help with becoming a more critical thinker. "Diversity is important because it gets you thinking outside your thinking box, so you're able to think critically about your own opinions and come up with better solutions and answers," Kelkay says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blazers want students of color to feel more comfortable exploring their interests in STEM in a community with supportive people. "It's like building confidence. When you walk in a room and you see people that have the same interest as you and look like you, you think there are other people like me that are interested in this type of stuff, and that really will help motivate you," Olagbaju says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The current club members hope that the Blair chapter stays successful enough to one day come back to Blair and help the club that gave them their start. "I hope that future generations will carry the club on, so when we're in college, we can come back and share what we've learned to give back what we've gained from the club," Olagbaju says.</span></p>	32707
31556	I follow three Blazers as they describe their experiences in local restaurants	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Soft jazz and laughter fill the room as Emma Bardsen welcomes customers into Republic, an upscale American restaurant in Takoma Park. An embarrassed mother approaches Bardsen. Her </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">son has spilled a little bit of soap in the bathroom. But as Bardsen recalls,&nbsp;the “small” spill wasn't so small. “I go in there and her child had hulked this glass bottle of soap all over the floor, and there's soap and glass everywhere,” Bardsen tells me. Moments later, she hears a crash from the dining area. A bowl of soup has been overturned. The culprit is none other than the same boy who spilled the soap. Wondering who cleans up messes like these? Yeah, you're right; it's Bardsen. Welcome to the life of a hostess.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From an outsider’s perspective, being a hostess at a restaurant may sound like a walk in the park: greeting customers at the door, escorting them to a table, and occasionally helping out with serving. Appearances can be deceiving.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rude and entitled customers. Expectations to meet. Juggling school with work. Student hosts have so much to deal with and still face more challenges with customers. “I’ve had people yell at me, because they didn’t get the table they wanted or get pissed-off because of the wait,” Bardsen recalls. Like Bardsen, Willa Falvey from Republic and Sophia Leonessa from Trattoria da Lina have experienced similar situations.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31555"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">All three Blazers are rookies in the restaurant business, and they all report that older people often overestimate their maturity and ability. In general, younger hostesses don’t know the fine details of restaurant etiquette such as seating arrangements, how each dish on the menu is prepared and how to ensure customers feel they are being attended to. “Our coworkers need to realize that we are still 16 and that we are still learning how to work a job,” Falvey exclaims.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On school nights, Bardsen works for at least 6 hours straight, which leaves hardly anytime to study. “A challenge for me is doing homework after work... I get back home at 10 which leaves me barely enough time to get work done before I go to sleep,” Bardsen explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Applying for jobs in Takoma Park isn’t as hard as one might think. Bardsen, Falvey and Leonessa all report that the application process was initially hard but well worth the effort. Falvey and Bardsen applied to multiple restaurants around Takoma Park, including Starbucks, Busboys and Poets and Republic. Republic was the only one to respond. According to Falvey, the interview itself was a breeze. “The interview was really lowkey and only asked us about our availability,” Falvey says. As for Leonessa, she got lucky because she is a native Italian speaker. “I met the [owner of </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Trattoria da Lina</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">] in the gelato place, and I heard him speaking Italian, so I started speaking Italian with him… I asked him if he had positions, and at first he said no but ended up getting my number from my friend and hired me,” she recalls.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When they finally got their new jobs, all three reported that the restaurant business community is warm and welcoming. Staff look out for each other, help each other out and often joke around. “We [Falvey and Bardsen] are the only people under 18, so there's been a running joke that we don't know anything, which can get pretty annoying but also funny,” Falvey notes. As for Trattoria da Lina, Leonessa has fond recollections. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I love the people and atmosphere. They are really funny, positive and great to be around,” Leonessa describes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For "job-seeking" Blazers in Old Town Takoma, working at a restaurant as a hostess is a good place to start. In fact, that’s one of the only places to start if under the age of 18. Here, Blazers can look to Bardsen, Leonessa and Falvey as role models for stepping into the adult world.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Working in the restaurant business is hard work and requires endurance, but it gives teenagers work experience and prepares them for life in the professional world. Work is often not what you expect it to be. Things can go wrong, people can get frustrated and sometimes you don’t know exactly what you’re doing. Nonetheless, it’s worth knowing how to navigate the hurdles of the adult workplace early on in life.</span></p>	31555
32537	A new proposal drives for safety and general behind-the-wheel instruction	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Dec. 3, the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) Board of Education passed a driver’s education proposal presented by the student member of the board (SMOB), Nate Tinbite. The SMOB’s second successful resolution pushes Superintendent Jack R. Smith to explore partnerships with companies for the implementation of driver’s education classes in MCPS schools.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32536"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Offering driver’s education is not foreign to MCPS — in the mid-1990s, drivers-ed was part of the county curriculum allowing students to meet Maryland’s driver’s license requirements. “Montgomery County used to offer this crucial life skill, and the state requires driver’s education to acquire a license. [Through my proposal] the school system can go back to its roots,” Tinbite said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Dr. John Davis, physics teacher at Blair, took driver’s education when it was available in MCPS, but one of his daughters took the course through the current system outside of school. “From that experience for family, it was much better the way I took driver’s-ed.” he explained.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Without an in-school system, students looking to obtain a driver’s license must take costly driver’s education classes from private companies such as. This is problematic for those who cannot afford it. “This movement is most important to our impoverished students,” Tinbite said. “Driver’s ed costs hundreds of dollars elsewhere and this is a big economic disparity.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With the passage of his resolution, Tinbite wants to develop a driver’s education system that also addresses pedestrian safety. This would be extending the course past the standard requirements set by Maryland to address the prevalent issue of accidents on the road.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Through the new curriculum, Tinbite hopes to remind students about the prevalent dangers of carelessness on the roads. “Recent countywide incidents are alarming. They are so frequent and need to be addressed in schools,” Tinbite said. “I want to educate on the impacts of negligence.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With the MCPS budget season’s conclusion approaching, Tinbite aims to gather opinions about his resolution and student issues. “The budget can be one of the most important votes that I can take during this term. I want to push the issues that students have,” he stated.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Tinbite plans to visit schools to speak with students looking to incite change across MCPS operations and give recommendations for changes to be made around the county. “Right now I hope to start going into schools and collect student feedback on budget priorities. My current priority is to get these set before we push the budget to the board,” he said.</span></p>	32536

32974	Is dressing up in tights really the most effective way to keep Gotham City safe?	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As Americans all over the nation re-evaluate the role of police following the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless other innocent Black people, the justification of the existence of Batman must also be examined, a character who at times embodies the worst of American policing. This is because Batman is essentially a police officer with even more funds and even more aggression.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Batman treats Gotham as his personal playground, hunting down criminals and escapees from Arkham Asylum, only to punish them with savage brutality, treating each lawbreaker that crosses his path like a personal punching bag. While he does not kill, this type of violence is sure to breed years of mental and physical trauma within his victims.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, The Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) is also so corrupt and incompetent that it breeds the need for a vigilante to bring order back to the city, that vigilante being Batman. The Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) is notoriously corrupt, perhaps best illustrated in the graphic novel“Batman: Year One” by Frank Miller, David Mazzucchelli and Richmond Lewis. The GCPD spends its resources protecting organized crime like Carmine Falcone, aiding the persistent drug trade assaulting the communities they have been hired to protect.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yet just because Batman is the response to a corrupt police force doesn’t mean the existence of Batman is in the people’s best interest. While having more police officers is a common method used to decrease crime in certain areas, a former NYPD official-turned police consultant named James McCabe </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/02/13/marshall-project-more-cops-dont-mean-less-crime-experts-say/2818056002/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">told USA Today</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> that to drive down crime rates, “It’s not [the number of officers] you have, it’s what you are doing with them,” McCabe said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only is Batman over policing Gotham, he is doing so ineffectively. Regardless of how many punches he throws, crime in Gotham does not go down. Arguably, Batman’s insistence on this physical style of crime fighting enables crime to persist, rather than be attacked at its core. In this same way, American policing is also ineffective.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, if modern policing isn’t good for America, then Batman isn’t good for Gotham.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The question becomes, what </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">can</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Batman do?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The answer is very little. Batman has established himself as a symbol of fear, not hope, and as a harbinger of vengeance, not justice. However, Bruce Wayne could do a lot to help Gotham City.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32973"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As America reckons over the current state of police in this country, people everywhere are wondering what alternatives are there to modern policing. Luckily, there are several popular theories that could work just as well in Gotham as in America, particularly if Bruce Wayne is involved.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One of the popular cries from protesters across the country is to defund the police and redirect those funds into community programs. In Batman’s case, it would mean redirecting the money billionaire Bruce Wayne uses to dress up like a bat away from crime fighting and towards programs led by citizens of Gotham who have a better grasp of what goes on in their city.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bruce Wayne could donate a significant amount of </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicetruong/2012/07/17/calculating-bruce-waynes-worth-and-the-cost-to-become-batman/#784634bc264e" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">his estimated $11.6 billion net worth</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to find a way to help his city in a nonviolent fashion. For example, he could work to end homelessnes in Gotham. </span><a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/nyc-mayor-vows-to-end-homelessness-as-we-know-it/2243844/#:~:text=Because%20many%20of%20the%20street,million%20in%20fiscal%20year%202021." target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio’s 2019 plan to end homelessness in NYC was estimated to cost 100 million dollars in fiscal year 2021</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. If costs were similar in Gotham, Wayne could spend less than 1% of his net worth to end homelessness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">He could also donate money to various programs in Gotham and help create new ones. If he’s willing to risk his life and dress up like a bat, he should be willing to help his city in nonviolent ways also. Such programs currently exist all over the world, such as </span><a href="https://cvg.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Cure Violence Global (CVG).</a></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">CVG attempts to stop future violence by utilizing the Cure Violence model. This model dates back to 2000, when Cure Violence’s founder Dr. Gary Slutkin, M.D., created it to be initially used in Chicago’s West Garfield Park. For the next 8 years, Cure Violence operated in the United States until 2008 when it began spreading the model to other parts of the world.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Cure Violence model identifies those at the highest risk of engaging in future violent conflicts, and works with the community to solve conflicts and treat people who are at risk. These types of methods appear to work. In 2017, the </span><a href="https://1vp6u534z5kr2qmr0w11t7ub-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019_09_20_CV_Evidence_Table.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Cure Violence model led to a 63% decrease in shootings in New York City and a 30% decrease in shootings in Philadelphia.</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only could this type of organization decrease violence in Gotham City, it could also be more beneficial to the citizens of Gotham in the long run, as it relies on building relationships with communities. Batman, however, has no such reliance, and through his actions destroys any hope he has of building such a relationship.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Protesters all over the country are also calling for police funding to be redirected into mental health services for people. Using Bruce Wayne’s money to ensure more citizens of Gotham had access to adequate mental health resources would also prove extremely beneficial to Gotham City.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In 2019’s “Joker,” Arthur Fleck is a mentally ill man living in extreme poverty in a 1980s Gotham City. One of the events which sets Fleck on his path to becoming the Joker is that funding for social services is cut and he can no longer see his therapist. Arguably, if Fleck had access to proper mental health resources, he may not have become the Joker, the most constant threat to Gotham City and thorn in Batman’s side.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, the Joker is an extreme case. The majority of patients with mental illness won’t become Jokers, or any kind of super-criminal, but that doesn’t mean that throwing them in prison is an effective solution (or Arkham Asylum, in Batman’s case). </span><a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mhppji.pdf" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">In a study done by the Bureau of Justice Statistics halfway through 2005</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, 56% of state prisoners, 45% of federal prisoners and 64% of jail inmates had a mental health issue. Therefore, Batman’s violent approach to criminals isn’t effective at helping people or Gotham, but just adds more trauma. Instead, Bruce Wayne could use his wealth to help fund or create programs like </span><a href="https://whitebirdclinic.org/cahoots/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets (CAHOOTS).</a></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">CAHOOTS operates in Springfield and Eugene, Oregon. It uses experienced medics and crisis workers to help people struggling with substance abuse and mental health issues. Instead of punishing people and throwing them in jail for these struggles, CAHOOTS helps them stay out of jail and get help: an approach that would overall make Gotham better for all of its people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Batman is a deeply complex character, which has contributed heavily to his strong presence in American culture. But, to call him a hero isn’t accurate. Rather than overcome the evil in his city and attempt to bring out its deeply buried good, he decides to become a monster, to rid his city of fear and violence by embodying fear and violence. While Batman may not be killing people, can he still be considered a “good guy?”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If Batman cannot figure out a better way to help Gotham while in the tights, it may be better to put them away. He should consider embracing his other half, Bruce Wayne. In the modern age, he may have the power to do far more good through philanthropic efforts than Batman ever could.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32973
32485	Blair's robotics team holds annual Bunny Bots event to bring teams together in the Chesapeake area	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bunnies fly through the air from canons and slingshots as the whirring of hand drills reverberates through the repurposed gymnasium. The basketball court is now an arena occupied by hundreds of neon green wiffle balls and other game pieces, while 15 repair stations replace half of the bleachers. The audience waits in anticipation as players prepare to shoot balls into baskets, but these players aren't human. Rather, they're made of metal and polycarbonate.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32484"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Sat., Dec. 14, The Blair Robot Project hosted the second annual Bunny Bots competition in Blair's gymnasium. This year's game, "Flying Bunnies," involved building a robot that could collect wiffle balls and bunnies and shoot them into goals of different heights. 15 robotics teams from across the Chesapeake region gathered in the gymnasium with completed robots to participate in the event.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In each match, two robots form an alliance on either side of the arena. The game begins with an autonomous period where the robot must complete tasks without any human interference. Team members then use game controllers to move their robot and collect balls to shoot into three goals on their designated side of the arena. During the endgame, the robots battle to fit into a square in the center of the field to earn additional points for their alliance.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32483"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair Robot Project participates in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) each year, sponsored by the non-profit For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST). Senior Nate Klein, this year's robotics president, explains the mindset behind participating in worldwide robotics competitions. "Through the FIRST Robotics Competition, we want to teach and learn about engineering - all the technical and nontechnical aspects of it. The main goal is to learn," Klein says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To prepare for the annual competition, the robotics team decided to host a smaller event called Bunny Bots at the beginning of the year to teach new members, affectionately called "rookies," how to plan, build, and compete in a robotics event. "We use it to train new members- it's just a fun way to introduce robotics to the new members and it gives them good experience that's useful during the actual season," Klein says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair's robotics team is divided into four subteams: Mechanics, Programming, Electronics and Business. The leaders and older members of each subteam purposefully step back during Bunny Bots season and let the rookies figure out how to build a functioning robot together, only stepping in to assist and give advice. "We did it as a mock build season. The older members were a lot more hands off in the design process, so the newer leaders could learn how to design and lead and the younger members could learn more about how to machine," Klein says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To prepare for Bunny Bots, the team begins by discussing the game manual and determining which game strategy to focus on. Then, the subteams further divide into working on specific mechanisms. Blair’s robot, named Claude, has the following components: bunny gun, agitator and drive, intake and shooter. Intake is in charge of picking up balls off the ground and putting them into the robot. The agitator, which acted like a revolving door, rotates and guides balls into the shooter, which would shoot balls out of the robot into the goals. The bunny gun is a cannon-like mechanism that shoots a stuffed bunny into one of the goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During the actual competition, each team has four members to control the robot itself, called the Drive Team. Blair had multiple Drive Teams composed of rookies, with freshman Andrew Szabo as one of the rookie coaches who determined strategy and guided the rest of the team. "On the day of the competition I was stressed about where I was going to mess up coaching or tell the drivers to do the wrong thing, [but] it was nice being up there with the robot, trying to figure out what we could do," Szabo says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though the mechanisms all came together at the event itself, Claude failed to complete necessary tasks because of the time crunch the team faced. The team struggled to meet the deadlines they had put in place before build season, leaving Programming with little time to finalize the code that enabled mechanisms to execute their given tasks. "For our team as a whole, we can work on planning and actually meeting deadlines, and not finishing anything two weeks late… We didn't quite give Programming enough time," Szabo says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Klein confirms that the team would focus and improve their time management for this year's FRC challenge. "We're going to debrief what went wrong, and make sure we find the balance between letting the rookies and the new leaders work and intervening a little to show them the ropes," he says. Regardless of the technical difficulties at Bunny Bots, the rookies maintained a positive attitude throughout the competition. "I was proud that we did get something on the field… but Bunny Bots should continue happening because it's a great way to learn so I'm ready for build season; I feel helpful to the team," Szabo says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Klein emphasizes the importance of Bunny Bots as the first competition of its kind in the Chesapeake area. It is the only competition in the district that requires teams to build a robot from scratch and play in an environment similar to the global FIRST competition. "I hope Bunny Bots becomes a Chesapeake staple and represents the Chesapeake region's growth as much as the team's growth as well. Our role in the Chesapeake has been growing over the years, and this is a symbol of that," Klein says. </span></p>	32484
33307	Teachers, alumni, and friends reflect on the 25-year-old’s legacy	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Dec. 31, Blair alumnus and Takoma Park resident Thomas “Tommy” Raskin passed away after a long battle with depression. Raskin, 25, graduated from Blair in 2013 and Amherst College in 2017 and was a second-year student at Harvard Law School.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Members of the Blair community say Raskin was a strong pillar of empathy while at Blair and left behind a legacy of compassion, intellect, and humility after graduation.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“He was really compassionate,” Raskin’s longtime friend Tom Agger said. “He had an immense amount of empathy for others… [It was] sort of inspiring for someone our age to just feel for everyone around them.”&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33308"></div><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair- and community-based organizations</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While at Blair, Raskin’s empathy translated into heavy involvement in school and community organizations. He co-founded Blair Leaders Intern for Student Success (BLISS), Blair’s bilingual tutoring program, in 2011 along with current assistant principal Dirk Cauley.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Tommy went on a campaign and went to all of the classrooms to recruit,” Cauley recalled. “We had close to 100 students volunteer to support students in all of the different areas from science, math, social studies, to English and special needs.” Cauley extensively detailed Raskin’s perseverance and commitment to uplifting his peers, citing these traits as primary drivers of the organization’s success.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After BLISS was established, Raskin contributed a portion of his own scholarship money to the organization. “One of the first scholarships that Tommy received, he donated all the proceeds he got to the program [BLISS] so that we could buy T-shirts for all the participants, celebrate the tutors, provide food in our meetings, and buy [graduation] tassels for the BLISS tutors,” Cauley said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition to BLISS, Raskin was also a leader of the Jewish Culture Club along with Josh Schmidt, a peer of Raskin’s who also graduated from Blair in 2013. Schmidt said he and Raskin had been close friends since elementary school and described Raskin’s deep attachment to his faith. “We were co-presidents of the Jewish Culture Club, which was a really great time,” he said. “It was, I know, important for me… just to publicly embrace your Judaism,” he said. “[To] be proud of it. And he [Tommy] was always proud.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Raskin’s immense heart for justice and eliminating inequality extended to the speeches he wrote for the Forensics club, which he captained from his sophomore to senior years. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Tommy always won a trophy in his event,” Margery Scanlan, the Blair Forensics coach from 2010-2020, said. “Many competitors are intimidated by Extemporaneous Speaking because it requires strong general knowledge and analytical skills. Tommy was well informed and carried newspapers and magazines with him to cite facts.&nbsp;He had the ability to construct a logical response with clarity and often a touch of humor.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33309"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During the school day</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Raskin’s speeches for Forensics often also found their way into different classes. CAP Seminar teacher Kevin Shindel recalled one of Tommy’s poems he still uses as an in-class example to this day. “He performed a poem called ‘The Word Game’ he wrote for my class in Forensics and won a number of awards.&nbsp;It discussed how we can differentiate overt types of racist speech versus more systematic institutional forms of racism. And this was in 2013, when not many, or not enough, people were familiar with systematic racism,” Shindel recalled.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Also inside of the classroom, CAP Honors English 9 teacher Dana Simel remembered Tommy as somebody who continuously blurred the line between teacher and student.&nbsp;“Once [Tommy] got on a roll, he and I forgot that he was the student and I was the teacher,” Simel said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Simel specifically described a class discussion regarding philosopher Henry David Thoreau’s theories of self-sufficiency and self-righteous behavior. “We were reading Henry David Thoreau and the portion called economy. Thoreau writes in a [manner] which turns many students off, but Tommy was able to extrapolate ideas, even through the hubris,” Simel said. “After everyone left the class, I would look at [my composition assistant] and smile like ‘Oh my gosh, really Tommy?’ He was just that wonderful.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33310"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Raskin wasn’t afraid to ask the hard questions, whether that be with his peers or teachers. Schmidt, another leader of the Jewish Culture Club, admired Raskin’s ability to facilitate deep discussions in both extracurricular and classroom settings, never plagued by cynicism or fatigue. “The teachers all loved him. The students all loved him. Tommy pushed you, and he pushed everyone. He asked [the] hard questions that maybe you weren't prepared to think about or didn't want to think about. There was just so much, and a favorite topic of his was the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Schmidt said.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Compassion and humility</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Tommy was remembered by teachers and students as the person who always had his arm around someone who was being bullied at home or at school. Daniel Leventhal, who had known Raskin since they were three and graduated from Blair with him, described his innate sense of compassion. “He really did just care for others as a general principle,” Leventhal said. “Tommy was very much an advocate for peace, and I could tell that it came from a place none-other than his heart.”</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33311"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Shindel remembered Raskin as always being conscious of his place in the world, and his compassion and his achievements never superseded his humility.&nbsp;“He was very aware of his privilege and never looked down on other people because they lacked his kind of resources and lacked his upbringing,” he said. “That's where his greatness began, because Tommy was always the most humble person in the room.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“His spirit was so grand, angelic—when you think about it, sometimes not even of this world,” Leventhal said.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Unspoken presence&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Both Raskin’s peers and teachers said that while Raskin was deservedly celebrated for his compassion, there was another personal and witty side to him, too. “It's easy to talk about his achievements, but that's not all he was,” Agger—one of his longtime friends—said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Schmidt echoed this sentiment with memories transcending Raskin’s accolades. “We watched a bunch of Bachelor episodes in his attic one time. We watched stupid Netflix movies,” he said. “I remember when Donovan McNabb was traded to the Washington Football Team. I was in his attic, and I remember exactly where I was. And it's just those little things,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">His friends also said Raskin could light up the whole room with his booming laughter, particularly when around his sisters, Hannah and Tabitha. “His laughter was absolutely contagious, especially with his sisters. If him and his sisters were in the room, he would start laughing, and they would burst out laughing, and there was just no stopping them,” Agger said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33312"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Agger specifically recalled a summer working as a cashier at a Cape Cod supermarket along with Raskin. He said his close friend’s mission was to make every customer smile. “[He would do] everything he could to try to cheer up somber customers that would waddle through that grocery store…He would do card tricks and tell jokes to these customers as they were checking out.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Though this irritated their bosses by slowing down customers, Agger said Raskin never prioritized profit. “How fast business went was none of Tommy’s concern. [He just wanted] to make sure people were happy, which I thought was really amazing,” Agger said. “It made my time working there more enjoyable too.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Memorial Fund</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following his passing, the Raskin family announced a memorial fund in Tommy Raskin’s name on Jan. 2, called the “Tommy Raskin Memorial Fund for People and Animals.” The fund will donate money to charities that Tommy Raskin supported and championed, such as the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults and a Washington, D.C.-based animal advocacy nonprofit called Animal Outlook.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Leventhal feels that Tommy Raskin is aptly remembered by a line from Psalm 120: “</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 19, 32);">I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.”</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To donate to Tommy Raskin’s memorial fund, go to: </em><a href="https://cfncr.wufoo.com/forms/tommy-raskin-memorial-fund-for-people-and-animals" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"><em>https://cfncr.wufoo.com/forms/tommy-raskin-memorial-fund-for-people-and-animals</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sucide Prevention:</em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or locally call the Maryland Youth Crisis Hotline at&nbsp;800-422-0009 for emotional support.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This piece is a collaborative effort between Silver Chips Online and Silver Chips Print.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33308
31544	Staff and students evacuate outside amid the snow	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Staff and students evacuated the building near the end of third period on Wednesday, Jan. 16. Around 15 minutes later, students were allowed to return to the school after building services determined that a staff member's burnt popcorn set off the smoke detector. "It was a very quick turnaround, we were cleared to come back super quickly," assistant principal Adriana Burgos-Ojeda said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31543"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During the evacuation, students assembled near the school building to avoid the snow from last weekend's winter storm that covered the fields and track, which is dangerous in the event of a real fire. "We're always trying to get people as far from the building as possible because we don't know what the cause is," Burgos-Ojeda said. Fortunately, Wednesday's evacuation was caused by a minor incident.</span></p>	31543
33634	Blair's new club for music fans won't fall flat	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In one of the first meetings of the new Blair Album Club, members discuss Kendrick Lamar’s album, “Good Kid, M.A.A.d City.” After a brief overview of the contents of the album, founders NuAmen Audena and Aditya Das move into examining specific tracks and the overarching story the album tells. As they move through the tracklist, some members cut in to point out specific details that others may have missed or share their experiences with the music.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to the larger club conversation, some members share their more personal feelings about the album with small groups of friends. The classroom is overflowing with students, some forced to stand or sit on the floor while finishing their lunch.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Toward the end of the meeting, a QR code is displayed on the presentation that Audena and Das used to guide the discussion. Members scan the code to open a Google Form where they can anonymously give the album a score out of ten, as well as share feedback and favorite tracks. While filling out the form, the volume in the room swells as members debate ratings and favorite tracks. Ultimately, the average club rating of the album is 8.5/10.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33633"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In preparation for next week’s meeting, members will listen to “The Dark Side of the Moon,” Pink Floyd’s iconic 1973 album.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Album Club was created by Audena and Das as a space for students to talk about the music they are passionate about. “[With the club,] I just want to emphasize that me and Aditya aren’t experts, but even if you’re not Anthony Fantano you can still learn about and discuss new music,” Audena says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Before they started the club, Audena and Das often talked about the music they were currently listening to with their friends during lunch and figured that other students may want to do the same. To provide them that opportunity, the Blair Album Club was born.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The club works very similarly to a typical book club. Members meet and decide the album they would like to listen to and return the following week to share their thoughts on the music.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Audena and Das hope to cover a wide range of genres, artists and cultures in the music that the club listens to. From modern to oldies, popular to independent, the club wants to cover it all. However, there are some restrictions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“If someone suggests a K-Pop or country album, I would be very reluctant to review it,” Audena says. He’s not completely joking, but Audena concedes that one can find great music in every genre, including K-Pop.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On a more serious note, Audena and Das want the music they review in the club to have some kind of depth. It needs to tell some sort of story, tap into a kind of universal emotion or have influenced a genre somehow. “It has to have something interesting or unique that separates it from others,” Das says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">An example would be “To Pimp A Butterfly,” Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 Grammy-winning album, which tackles themes of depression, police brutality and religion. “I would love to discuss ‘To Pimp A Butterfly.’ The themes on that album and the story [are] just so cohesive,” Audena says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Das would love to introduce some Blazers to Little Simz, a musician and actress whose most recent release “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert,” has received critical acclaim. In addition to the album from Simz, “Charli” by genre-bending pop star Charli XCX is a favorite. “It’s a pop album, but it also has a lot of experimental stuff mixed in... Even with its flaws I think it’s really interesting to discuss,” Das says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If there is any music Blazers are passionate about, members of the club can suggest albums for the club to listen to through the club’s interest form or DM them on Instagram (</span><a href="https://instagram.com/blairalbumclub?utm_medium=copy_link" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">@blairalbumclub</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As well as more popular music, the Album Club is also interested in listening to music by musicians in the Blair community. “I don’t really know of any Blair students who make their own music, but if someone does and wants us to listen to it, they can totally DM us on Instagram and the whole club can listen to it together,” Das says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The purpose of the club is not just to critique music, but to give Blazers a greater appreciation for the music that they may just casually listen to. “I hope the music that we listen to will help students think about music not just in terms of what sounds good but also think about what the artist is trying to say with the music,” Das says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Pari Shrestha, a sophomore and member of the club, notes how popular the club has become. “It’s really cool to see what kind of music people enjoy and also how they enjoy it. It’s also awesome how much it's grown. I think the turnout has literally doubled since our first meeting.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The club intends to be a place where Blair students can share the music that they love, meet new people with similar interests and discover new music. “Me and Aditya aren’t music critics... but we want people to realize that you don’t have to be an expert to talk about music. In music, anything goes, you know? That’s what I want people to take away from our club,” Audena says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair Album Club meets Fridays during lunch in room 261.&nbsp;</span></p>	33633
32144	Students concerned about bias in the dress code and its enforcement	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Albert Einstein High School's new principal, </span><span style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17); background-color: transparent;">Christine Handy, began the 2019-2020 school year by holding assemblies for each grade, where she announced the new student dress code. Students responded by protesting the rules and requesting more relaxed standards. The new dress code is unfair, targets specific groups such as larger women and aims to oppress women and their bodies.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32143"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to Einstein students, the dress code was not further mentioned after the assemblies. When sophomore Lily Barker attempted to get more information about the new dress code, she was met with more questions than answers. “The dress code isn't clear, they don't have any specific rules that I know of. I feel like when I walk the hallways, the staff is looking to dress code me,” Barker says. And she’s right, the code is not published on the Albert Einstein website or the official Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) website. Einstein's </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/einsteinhs/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">student guide to rights and responsibilities</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> links to the basic MCPS dress code guidelines, which do not resemble Handy’s code.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the past, Einstein has followed the standard MCPS dress code guidelines quite loosely, with rare occasions of actual enforcement. The MCPS dress code rules states, “</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">MCPS has no formal dress code. However, children should wear clothing that allows for full participation in the instructional program.” If this is what students find when searching for more information about Einstein's new dress code, how can administration expect students to follow it?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since the dress code has been announced, students have been cited for things as insignificant as wearing a headband. “One of my friends got dress coded because she wore a headband that was covering too much her head. Her midriff was showing at the time, but they only called her out for the headband,” Einstein sophomore Kenall Cox explains. Other students report similar experiences with the vague dress code, and question if the system is biased against specific groups. Einstein sophomore Sophia Hurley comments that she observed inequitable enforcement at school. “Girls who are curvier are getting called out much more than skinnier girls. It's understandable that they are getting very self-conscious if they're the only ones being called out,” says Hurley.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Suspicions of a bias against certain groups do not end there. Einstein sophomore Olivia Lopez noticed that the dress code is not aimed at boys,&nbsp;“I think it's really degrading when [the dress code] isn't enforced onto the boys and then it's the only thing they focus on for girls. It's kind of saying that the boys' education is more important,” Lopez says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students at Blair take a stance on Einstein's dress code as well. Blair junior Alessia Malapi believes that dress codes only make students feel more insecure. “High school students already have enough insecurity as it is; dress codes only make it worse. They tell girls to cover up just to please boys, it's messed up,” Malapi says. Malapi recalls the feeling of when she got dress coded in middle school, “I had to wear this ugly sweatshirt some teacher gave me to cover me up. It made me feel like crap because I really liked what I was wearing that day,”&nbsp;Malapi says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In response to the dress code, Einstein students have organized protests against these new policies, wearing exactly what the dress code attempts to suppress. Multiple students have filed complaints to the office asking that the school administration change the rules.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The student protests should not be taken as an opposition to a dress code, but rather an objection to the inequity of the dress code. “If the school had approached the dress code more clearly and nicely then I think it would have worked,” Barker says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is a great opportunity for the Albert Einstein staff to give their students a voice and allow them to help shape the culture at their school. If the administration listened to their students, they would understand that students do not support a dress code that is strict, bias and unfairly enforced.&nbsp;</span></p>	32143
31652	Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks, the poet	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was an inspirational African American women who certainly deserves recognition as one of the most influential poets of the 50s. Born in Topeka, Kansas in 1917, Brooks was always chasing after her passions to become a poet. Her father, a janitor who dreamed of being a doctor, and her mother, a schoolteacher, and pianist, were always supportive of their daughter's love for reading and writing.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Brooks was only 13 when she published her first poem, "Eventide," and by the time she was 17, her poems were frequently being published in a newspaper serving the African American community of Chicago.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31651"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In 1950, she became the first African American to receive a Pulitzer Prize, for her poetry book "Annie Allen." A beautiful portrait of the life of the black urban poor, this book of poetry combines free verse, sonnets, and other models to portray Brooks’ experiences as a black girl growing into adulthood. She expresses the prejudice she faced not only from white people, but also from lighter-skinned African Americans throughout her works of poetry.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Her ability to interweave her activism into beautiful works of literature and her commitment to her political and cultural identity have made Brooks one of the most influential African American figures of the 1950s. </span></p>	31651
32625	The club hosted regionals event for Maryland on Jan. 11	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Usually you make $9,500 every week and now with this promotion, you were able to make an additional $834 a week. This gave you a profit of about $375 a week, so that was very good for your business,” junior Joseph Zenick says. At the moment, he is not an ordinary high school student. Instead, he is a financial analyst temporarily contracted to Clock House, a retail clock store. Zenick is providing a critical recommendation to the owner about the stores sales and whether they have the capacity to hire an additional employee.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32623"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Zenick was competing in the Business Finance Series event at DECA regionals (encompassing teams from Howard, Anne Arundel, and Montgomery County) and placed third in the category. The </span><a href="https://www.deca.org/about/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">mission</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of DECA, formerly known as the </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Distributive Education Clubs of America, is to “prepare emerging leaders and entrepreneurs for careers in marketing, finance, hospitality and management in high schools and colleges around the globe.” Junior DECA captain Shariar Vaez-Ghaemi describes the unique opportunity DECA provides. “It’s just a great opportunity to get your school more involved in leadership and entrepreneurship, things that don't normally get taught in the classroom,” he says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">There are several different competitive </span><a href="https://www.deca.org/high-school-programs/high-school-competitive-events/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">events</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">, which are based on six career tracks:&nbsp;business management &amp; administration, finance, marketing, entrepreneurship, hospitality &amp; tourism and personal financial literacy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Additionally, there are two components: a 30-minute written exam about common business principles, and an interactive role-play event with an industry professional serving as a judge. The role-play can be done in partners or individually and competitors are given 15 minutes to assume a role after being handed a prompt. They then give a ten-minute presentation and complete a question-and-answer session with the judges, who play the role of business owners.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32624"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This year, Blair DECA hosted Maryland’s regional competition from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Jan. 11. The opening ceremony invited teams from all over the county and was hosted in the student activity center (SAC). Following the welcome speech delivered by senior Alyssa Ma, participants took their 30-minute written marketing exams. Blair DECA also went above and beyond to make the day special by getting motivational speaker Jordan Davis to talk about his experiences with the program as well as by providing dinner for the participants and judges.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Vaez-Ghaemi describes the planning process, which started in November. “We had to contact some local businesses so we could have some more money, just because of the fact that it was only $15 per person. [On Friday], we were up here until 8 p.m., making sure we had all the papers ready, especially having spreadsheets ready for the judges,” Vaez-Ghaemi says. He recognizes that the experience was chaotic, but argues that it was absolutely worth it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Blair DECA takes pride in hosting the regionals event as a second year team. Blair was given the opportunity to hold regionals because of an open position in Maryland leadership which Ma filled. Many schools got pushed into Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), causing the student board to shuffle dramatically. There was no region one vice president, who usually has the responsibility of hosting regionals. Blair nominated Ma and she ran unopposed.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As a whole, DECA has 225000 members, 3775 high school chapters, 300 collegiate chapters, and 5500 advisors. Maryland has one of the smallest chapters; it is less successful than even the Delaware chapter. Some of the most well-known teams are from Richard Montgomery and Walt Whitman. Hosting regionals at Blair was a big step for Blair DECA and increased the team’s recognition.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair DECA advisor Donna Whitney praises Blair DECA leadership for their incredible business skills. “They understand business, they understand public speaking and they know the art of sale. They know how to get things from people. I think what I was very pleased with was how they were able to market out in the community and they got a lot of things, like food and drinks, donated to help us with DECA. It blew me away,” Whitney says. These skills will indubitably be put to use as the team competes at the state championships in February.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Editor's note: Alyssa Ma is one of the business executives for Silver Chips Print.</em></p>	32623
33289	Los cambios y tendencias de los votantes latinxs en las elecciones presidenciales.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDurante esta elección presidencial, se estima que 32 millones de latinxs serán elegibles para votar en los comicios. Los votantes latinxs son un grupo demográfico muy importante y esto ha causado que diferentes campañas presidenciales hagan un esfuerzo para atraerlos.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEn el año 1960, el país estaba siguiendo otra elección histórica: las campañas presidenciales de John F. Kennedy y Richard Nixon. Kennedy y Nixon tuvieron una apretada carrera presidencial, pero como resultado Kennedy ganó, debido en parte a sus esfuerzos con los votantes latinxs. Durante la convención nacional demócrata en 1960, Edward Roybal, un concejal de Los Ángeles, convenció a Kennedy sobre la importancia de atraer votantes latinxs. Roybal argumentaba que esto sería beneficioso si Kennedy quería ganar el apoyo de estados con poblaciones altas de latinxs, como Texas. Entonces Roybal y varios otros líderes latinxs empezaron los clubes Viva Kennedy, donde latinxs podían registrarse para votar y apoyar a Kennedy.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEste movimiento marcó la primera vez que la comunidad latinx fue reconocida por políticos estadounidenses en una escala tan grande y los clubes Viva Kennedy facilitaron el comienzo de varios otros movimientos latinxs.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33288"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Un aspecto único entre los votantes latinxs es que diferentes grupos entre la comunidad latinx votan para diferentes partidos políticos. Esto causa que diferentes estados con una gran cantidad de votantes latinxs voten de maneras distintas. Dr. Mark Hugo López, el director de migración global y demografía en el Pew Research Center, cuenta que “En el caso de Florida, por ejemplo, hay más apoyo para el candidato republicano porque hay una población cubana que se identifican más en el candidato republicano”. Los cubanos tienen una larga historia de votar por candidatos republicanos y son muy influyentes en Florida. En contraste “estados como California o como Nueva York el apoyo para los demócratas es muy fuerte”, dice López</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tEn adición están saliendo datos sobre los venezolanos “que indican que ellos también apoyan a los republicanos en el caso de las elecciones para el presidente”, cuenta López</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLópez añade que en general la comunidad latinx tiende a votar para el candidato demócrata en la elección presidencial. Él dice que esta “culminación del voto latino para los demócratas y los republicanos es casi lo mismo en los muchos de los años durante las dos últimas décadas. Pero es muy interesante, porque en 2004 fue un año cuando el voto latino fue con George Bush, un republicano, con un porcentaje de más de 40 por ciento”.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tDebido al porcentaje de latinxs en algunos estados, el voto latinx en las últimas elecciones ha sido muy importante para ganar ciertos estados. Estados como Florida, un estado clave para la elección, donde 1 en 5 votantes son latinx, ocasiona que la comunidad latinx pueda decidir quien gana los votos electorales del estado. Pero la elección no es totalmente decidida por los latinxs.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAun así, de acuerdo con la oficina del Censo de los Estados Unidos, solo 47.6 por ciento de latinxs votaron en la elección presidencial de 2016. En contraste, el 65.3 por ciento de la población blanca no-hispana votó y 59.6 por ciento de la población afro-americana no hispana votó. De todos modos, la cantidad de ciudadanos latinxs que pueden votar sigue creciendo cada día.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tLa comunidad latinx ha sido muy prominente en la política de este país por años. Con proyecciones del Pew Research Center que indican que los latinxs van a ser la minoría racial y étnica con el porcentaje más grande de votantes, quién sabe qué otros cambios causarán los latinxs en el futuro.</span></p>	33288

The current admins continue to run the account after Bondo's departure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The amount of time Ren invests into the account revolves around Blair's weekly schedule. During </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B25CvHQB5zm/?igshid=14s0bscgfopr2" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Spirit Week</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for example, Ren collected photos from her fellow admins and from student posts that tagged mbhs4. She then decorated and edited her photos to make them aesthetically pleasing.&nbsp;"I poured a good five hours every single day into just posting things because… in my heart I want [the posts] to look nice. I add a bunch of calligraphy and doodles on all the pictures and edit them so the colors are nice," Ren says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a student-run page, Ren's main goal is to not only feature pride and participation, but also to give her fellow students a platform to express their opinions and unite as Blazers. "Recently, I've been trying to get a lot more input from the students with the things on our Story, like 'What are your opinions on the new furniture?' or 'What do you think of OneLunch?'" she says.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32394"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">﻿The mbhs4 admins utilize Instagram stories to encourage student participation, as stories allow for more interactive features. Ren believes that audience interaction is sparse because students would rather not publicly express their opinions by commenting on posts. By posting questions and polls on the mbhs4 Story, students can simply click or slide to their opinion. "It just gives people a more open platform to voice their opinions, and they can do it anonymously so&nbsp;they're more willing to say what they feel," Ren says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The account's student-centered platform distinguishes it from other news organizations active at Blair, as mbhs4 represents raw, unfiltered student opinions. The focus of the account is on its followers rather than the admins, which results in its unceasing growth in popularity.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One major event highlighting the account's capacity for student participation was mbhs4's updates on High School Nation's change in the lineup. "Blair actually came together as a community. I originally just posted that as a joke, I was like 'haha it'd be so funny if we all tagged Silento', and then people actually started doing it, and the </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3a50xzheiK/?igshid=9qirp9h7nqp4" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">real Silento responded</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, which was just insane," Ren says. The account continued to support student voices and post student responses and memes on their story to update on the Silento issue.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though mbhs4 has no official affiliation with Blair, admins like junior Gueslan (Gez) Torontow understand that they have the responsibility of reposting accurate and trustworthy news and maintaining the account's credibility. "We take it as a huge responsibility to be honest, everything we post on that page. The whole school is going to see it, and from time to time [Principal Johnson] will ask us to post a specific promotion or reposts what we post,” he says. Torontow emphasizes that the admins focus on trusting each other to post information that is beneficial to the student body.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">"I like to think that what I'm doing is helping improve our community and unifying it by making sure we have increasing access to information about the school in general," Ren says.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32394
31826	With their latest acquisition of Fox, Disney is now to world's largest entertainment corporation.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It all started with </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Steamboat Willie</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> back in 1928. Who could have guessed that this eight minute film about a cartoon mouse would be the launching point for one of the most recognizable brands in the world? Now, Disney controls </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2018/07/disney-fox-deal-box-office-1201984120/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">40%</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> of the film industry through its merger with Fox, its ownership of the ABC television network and through its various licensing deals. This includes the highly grossing Marvel Cinematic Universe, Emmy award-winning shows such as </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Modern Family</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, and the rights to blockbuster hit </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Avatar</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. This figure does not even account for ESPN, the largest sports television network in the world, which is also owned by the corporation. It's fair to say the Mouse House will be getting a lot of bang for their buck. So how did Disney go from </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Steamboat Willie</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> to a multi-billion dollar media conglomerate?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Just like most successful companies, Disney had humble beginnings. Walt and Roy Disney founded their cartoon company in 1923, working out of a small studio in Los Angeles. </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Steamboat Willie</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> launched them into stardom, kick-starting their success in the animated film industry. From there Disney took off, making many of the animated movies that we know and love today, such as </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Snow White, Cinderella, Bambi, Pinocchio, and Peter Pan</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, to name a few. During the 1940's, films were bleak with the terror of war dominating the world, yet Disney was able to churn out some of the best of the century. Just one extraordinary accomplishment in the company's long history.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31825"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Disney would then go on to form the Disney Music Company, open Disneyland, and even hold four exhibits at the World’s Fair of 1964. The Disney brand grew and by 1971, Walt opened his own theme park: Walt Disney World.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the outside, Disney World appears to have it all. Incredible theme parks, extravagant hotels, and top-rated restaurants. It's any kid’s dream. However, what sometimes goes unnoticed is how the park has turned into a money making machine. According to Forbes Magazine, last year the resort made 2.2 billion dollars, accounting for nearly a third of Disney's overall</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2014/07/14/the-secrets-behind-disneys-2-2-billion-theme-park-profits/#5857b1d1584f" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"> revenue</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Disney's monopolization ventures slightly outside the entertainment realm.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Disney's first big acquisition came in 1996 with the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/01/business/media-business-merger-walt-disney-acquire-abc-19-billion-deal-build-giant-for.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">purchase of the ABC</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and all of its affiliates including ESPN. This first acquisition led to a domino effect where Disney took&nbsp;over struggling brands and gave them the means and opportunity to turn their companies around. At this point in history (early 2000’s) Disney was more than an established brand; it was a household name. The company had released almost </span><a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/distributor/Walt-Disney#tab=year" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">40 feature-length films</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> targeted at families and children, allowing&nbsp;an entire generation to grow up with Disney characters as their heroes. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Then came the high-value acquisitions which capped off&nbsp;Disney's Hollywood takeover. It started with one of the most profitable franchises in film today: Marvel. Disney purchased Marvel Entertainment in December </span><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/08/31/news/companies/disney_marvel/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">2009</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Up next was Lucasfilm, George Lucas's film studio with which he created Star Wars, in 2012. Finally, Disney nabbed 20th Century Fox earlier this year, another studio which has the rights to dozens of major films.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Even as Disney modernizes, becoming an example of how to monopolize an industry, it is difficult to find critics of how Disney conducts itself as a company. Though it seems that Disney is doing a complete take over of Hollywood, there is one thing to remember. Disney's biggest competition is itself. They are on their own in an industry that requires partnership and cooperation. They’ve dug out a hole and are now attempting to fill it with as much content as possible. No one knows how long it will last but it is certain that we will be watching to see what Disney does next.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31825
32590	The gap in academic performance between White and Asian and minority students has not narrowed	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Dec. 3, Montgomery County's Office of Legislative Oversight (OLO) released a </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OLO/Resources/Files/2019%20Reports/OLOReport2019-14.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">report</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> on the achievement gap. It detailed how little progress Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) has made to close the gap since releasing the previous report in 2015.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The report analyzed performance and opportunity gaps based on race, ethnicity and service group status. Service group status refers to students who are eligible for free and reduced price meals (FARMS), English learners (ESOL) or students with disabilities (SPED). The two major findings of the study were that "performance gaps by race, ethnicity and service group status persist" and that "opportunity gaps by race, ethnicity and service group status also persist."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32589"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The achievement gap takes root in elementary schools. The percentages of Asian and White students in grades three through five who met or exceeded the benchmark performance for the Math Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) in 2019 were 79.8 percent and 71.8 percent respectively. Both of these were more than double the percentage of Black students (34.4 percent) and Latinx students (30.1%) who did so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Math PARCC scores for middle schoolers were overall worse, but the drop in the percentage of passing Black students (down to 17.1%) and Latinx students (down to 14.6%) was much more significant than that of White (53.5 percent), Asian (56.0 percent) and multiracial (45.7 percent) students.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This trend was also visible in the percentage of students of each race who met performance benchmarks on both the English and Math sections of the SAT in 2019. White, Asian and multiracial students outperformed minority (Black and Latinx) students by anywhere from 25 to 50 percent on both the Math and English sections.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">FARMS, ESOL and SPED students were similarly disadvantaged as compared to their non-FARMs, non-ESOL and non-SPED peers. The dropout rate among ESOL students (36.3%) was over ten times that of non-ESOL students (3.6%). Additionally, FARMS, ESOL and SPED students all had below average percentages of students meeting PARCC benchmarks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The report also listed what the OLO believes to be the main opportunity gaps. The number one gap was "concentrated poverty among MCPS schools." This has been a highly discussed topic in regard to the county's </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/an-overview-of-the-montgomery-county-public-schools-boundary-analysis-32268/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">boundary analysis</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Junior Mihret Asfaw, a frequent attendee of the boundary analysis discussions, noted that a lack of resources is one aspect of concentrated poverty among schools that contributes to the gap. "A lot of the issue with areas that have higher concentrations of poverty is unequal distribution of resources," she said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The second opportunity gap was the "underfunding of compensatory education and ESOL programs." The report explained that one of the causes of this gap is that in 2019, MCPS disproportionately budgeted money for each service status group. For example, it budgeted $22,900 for special education per student with a disability, as compared to only $1,600-$2,000 for compensatory education per FARMS student and $2,800 for ESOL programs per English learner.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The primary goal of Blair’s Minority Scholars Program (MSP) is to shrink the achievement gap at Blair and across the county. Senior Lauren Lim Chee Yung, a member of MSP and of Blair’s Student Government Association, believes that a lack of funding in poorer schools can be very detrimental to a student’s education. "Schools that don’t have money, it’s more likely for the students to not be as academically inclined, or wanting to achieve more because they’re not being funded," she said. Attempting to redistribute funding more equally across schools could help to close the gap.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Asfaw pointed out that the achievement gaps are not only caused by a lack of equality, but also a lack of equity. "Once the county sits down and we talk about what needs to be done in order to fix it, we can assure that students are starting on the same ground and that each student has equal opportunities to succeed," she said.</span></p>	32589
33635	From Fine Arts Fridays to 50+ student clubs, the activities are as diverse as Blair itself.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The bell for lunch rings, and Blair Boulevard is immediately crowded as students attempt to wade through the throng and find somewhere to enjoy their lunch. Yet as the initial rush dies down, the main hallway begins clearing as students go to club meetings in classrooms or participate in the indoor soccer tournament in the gymnasium. As the largest public school in Maryland and with over 3000 students, Blair's building simply cannot withstand thousands of students eating in the student activity center (SAC) or first floor, even without regarding COVID-19 safety precautions. So where do Blazers go and what do they do?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Starting in the 2019-2020 school year, Blair switched from a two-lunch-period system to a single lunch period, called One Lunch. The shift led to more opportunities for students to seek academic support and attend clubs with fewer concerns over teacher and room availability, but it also required detailed planning to ensure that there was enough space for students to enjoy lunch.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair Lunch Activities, which can be viewed at </span><a href="http://lunch.mbhs.edu" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">lunch.MBHS.edu</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, include everything from movies in the auditorium and Fine Arts Fridays to soccer tournaments in the gym and clubs. Administrator Peter Ostrander explains that for new activities such as Fine Arts Fridays, the Blair lunch activities organizers asked teachers for their ideas. "We asked for department and teacher volunteers who were willing to do anything at lunch to engage students in different ways," Ostrander says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fine Arts Fridays started on Oct. 1 with student-made temporary tattoos on Blair Boulevard with Hispanic Heritage Month inspired designs. Students crowded around the tables set up, excited to receive fun celebratory tattoos made by their peers. Additionally, throughout the month, there will be several Hispanic Heritage Crafts events to commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month. The lunch activity calendar is constantly being updated, and as students and staff settle into the new school year, fine arts teachers will add more activities with their availability. "Soon, I hope to host an activity for students to paint their own masks. And this year, I think we'll see a lot more activities tied to specific celebration months and mindfulness," Armstead-Thomas says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fine arts resource teacher Jacqueline Armstead-Thomas said that she got the idea of Fine Arts Fridays from other county teachers. "I go to countywide teacher meetings where we share best practices or great ideas. With moving to One Lunch and needing a space and place for students to be during lunch, as most students rarely come to the Fine Arts hallway, we [fine arts teachers] wanted to open up our space and provide fun activities," Armstead-Thomas says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair's athletic department is also busy providing sports games. "There is currently an indoor soccer tournament going on, and we hope to have an indoor basketball tournament later on," Ostrander says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In net sports class, students are currently playing volleyball. With the nets already set up in the small gym and balls piled neatly in a large cart on one side, students walk in during lunch for a fun scrimmage with friends. Laughter and words of encouragement fill the gym as students pass a volleyball amongst themselves in a friendly scrimmage. Others use the gym as an opportunity to fine-tune their skills and practice jump serves or serve-receive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With over 50 clubs meeting each week during lunch at Blair, many groups are taking advantage of the opportunity the one-hour long lunch period provides. Junior Aileen Qi, Founder and President of the new Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA) chapter at Blair, explains the convenience of holding clubs during lunch. "Lunch seems to work with everybody's schedule, as many have time commitments and other activities after school. It did not seem feasible to have an after-school meeting that would allow a lot of prospective HOSA members to join," she explains.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With a large population of Blazers and a Blair campus only so large, Blair Lunch engages students all around the school through clubs, sports, the arts, movies, academic support, career assistance, or simply study time. There is something for everyone, especially during lunch, when an hour can seem to last forever.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Check out Blair Lunch's </span><a href="http://lunch.mbhs.edu" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">schedule</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> each week to view an updated calendar of all that Blair offers. Try something new (or familiar): a club, a friendly sports game, a movie, an art event. With such a diverse range of events, there's bound to be something you enjoy.</span></p>	33619
33624	Blair’s defensive players prevent opponents from scoring throughout the game	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33623"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Sept. 30, the Blair Blazers (5-1) clinched another win, defeating rival Northwood Gladiators (4-2) with a score of 3-0. This win marks another game in which Blair’s stellar defense prevented the opponent from scoring any goals.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The first half started slowly as both teams shared possession of the ball for relatively equal amounts of time, and steals were frequent and quick. This also resulted in the majority of the game being played close to the center line. Both teams resorted to strategically kicking the ball past the end and sidelines to keep the ball away from opposing players. 12 minutes into the game, the Blazers’ quick passes near the goal area confused the Gladiators’ defensive players, and sophomore Simone Hargrove, Blair’s striker, scored the first goal of the game.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s utilization of man-to-man marking made goal attempts difficult for the Gladiators. With 25 minutes remaining in the first half, Hargrove made two more goals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the game continued, players on both teams stumbled multiple times, a result of aggressive playing. The Blazers’ speed gave them an edge on the field, making it harder for the Gladiators to play defensively. Senior Gaby Guzman was an exceptional example of this throughout the game, regularly sprinting to bring the ball across the field.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ten minutes remained in the first half, and senior Hannah Tudge attempted to score a goal, but it was blocked by Northwood’s goalkeeper. Junior Zaida Willis commented on the challenges the team was facing in scoring more goals in the first half. “I feel like we weren’t playing as a united team. We were way too predictable,” Willis said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Neither team was able to score during the second half. With seven minutes left in the last half of the game, the Gladiators committed a foul after tripping Tudge, and she was awarded a free-kick by the referee. The attempt was successfully blocked by Northwood’s goalkeeper. Northwood committed a second foul at 3:47 minutes left. Tensions were high at the final minute, and Northwood substituted players twice in a last-ditch attempt to score a goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers ended up winning the game, but the team admitted they did not play their best. Senior Danielle Kashkooli, Blair's goalie, expressed disappointment over their performance. “A win is a win, but we definitely could have worked to have more control over the ball. It feels good, but at the same time we have more work to do,” Kashkooli said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game against the Sherwood Warriors on Monday, Oct. 11 at 7:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33623
32899	Many athletes have responded to the killing of George Floyd by voicing their opinions on social media or even taking to the streets themselves.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The murder of George Floyd has sparked outrage and chaos across the country, with protests on the streets of almost every U.S. city. Many athletes have responded to the killing of George Floyd by voicing their opinions on social media or even taking to the streets themselves.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, this is not the first time athletes have spoken up about social issues in America. One of the earliest known instances of an athlete speaking up about a social issue in the United States was during a </span><a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/athletes-and-activism-the-long-defiant-history-of-sports-protests/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">baseball game in 1883</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, when the Toledo Blue Stockings started Moses Fleetwood Walker, an African American player who was not initially going to play. This was a stance against racism after the other team refused to play the game because he was a person of color. Since then, athletes from Jackie Robinson to Colin Kaepernick have spoken up against social issues, namely racism.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32898"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Speaking up about social issues has never been easy for athletes. Jackie Robinson reluctantly joined the MLB in 1947 to break the color barrier in professional sports. Robinson knew it would not be easy, and was belittled and discriminated against because of his skin color from the second he stepped into the Brooklyn Dodgers’ locker room. In Robinson’s tenure on the team, one of his teammates </span><a href="http://www.thisgreatgame.com/1947-baseball-history.html#:~:text=Alabama%2Dborn%20Dixie%20Walker%2C%20a,in%20front%20of%20the%20team." target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">started a petition</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to remove him. It was unsuccessful. In 1968, track stars Tommie Smith and John Carlos </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-1968-olympics-protest-20180720-htmlstory.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">raised fists</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to draw attention to the way African Americans were being treated. Smith and Carlos were reluctant to raise their fists, and faced backlash after going through with the gesture on the podium. Basketball superstar Lebron James, who has never been shy about voicing his opinions, was told to </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/19/587097707/laura-ingraham-told-lebron-james-to-shutup-and-dribble-he-went-to-the-hoop" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">“shut up and dribble”</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> by Fox News pundit Laura Ingraham after he criticized Donald Trump in a 2018 interview with ESPN.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the difficulties and criticism that comes with speaking up about a social issue, the good it accomplishes outweighs the negative consequences of speaking up. It spreads awareness about the issue. More people felt inspired to challenge the social norms of segregation in 1947 when Jackie Robinson finally broke the color barrier in the MLB. More African American baseball players began to join Jackie Robinson in the MLB, which slowly but surely began to send an anti-segregation message to the rest of America as the most popular sport at the time.

Even though Robinson and Ali had difficult times playing sports, their sacrifices and resilience paid off in the future. Segregation laws no longer exist, and today there are plenty of professional African American athletes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Professional athletes have a big platform in today’s society, thanks to social media and the press. When many NFL players took a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality, the American public knew almost instantly. The players’ actions helped to expand national conversations about police brutality. Players in other leagues began to do the same thing when the national anthem was played. More people are aware of this issue as a result, and pressure is being put on politicians and police officers alike to treat people more equally.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Many people do not want athletes to use their platforms to speak up against social issues because they want sports and politics to stay separated. Anyone who believes this should put themselves in the shoes of any NFL player that has decided to take a knee in the past or has decided to do so this upcoming season in response to the George Floyd murder. The point of a protest is to point as much attention as possible towards an issue, and a sporting event is the biggest setting for athletes to do that. Athletes are tired of seeing people of the same skin color as them, or that of their teammates, oppressed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since racism is still an issue in sports, athletes are still speaking out against it. A noose was discovered in NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace’s garage last month. To stand against the actions, every driver in his next race pushed his car around the race track to show solidarity. In the English Premier League, players wear arm patches that say “Black Lives Matter” in response to the events that have taken place recently.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Athletes have a right to voice their opinions, and they should continue to do so. By using their platforms to their advantage, they spread awareness on social issues and speak up for others who do not have a voice. More people feel empowered to make a change, and that has happened many times in the past and will continue to happen in the future as long as athletes use their power in a positive way.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32898
33233	Cheering on a team or player from the stands at a professional sporting event is an American pastime. However, the dangers of Covid-19 have prevented fans from doing that for most of 2020	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cheering on a team or player from the stands at a professional sporting event is an American pastime. However, the dangers of Covid-19 have prevented fans from doing that for most of 2020. Some stadiums have begun allowing attendance at limited capacity, causing many people to wonder if fans should be allowed at professional sporting events again.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33232"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA) finished their seasons without fans in attendance. Major League Baseball (MLB) played its season without fans but allowed a limited number of fans to attend games in the National League Championship Series and the World Series. A handful of stadiums in the National Football League (NFL) and throughout college football are allowing a limited number of fans to attend games.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Both plans for the NFL and MLB are understandable. If local health officials believe it is safe for those areas, then why not? Capacity is very limited to maintain social distancing. However, there are many pros and cons of allowing fans to attend games right now, and the question has to be approached from many different angles. There is no short answer, because the circumstances are different for each stadium and city.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If any stadium allows attendance, groups need to be seated at least six feet apart and wearing masks. If possible, games should be played outside to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-what-to-do-outside.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">decrease the risk</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of transmission.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Smaller indoor arenas that hold hockey and basketball games pose a greater risk for disease transmission, so it is probably too early to let fans back in. The small capacity of these buildings makes it harder to spread fans out, and the lack of fresh air would prevent the virus from leaving circulation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Larger venues that hold baseball and football games are much safer since they are outside, making it easier to spread people out. The open air environment could better prevent virus circulation. It is probably safe to allow limited capacity attendance at those games in some areas, but not nationwide.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A health risk comes with attending games, but the financial losses that teams and the league would face without fans in stadiums this season would also be significant. For example, the </span><a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/06/23/losses-to-cities-for-nfl-games-without-fans-could-be-staggering/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">NFL</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> estimates it will lose $3 billion as a result of stadiums without fans. One specific example are the losses that </span><a href="https://www.wsaw.com/2020/07/16/hospitality-industry-stands-to-lose-millions-with-no-fans-for-preseason-activities/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Green Bay, WI</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> is expected to face as a result of fans being absent from Lambeau Field. Around $15 million dollars are expected to be lost without fans around for preseason games with likely bigger losses for regular season games. Local economies will suffer tremendously as well. Many bars, restaurants, parking lots, stores and other businesses rely on packed game-day attendance in cities across America. Despite the economic misfortune, health should be the highest priority. Fans should not be allowed in stadiums unless health officials decide it is safe. The decisions for each stadium should be made by local officials. It could be a good incentive for fans to mask up and follow the rules in the meantime.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The deafening roars of crowds in stadiums across America have been missed. However, trusting health officials and following the rules is crucial, as doing so will only make the inevitable return of crowds to stadiums arrive sooner.&nbsp;</span></p>	33232

33212	The second-year quarterback from Ohio State lost his starting spot after Week 4 and was cut after Week 16	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the 2019 NFL Draft, the Washington Football Team drafted Ohio State (OSU) quarterback Dwayne Haskins with the 15th overall pick. This came as a surprise to many because Haskins was projected to be drafted much earlier, as early as a top-3 pick in some mock drafts.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33210"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I, along with many Washington fans were excited about this pick, and for good reason. Haskins was a finalist for the 2018 Heisman Trophy after winning 13 out of 14 games in his senior year at OSU, and totaling 4,831 passing yards and 50 passing touchdowns.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I am a lifelong Washington football fan, so I had a hard time just giving up on our first round quarterback. Haskins had a chance to work behind and learn from Alex Smith, a 15-year NFL quarterback. I thought holding onto him could be a worthwhile investment, but after his abysmal performance, both on and off the field, it became clear we couldn't keep him any longer. Cutting Dwayne Haskins after just two seasons was the right thing to do.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Initially, Haskins was the second-string quarterback behind Case Keenum, who Washington received in a trade from Denver. But in Week 4 of the 2019 season, Keenum was benched in the second quarter and Haskins made his </span><a href="https://www.nfl.com/games/redskins-at-giants-2019-reg-4" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">first regular season appearance</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, in which he threw for a lackluster 107 yards and three interceptions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Haskins never bounced back from his first poor performance. In total for the 2019 season, he started seven of his nine appearances (winning just one), throwing for 1,365 yards, seven touchdowns, and seven interceptions. Haskins also fumbled six times, losing two of them.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Over the summer heading into the 2020 season, Haskins showed off his </span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/dwayne-haskins-debuts-slimmer-body-on-social-media-and-why-it-could-have-an-impact-on-redskins-in-2020/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">summer grind</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> on social media. It was reported that he dropped 11 pounds and cut his body fat by seven percent. This gave some Washington fans a sense of hope after a disappointing rookie campaign. Haskins was named a team captain and the starting quarterback leading into Week 1.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Haskins led Washington to a </span><a href="https://www.nfl.com/games/eagles-at-football-team-2020-reg-1" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Week 1 win</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> over the Philadelphia Eagles with 17 completions for 178 yards, a touchdown, and no turnovers. Haskins would proceed to lose the next three games, including a three-turnover game against Cleveland, posting just 939 yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions total.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Heading into Week 5, Haskins was benched for offseason signee Kyle Allen and moved to the third-string spot, behind Alex Smith. Whether it had to do with poor performance, work ethic or the reports that he was </span><a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/football-team/dwayne-haskins-reported-stat-bragging-after-loss-furthers-maturity" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">bragging about his stats after a Week 4 loss to Baltimore</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, this came as a shock to many. After Allen suffered a season-ending leg injury, Smith was called up to start in Week 10 and Haskins moved to the second-string spot.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In Week 14 against the San Francisco 49ers, Haskins had to relieve Smith at the start of the second half due to a calf injury to Smith. Haskins looked far from impressive, throwing just 7 completions on 12 attempts for 51 yards in the second half, including a horribly-missed slant pass to Terry McLaurin that nearly led to an interception in Washington's own red zone. Haskins is lucky that Washington was able to score two defensive touchdowns, courtesy of rookies Chase Young and Kamren Curl, because he could not get the offense going whatsoever.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After the Week 14 win, Rivera stated that he has shown growth since being benched in Week 5. "The first couple of series, you saw a lot of quick decisions, good decisions… some poise back there just operating the offense" Rivera said to </span><a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/football-team/ron-rivera-saw-growth-dwayne-haskins-relief-effort-vs-49ers" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">NBC Sports Washington</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. After Week 14 and a strong second half in Week 15, I felt confident in Haskins and wanted to see him stick around.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">But, just two days after the Week 15 loss against Seattle, photos of Haskins emerged where he was </span><a href="https://play.hbomax.com/page/urn:hbo:page:home" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">maskless at a club</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. This marked Haskins' second violation of COVID-19 protocols this season. This is just purely immature, especially considering that Rivera just beat cancer earlier this season. Washington fined Haskins for $40,000, the largest COVID-related fine all season from any team.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With Alex Smith's lingering calf injury, Haskins was still chosen to start Washington's Week 16 game against Carolina, with Taylor Heinicke as his backup. In a game where Washington could have clinched the division, Haskins looked horrible, turning the ball over three times in the first half, including two boneheaded interceptions. The offense couldn't get anything going. He was benched halfway through the fourth quarter, ending with just 154 passing yards on 14 for 28 passing with two interceptions and a fumble lost. Following the Week 16 loss, Haskins </span><a href="https://www.hogshaven.com/2020/12/27/22202212/dwayne-haskins-jr-skips-speaking-to-the-media-blows-off-team-but-eventually-agrees-speak-from-home" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">refused to speak to the media</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and he quickly made his way home after the game. He held a press conference from his home. The next day, Haskins was released by Washington.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Haskins was in the second year of his four-year rookie contract. I, personally, tried so hard to believe in Haskins and wanted him to be great, but at a certain point, those feelings went away. He has to work on a lot of his game: fumbles, not telegraphing passes, better decision-making, reading through progressions and so on.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Haskins spent just three seasons at OSU. Haskins redshirted his freshman year, served as the second-string quarterback to J.T. Barrett his second year, and spent his third year as a starter and Heisman finalist. With this being said, coming into the draft, Haskins was relatively inexperienced.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Haskins' rookie year was very unstable, something that will really hurt an inexperienced guy like himself. After Week 5, former head coach Jay Gruden was fired, and they ended the season with just three wins and 24 players on injured reserve. It is certainly possible that Haskins would have been a lot better off with a different team. This season seemed a bit more stable and he would have Alex Smith as his role model, but nothing changed for Haskins. He still made the same mistakes and still misbehaved off of the field.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Another concern is his coachability. During a practice, veteran linebacker Thomas Davis tried to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/karl_diesel/status/1314667203082543104?s=20" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">confront Haskins</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> about staring down routes. Haskins was quick to get defensive, and wouldn't admit that Davis was right. This rubbed a lot of Washington fans the wrong way, considering Davis has been in the league for 15 years, while Haskins is just a second-year man.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As previously mentioned, he struggles a lot with turnovers. In 13 career games, Haskins has fumbled ten times, losing four. One could partially attribute this to the poor play of Washington's offensive line, but it's still inexcusable. On top of this, he has thrown ten interceptions in his career, and from the "eye test," you can see that he doesn't really scan the field and it seems like he picks who he's gonna throw to before the ball is snapped.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After watching Haskins' terrible performance against Carolina, it became clear that Haskins doesn't have what it takes to be an NFL quarterback. I really liked Haskins coming out of OSU, so it was really hard for me to just give up on him, but after his off-field shenanigans and inadequate performances, I knew it was time to say goodbye.</span></p>	33210
31984	Tom Shadyac's directing causes a rollercoaster of emotions	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the wake of the #MeToo movement, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Brian Banks </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">tackles a controversial plot based on false sexual assault allegations. In the film, wrongly accused high school football star Brian Banks (Aldis Hodge) faces time in prison, forcing him to lose his career during his physical peak as well as his dreams of going to the National Football League (NFL).</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31983"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film's cast is headlined by several popular actors including Morgan Freeman as a prison counselor, Sherri Shepherd as Banks' mother and Greg Kinnear as the leader of the California Innocence Project (CIP), an organization that helps innocent people walk free.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Brian Banks</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a dramatized version of the football player's real story, illustrates how a false accusation can ruin a career almost instantly. Banks' fame crashes down when he is arrested based on accusations of kidnapping and raping a classmate. In prison, Banks' prison counselor (Morgan Freeman) turns into an inspirational figure to Banks. Banks is angered by his parole officer's attempt to stop his football career and attempts to regain his freedom with the help of the CIP.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The movie's flashbacks to Banks' high school days contrast his previous happiness to the devastation of being in prison. The production and Hodge's acting blend together beautifully as Banks experiences hallucinations. The film starts with a scene of Banks watching little kids play football at the park, and the ending loops back to that same scene to close the film out smoothly.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Screenwriter Doug Atchison made character development shine throughout the film. The audience watches Banks' parole officer grow to sympathize with Banks after initially having no mercy for him. Banks also grows from a negative, spiteful individual in prison to a positive, persistent one fighting for his freedom.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Brian Banks</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> takes audiences on a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Not only does it keep viewers emotionally invested with characters and plot events, but it also gives an impactful, moving portrayal of a story that is heartbreaking to watch.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The film was released August 9, 2019 and can be viewed at Regal Majestic &amp; IMAX (Silver Spring), Regal Hyattsville Royale, Arclight Bethesda and Regal Gallery Place. The film is rated PG-13 and is based on a true story.</em></p>	31983
32574	The Blazers won 78-66 against the Cavaliers	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair boys' varsity basketball team (7-2) defeated Kennedy (3-5) by a score of 78-66 in their fifth home game of the season on Monday night.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite losing the tip-off, the Blazers started the first quarter strong. Thanks to baskets by junior guards Alfred Worrell and Jacob Briggs, Blair was leading 7-0 within the first minute of the game. Though the Cavaliers got back into the game, baskets from junior guard Roman Cannuscio, Worrell, senior guard Liam Olagbaju and junior center Tommy Waltz-Chesnaye kept Blair in the lead. The Blazers ended the first quarter strong up 21-10.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32573"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the second quarter, Kennedy continued to struggle as its players committed multiple fouls and gave Blair several free throws. Briggs and senior forward Bakarr Bangura played exceptionally, scoring a combined 15 points for the team in the second quarter. At halftime, Blair was leading 44-25.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although the Blazers were leading by 19 points, there were many turnovers from both teams in the second quarter. Waltz-Chesnaye thought that the team could tighten its plays and limit turnovers. "There were points in which it [the game] got kind of sloppy. We had a lot of long passes where we kind of threw the ball away," he said. Coach Damon Pigrom also showed concern regarding turnovers. "[We can improve on our] ball security," Pigrom said. "I think we turn over the ball too much."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Throughout the third quarter, the Blazers maintained their enthusiasm and continued making solid plays. But, the Cavaliers started to catch up as they followed up many of Blair's baskets with an immediate goal of their own. The quarter ended with Kennedy making 19 points and Blair 20 points. Still, the Blazers were ahead by 20 points, with the score being 64-44 going into the final quarter.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When the fourth quarter began, the Blazers started to lag a little, resulting in many more turnovers. The Cavaliers took advantage of this, scoring a total of 22 points throughout the last quarter. Especially in the last three and a quarter minutes of the game, Kennedy significantly outscored the Blazers. But in the end, Kennedy could not mount enough points and Blair came out with a 78-66 victory.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Waltz-Chesnaye noted that it was a good game, though there were some areas for improvement. "I think it was a good team win," Waltz-Chesnaye said. "I think an important thing going forward is limiting turnovers." Pigrom praised the team's defense and said that it could still work on its offense some more. "Defensively, we were pretty good," he said. "[But] we are not running our offenses as well as we want to."</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Wednesday, Jan. 15 against Springbrook at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	32573
32972	The improvements and lack of intriguing titles just aren’t worth $500	<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Those who play video games are surely aware that Sony is releasing its PlayStation 5 (PS5) November 12. Seeing as it will likely take many Blazers until its release to save up for the console, now is an excellent time to determine whether it will be worth buying. When the PS5 is initially released and its price is the highest, it is not a worthwhile purchase.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As of Sep. 16, </span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/16/playstation-5-launches-in-november-starting-at-399-for-ps5-digital-edition-and-499-for-ps5-with-ultra-hd-blu-ray-disc-drive/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Sony has confirmed the price of the PS5 to be $399 for the digital edition and $499 for a PS5 with a disc drive</a><span style="background-color: transparent;"> (since the $499 model offers the possibility of playing owned PS4 discs and watching movies on discs, it’s the better purchase of the two). For reference, the PlayStation 4 (PS4) was $400 at the time of its release, and can currently be purchased for under $300.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The hardware on the PS5 is impressive: a leading reason for the price increase. </span><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">The PS5 boasts a custom-made CPU, SSD, GPU and integrated I/O</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. The PS5 will have incredibly fast load times and offer 8K output.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But the increase of graphical quality is not a good enough reason to purchase the system yet, since the PS4’s graphics are also impressive. Graphics are always improving, so such an improvement is no longer special. It’s just par for the course. With good visuals existing currently on the PS4, it’s hard to justify a new $500 system.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32971"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, while extremely fast load times are appealing, they aren’t enough to diminish the size of the PS5’s price tag. While load times on the PS4 can be slightly annoying, they are by no means excessively long, nor bothersome enough to be worth $500 to decrease.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, if the games on the PS5 were exceptional, then discussion of graphics matters a lot less, as game selection is typically the best reason to buy a system. But the PS5 doesn’t have enough appealing exclusives to warrant its purchase at its release.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The console has some intriguing titles, however, “Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales,” the follow-up to 2018’s “Marvel’s Spider-Man” is by far the most compelling reason Sony has provided to purchase the PS5. Considering “Marvel’s Spider-Man” was a smash hit and incredible game, it makes sense that this could be just as good, if not better. However, unfortunately for the PS5, “Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales” is also available for the PS4, meaning that PS4 owners could save themselves $500 and buy the game for their current system and upgrade the game to the PS5 for free.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">PS4 owners should also consider that while the PS5 launches this November, it’s likely that there will be several years before the PS4 becomes irrelevant. While Sony launched the PS4 in 2013 in the US, it wasn’t until 2017 that production of PlayStation 3 systems ceased. The PS4 isn’t going anywhere soon, and as long as new games continue to be released on the PS4, buying an entirely new system seems excessive.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As of right now, the PS5 is not a worthwhile purchase at release for current PS4 owners.

32885	The new Hulu series brings  much needed diversity to the coming out story	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Love, Victor” is a heartwarming Hulu series that touches on very real issues for LGBTQ+ teenagers, especially those living in less than accepting environments. Released on June 17, “Love, Victor” is a spin-off of&nbsp;“Love, Simon” (2018), a movie directed by Greg Berlanti that sees Simon Spier (Nick Robinson) come to terms with his sexuality and figure out how to come out to his friends and family. “Love, Victor,” directed by Berlanti as well, focuses on Victor Salazar (Michael Cimino), a 15-year-old moving from Texas to Georgia and starting high school at Creekwood High </span><span style="color: rgb(60, 64, 67);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> the same high school that Simon went to before graduating.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Victor faces many different problems as he begins life in Georgia, from his parents’ (James Martinez and Ana Ortiz) rocky marriage to the struggles of fitting in at a new school. He soon makes friends with Felix Westen (Anthony Turpel), his new neighbor, and the first two episodes see him grow a friendship with Mia Brooks (Rachel Naomi Hilson). Despite Victor’s hopes that a new school will mean a new start for him, and a chance to express who he is, it is difficult for him to do so, because he is afraid to come out and possibly ruin his chances of making new friends. Additionally, he hears other boys making derogatory comments about gay people, which further discourages him from expressing himself.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Love, Victor” primarily connects to “Love, Simon” through Victor and Simon’s interactions online. After hearing the story of how Simon came out and the immense support he received from his family and friends, Victor angrily messages Simon, telling Simon&nbsp;that he had it easy, and that not all kids were lucky enough to have the same amount of support. Simon agrees, and says that he can’t possibly understand what Victor is going through. The two continue to message each other throughout the episodes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The contrast between Victor and Simon’s experiences is an interesting and important part of the show. “Love, Simon,” while groundbreaking and touching in its own right, presents a positive coming out experience that is by no means universal. In contrast, “Love, Victor” </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">aims to reach teenagers with less than positive experiences by creating a character who has conservative parents and friends who are not shown to be as open-minded.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">﻿</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32884"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The series answers some of the criticism that “Love, Simon” received and expands on the idea of questioning your sexuality as a teenager. A key difference between the two works is that whereas Simon was sure of himself, Victor is still trying to figure out who he is.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to discussing topics surrounding sexuality, “Love, Victor” puts an emphasis on class issues. Creekwood High School is depicted as upper-class, with many students wearing expensive clothing and throwing wild parties; Victor’s family, on the other hand, has money problems.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">An ongoing theme, expressed in the first episode, is the fact that Victor’s poorer background is a source of shame for him. This results in altercations with other students, and a loss of opportunities. However, it also is a way to drive the plot, as it kicks off his hunt for a job, which becomes important as the show progresses.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Love, Victor” is overall a well done and fun show, although there are some cheesy moments, like a scene in which he is training to work as a barista and is shown how to run the machines by Benji (George Sear) in a truly rom-com worthy montage. Additionally, some moments seem structured specifically to give a lesson or moral, as opposed to furthering the story, for example, Victor starting to become popular but at the cost of one of his friends, which he realizes quickly and fixes. Although this does show character development, it happens abruptly, and seems to be more of a message about how you shouldn’t abandon friends for popularity than an actual plot point.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fans of “Love, Simon” will notice that the camera work in “Love, Victor” is very similar, with the same types of shots and emphasis on similar moments, such as the slow-motion montages that occur when Victor sees attractive guys. Additionally, the title font is the same for both works, and obviously, the title structure is the same as well. This makes the show really feel like it is almost part of the same story of “Love, Simon” and helps the general cohesion of the story.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Love, Victor” contains fairly realistic characters, although some elements of them may be exaggerated. The tropes are clear, with Felix falling easily into a characteristic of an unpopular best friend, but Victor himself is a little more realistic. He faces struggles and responds to them in ways that make sense. Since the characters don’t feel too unrealistic, it is relatively easy to empathize with them, and become invested in the story. Moments are bolstered with a soundtrack containing songs like “Someone Like You” by BANNERS, giving it the feel of a teenage movie but managing to pack an emotional punch at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite the use of cliches and some cheesy dialogue, “Love, Victor” is an enjoyable watch and an important look into the life of a teenager who wants to find himself. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32884
32079	Yoko Zoll and two Level 4 students went to Japan with other Japan Bowl participants	<p>In July, Blair Japanese teacher Yoko Zoll and two graduates from the class of 2019 accompanied 49 other students from the United States and Canada, as well as two teachers from Canada, on an eight-day trip to Japan. All of the students were participants in the 2019 Japan Bowl, an annual Japanese language and culture competition held in Washington, D.C. All the students had studied Japanese for four years.</p><p>The trip was organized and awarded to the students by an exchange program between North America and Japan called the Kakehashi Project, which is coordinated by the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) and Japanese International Cooperation Center and sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>The students and teachers on the trip got the opportunity to meet Princess Takamado and First Lady Akie Abe. They also took part in Zazen —meditation at a zen temple— attended a traditional Japanese tea ceremony, visited a Japanese high school,experienced homestay in Sapporo, explored Tokyo and learned the Yosakoi Soran dance.&nbsp;</p><p>Zoll was honored to meet the First Lady because it's not an opportunity that regular Japanese people have. "You don't go to the White House and meet the president," she said, "It's the same thing."</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32078"></div><p>Many students were visiting Japan for the first time and greatly enjoyed the homestay. "None of them had experienced that," Zoll said. "Living in a Japanese family, most of them don't speak English," she said, adding that the stay gave the students an opportunity to practice their Japanese. Her own favorite part of the trip was visiting the imperial palace,&nbsp;where she had never been before.</p><p>She also loved getting to meet Princess Takamado. The students on the trip asked the princess questions in both Japanese and English, and the princess responded in whichever language they asked in. "Her English was perfect," Zoll said.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, it was Zoll's first time participating in Zazen, a meditation with three 10-minute sessions and a one-minute break in between each session. She described how a monk is usually walking around the temple as you meditate. "If you bow, he taps both of your shoulders," she said.</p><p>Overall, Zoll considered the trip a success and said she was glad that no students got lost and only one student got sick. "When I took my students to Japan in 2014, four students went missing," she said. "[They] didn't come at a certain time or to a certain place. Those things happen when you take lots of people. Some get sick, some get lost," she added. "This time, nobody got lost," she said.</p><p><br></p>	32078
31564	More than 600 attendees enjoyed free food, entertainment and resources	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Friday, Jan. 11, more than 600 federal workers, contractors and their families attended the Shutdown Social at Montgomery Blair High School's cafeteria from 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Organized by Montgomery County Councilmember Tom Hucker, the event was an opportunity for the Silver Spring and Takoma Park community to show their support for furloughed federal employees.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Shutdown Social provided food, entertainment and support for federal workers and helped them realize they are not alone. "</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This event was set up to show solidarity for all the federal workers who provide federal services but have been locked out of work and have not been paid," </span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31562"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">David McGivern from the Food and Drug Administration attended the event for a "fun social experience" and to see what support and resources were available. "It gets you out of the house because you don't want to go anywhere since you don't want to spend any money," he said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Seventeen local restaurants, including McGinty's Pub, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">El Golfo and Ghar-e-Kabab, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">provided free food and drinks, despite their own struggling businesses. "</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Business is way down because of the shutdown, but still, a whole lot of restaurants have donated food tonight because they want to step up and support the community," Hucker said. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Musician and labor activist Joe Uehlein organized the night's entertainment, which included a performance from Northwood High School's drumline. "The music was specially pulled together from artists whose music moves people. The hope is it will inspire people to do more to support the federal workers," Uehlein said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Local organizations, such as the Montgomery County Department of Housing and Community Affairs, Consumer Law Center and </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (WSSC), attended to offer advice on paying bills to federal </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">employees. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The WSSC, which provides safe drinking water and wastewater treatment to Montgomery and Prince George's counties, is not turning off water for at least the next 45 days so federal workers have water even if they are behind on paying their bills. "Our goal today is to come out for our constituents and let them know we're here for them through these hard times," WSSC employee Misti Prince said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31563"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The government shutdown, now the longest in American history, resulted from a stalemate between President Donald Trump and Democrats over his demand for funding to build a wall along the border of the United States and Mexico. Currently, around 800,000 federal workers are furloughed and did not receive their pay stubs on Friday. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The shutdown has stirred panic amongst federal workers who depend on their biweekly paychecks to pay their bills. McGivern, who has a 14-month-old son, moved to Maryland in October and has yet to sell his old house. "I can't make that house sell any faster, so it's made it very difficult for us. I don't know how long this will go on, so we have to make contingency plans to cover all the bills," he said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although a bill passed by Congress on Friday guarantees back pay to furloughed federal workers, the paycheck will not arrive in time for many employees' bills, which range from mortgage to college tuition.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> "</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">The paychecks have stopped coming in, but all of you know the bills keep rolling in the door," Van Hollen said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The federal workers, contractors and families at the social bonded over their frustration and worry about the shutdown. "I just hope that something can happen, that [the government] can come to a consensus that can get these people back to work and get America— what did [Trump] say again?—great again. We're not great right now," Prince said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, frustration and panic continue to plague federal workers and their families. However, at least for one night, they were able to find support and relief from their community.</span></p>	31562
32927	How to make your classmates and teachers feel welcome during online classes	<p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This school year is unprecedented in many ways. The cancellation of in-person classes and fall and winter school sport seasons will make it more difficult to build a school community where students feel like they belong. In order to make sure that everyone feels welcome during our online classes, let's review what pronouns are and how we can use them to show respect to one another.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">A Rundown of Pronouns</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pronouns are the words we use to refer to someone when we don't use their name. Take a moment to ask yourself if you are someone who has never thought about their pronouns before. Those of us who have this privilege also have a responsibility to ensure that we are creating a space in our classrooms where everyone can use their preferred pronouns.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">You can't always assume people's pronouns by looking at them, so it is a good practice to introduce yourself with your pronouns. For those of us who are cisgender (identify with the gender assigned to us at birth), making a habit of introducing our pronouns helps to normalize them as something that we should talk about so that everyone feels safe. For example, to introduce myself, I would say, "My name is Myles and I use he/him pronouns," before I ask what someone else's pronouns are.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Max Pauls, a sophomore at Blair who uses he/him and they/them pronouns, said that in their experience, pronouns have been a taboo subject at school. "It's always been awkward. If it's a room full of cisgendered kids, you wouldn't expect them to introduce their pronouns," Pauls says. While they acknowledged that MCPS has taken some actions to normalize pronouns, it is still a far cry from ensuring that all students feel fully accepted by their teachers and peers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Pauls also emphasized that small adjustments in the behavior of cisgender students can go a long way. "With the incorrect use of pronouns, it can be extremely uncomfortable," Pauls says. Using the correct pronouns to address someone is a way to be an ally to trans and gender non-conforming students. It can be difficult to be the only gender diverse student in the room, but knowing that your peers will be there for support makes all the difference.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32926"></div><p><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Misgendering</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The incorrect use of pronouns is known as misgendering, and it can make someone feel that their identity is invalid and that they are not accepted for who they are. Misgendering someone doesn't make you a terrible person, but if you make a mistake please acknowledge it and move on without embarrassing the person. If you hear someone else use the wrong pronouns, gently correct them in the moment or in private later.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What if a student or teacher continuously misgenders another person during online class? This could be either intentional or unintentional. Regardless, there are ways to address this behavior in a way that is polite and does not embarrass either person. Some ways to politely correct them include a private message over Zoom, an email, or, if it seems appropriate, you could just tell them outright.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Being an Ally</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Using the right pronouns when you refer to someone makes that person feel welcome, valid, and respected. It's an easy way to be an ally to those who identify as genderqueer, gender non-binary, or transgender. Of course, you can be cisgender and choose whatever pronouns you feel most comfortable with because at the end of the day we all just want our personal identities and choices to be respected. No one set of pronouns is more valid than another.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Whatever pronouns you choose to introduce yourself with, please be serious about it. Making jokes about pronouns doesn't make you cool or funny it just makes you look uneducated and disrespectful. Also, it's never a good idea to refer to someone using the words "he-she" or "it" because both of these terms are dehumanizing.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Here are some suggestions for how to introduce your pronouns:</span></p><ul><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Put them in your social media bios</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Add them onto your Zoom name</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Put them in your email signature</span></li><li><span style="background-color: transparent;">Say your pronouns when you introduce yourself to someone new</span></li></ul><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Creating a habit of introducing your pronouns and respecting everyone else's pronouns will help to make our online classes more open and welcoming for all our teachers and students. It's a way to be an ally for the LGBTQ+ community, and it makes people feel respected. If you are still confused on what pronouns are and how to use them, take some time to educate yourself on them using the following resources.</span></p><p><a href="https://uccs.edu/lgbtresourcecenter/pronouns-101" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Pronouns 101</a></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_tMtzJz20" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Should I Put My Pronouns In My Bio?</a></p><p><a href="https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Gender Pronouns</a></p><p><br></p>	32926
32715	Sophomore Ethan Shoham lands a spot with a nationally-acclaimed touring group	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Musicians usually spend years practicing their instrument and perfecting their craft. However, for sophomore Ethan Shoham, it only took him six-months of practice to land a spot in a nationally-renowned drum and bugle corps. This past January, Shoham won a contract to play the mellophone with the Spartans Drum and Bugle Corps and to tour all across the United States over the summer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Shoham originally heard about the experience from the Blair band teacher Raife Oldham, and marching band leader, Edward Kirk. “Mr. Oldham showed us a video of the winner of the previous nationals season. Seeing this beautiful show captured me. The performance was on a level I had not thought possible, and I wanted to be on that level,” Shoham says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">After a bit more research, Ethan found to his disappointment that DCI, only took drumline, valved brass instruments, and colorguard. “I had initially been playing clarinet for seven years. However, the corps was brass and percussion only. I was impressed and really wanted to be there, so I decided to switch [from clarinet to mellophone],” Shoham states.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Switching instruments is not an easy feat, especially from woodwind to brass. The clarinet is mainly a melody instrument, while the mellophone can be overpowering. “The mellophone is a little bit like a french horn, but more piercing and a lot more powerful. The moment I knew I wanted to do DCI is when I saw a performance open with 24 trombones blasting an opening. The pure power and volume that is produced is awesome,” Shoham continues.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32713"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kirk comments that what Shoham did is nothing short of incredible. “To join DCI, you have to be between the ages of 16 and 21. He is 16 and in a corps. That’s a really big deal, and he’ll be marching with college kids,” Kirk comments.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the start of Shoham’s journey towards a spot in a DCI corps, Kirk was with him every step of the way. “Ethan started over the summer with the mellophone from square one. Every now and then, I would meet with him and give him advice. When the school year rolled around again, he started playing mellophone in the band to gain more experience. In the DCI corps, they have to hit hundreds of positions in one show,” Kirk continues.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The instrument switch was just the beginning. In order to get into such a competitive touring group such as the Spartan’s touring group, one must be willing to put in travel, hours of repetition, and a multitude of disappointment.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The audition process comes with grueling hours and sleepless nights. “It was a week-end long workshop where they teach you their style of marching. They then pulled you into a room with two other people and you played your prepared music for them. These weekend long auditions happen once a month from November to February. If you don’t make it in the first audition, they tell you to come back next month for another shot,” Shoham says, “I actually had to audition two times before I got the contract and offer to tour with them.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite all the hard work he put in, Shoham says that he wouldn’t rather spend that time doing anything else. Shoham cites the whole community experience as what inspires him the most in marching band. “It’s an experience like nothing else. I am so lucky to have found [marching band] people. You boil together at band camp and freeze together at parades. Spending weeks on end with these kids and living out of each other’s pockets will be like nothing I’ve ever experienced before,” Shoham concludes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Shoham’s main takeaway for aspiring musicians is perseverance. He advises others to try marching out and see what it’s like playing in a corps. At the end of the day, Shoham hopes that he can open doors and set an example for others. He notes that marching band is a big family that works together and that you truly feel “unstoppable.”</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">See Ethan Shoham perform with the Spartans Drum &amp; Bugle Corps </em><a href="https://spartansdbc.org/events/friends-family-day/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>here</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.

33450	Olivia Rodrigo’s debut album is pure lyrical genius and shows a talent that will undoubtedly continue to grow	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33449"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On May 21, Olivia Rodrigo released her debut album, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sour</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. At only 18 years old, the singer shares valuable lessons about the emotional rollercoaster of a breakup, leveraging her powerful vocals and unique sound to do so. The album’s greatest strength lies in Rodrigo’s authenticity, from the audible pain in her voice to relatable lyrics about insecurity, anxiety and trust.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rodrigo released her first single off of </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sour</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, “driver’s license,” on Jan. 8. The passionate piano ballad is rumored to be about her HSMTMTS co-star who moved on to date another Disney star; in fact, the whirlwind of </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/drivers-license-skin-and-lie-lie-lie-whats-the-connection-33337/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">rumors</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> pushed the song to debut at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart where it remained for eight consecutive weeks and set a record for most streams in a week on Spotify (only recently beaten by Rodrigo’s own “good 4 u” on May 28). However, the reason people repeatedly streamed the song again goes back to relatability and authenticity — despite singing about a specific personal episode, Rodrigo tugs at universal memories of abandonment and the sense of getting left behind.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The next two singles off the album, “deja vu” and “good 4 u,” show off Rodrigo’s versatility and helped listeners get a sense of Rodrigo’s style. In “deja vu,” a sense of fading time is created by the tactful use of twinkling bells, lingering guitar and a melody that feels unsettled. The bridge hits hard as Rodrigo sings, “Strawberry ice cream in Malibu / Don't act like we didn't do that sh*t, too.” The song is targeted, and the unique sound is captivating.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the other hand, “good 4 u” is a refreshing rager, reminiscent of the pop-punk era of the '90s-'00s and more specifically Paramore’s “Misery Business” (2007). The piercing lyrics, rock 'n roll inspired guitar runs and rolling drum beat create an angsty vibe as a vengeful Rodrigo confronts an ex who seems to have moved on too quickly. Plus, screaming the song — especially the chorus, “Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy / Not me, if you ever cared to ask…” — is incredibly cathartic.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With these three singles and </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sour </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">as a whole, Rodrigo is breaking multiple records in the music industry. For one, both “driver’s license” and “good 4 u” debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts, with “deja vu” only debuting a few spots lower at #8. And with approximately 385 million streams, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sour </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">has broken the record for biggest opening week for an album by a female artist in global Spotify history. This shows tremendous promise in what’s to come as Rodrigo continues growing as an artist.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Circling back to the overarching theme of heartbreak in the album, Rodrigo puts forth “traitor” where she addresses the hurtful behaviors in a relationship that don’t technically fit the definition of cheating. She also sings “one step forward, three steps back” in which she ponders mixed signals that she knows deep-down are bad news; “enough for you” in which she explores a regret for investing so much time into a doomed relationship; “happier” where she hopes her ex is happy but not happier with his new girlfriend; and “favorite crime” in which she targets making peace with feeling responsible for being treated badly in a relationship.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">These are all beautiful lyrical songs, opening with mellow guitar strums and instrumentals that continue throughout. When listened to individually, each is a well-crafted masterpiece with a distinct life lesson. Yet, when listened to as part of the album as a whole (at least on the first couple of listens), the songs seem to run together and feel slightly repetitive. Additionally, the angry “good 4 u” serves as an abrupt bridge between the more melodic tunes “deja vu” and “enough for u”; the near-shout vocal delivery style on “good 4 u” is a pretty jarring break between the other two relatively calm tracks.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The other songs on the album — “brutal,” “jealousy, jealousy,” and “hope ur ok” — are also confessionals about teenage problems. Opening track “brutal” has a grungy sound, complete with the lyrics, “And I'm so sick of seventeen/ Where's my f*cking teenage dream?” and “God, it’s brutal out here” that expose the lie that our youth is full of only sunshine and rainbows. “jealousy, jealousy” shares this frustration, using carefully crafted lines like, “Comparison is killin’ me slowly / I think I think too much ’bout kids who don’t know me,” to diagnose our generation’s unhealthy social media usage.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The closing song of the album, “hope ur ok” is a message of support for those who aren’t accepted by their parents for various reasons — one verse alludes to a girl who identifies as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. The stripped down song feels sad, but it echoes a common sentiment that everyone struggles as they’re growing up and discovering who they are.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It’s also crucial to note that Rodrigo is a diehard Swiftie because the inspiration that she draws from Taylor Swift is evident. Beyond the masterful easter eggs in music videos, there is also similar pointed lyricism and cadence. Each song also has a powerful, well-crafted bridge. However, Rodrigo is in no regard a copycat—her personality and sound is in a league all of its own.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a whole, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sour </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">is (brutally) honest. The emotions Rodrigo conveys reflect her self-awareness; sometimes the lessons she sings about are surface level, but this can be attributed to her age and relative inexperience. The album is doubly impactful for listeners who are Rodrigo’s age and going through the same tumultuous experiences that she sings so vulnerably about. Definitely would recommend at least one listen, if not endless.&nbsp;</span></p>	33449
31997	This weekend was a rough start to the Nationals’ pennant race	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Washington Nationals are yet again in the depths of the pennant race in an attempt to make the 2019 Major League Baseball (MLB) playoffs. This weekend, they played a make-or-break series against the New York Mets. The Nationals, who are now six-and-a-half games out of first place in the National League East, lost the series 2-1 to the Mets, who have now won 15 of their last 17 games.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31996"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Going into the weekend, Nationals fans hoped that the series would give the team a strong start to their race for the playoffs. The Nationals had a horrible start to the season. With little offense and a failing bullpen, they were under .500 for quite some time. Though they sprung back and had a stellar June and July, closing their gap with the Atlanta Braves and taking the lead in the wild card race, this series was not all that the Nationals had hoped it would be.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first two games were all-around disappointing for the Nationals. The Mets came back in the eighth and ninth respectively to win both games, but the Nationals avoided the sweep, pulling through with a 7-4 win on Sunday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Washington fans are praying that the team will make the playoffs after a rough 2018 season. The Nationals' midsummer resurgence left many with higher spirits. “It feels like there’s a little more electricity in the stadium. It feels like the fans have a little bit more energy. We feel like we play with maybe a little bit more urgency,” Nationals closer Sean Doolittle </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/pennant-races-are-rare-in-washington-but-the-nationals-are-finally-about-to-be-in-one/2019/07/29/4356e592-b219-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">told the Washington Post</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although the fanbase has been energized, they are staying cautious. “I think that they have a good shot as long as everyone plays the way they have since the All Star break,” Blair junior Nick Layke said. “But injuries and closers could easily puts the Nats back in the situation they were in at the beginning of the season.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This weekend's series especially highlighted the bullpen's weakness. The relievers faltered when the Nationals were already ahead, which has been one of the team’s biggest issues this season. In order to make the playoffs, the Nationals will need to win games like the ones that they lost to the Mets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This series is the first of a long line of high-stakes games taking place over the next month as postseason approaches. The Nationals will be fighting to keep their spot as the wild card and potentially close the lead the Atlanta Braves hold in the division.&nbsp;</span></p>	31996
32119	The Blazers defeated the Warriors 3-0 to stay undefeated in their conference	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair Blazers (9-2) defeated the Sherwood Warriors (5-4) 3-0 on Monday, Oct. 7 in their second-to-last conference game of the season. Coming off of four straight wins with scoring in the double digits, the Blazers saw a more formidable opponent in Sherwood than in some of their recent games but still managed to win handily through strong defense and passing.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32118"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both teams played solid defense in the first half. Junior defenders Indigo Suchar and Jadyn Harvey recovered quickly whenever Sherwood got the ball, preventing the Warriors from getting many scoring opportunities. Senior goalkeeper Zoë Abramson made several saves, helping to keep the game scoreless. Sherwood's defense played well until junior Emilie Vigliotta had a well-placed goal that she shot between two Sherwood defenders with less than five minutes left in the half. Vigliotta wasn't originally planning to shoot, but scoring in a close game like this one felt amazing for her. "I was going to pass at first, but I saw the opening and took it, and that was one of the best moments of my life," she said. The Blazers were able to keep up that momentum in the second half, as they put the pressure on Sherwood both offensively and defensively. Senior captain Noa Dorah took several shots, one of which the Warriors' goalkeeper missed and a defender accidentally tapped in when trying to save it, giving Blair their second goal of the night. Dorah later scored a goal of her own off an assist by senior co-captain Janie Pitner. The Blazers' defense was able to hold off Sherwood for the rest of the night to earn a 3-0 victory. The team will play their final conference game of the season this Thursday, Oct. 10 at 7:15 p.m. at Northwood. Vigliotta and the rest of the team have high hopes of winning their conference and for the post-season. "We're going to states," she said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers play their next home game against the Walter Johnson Wildcats on Tuesday, Oct. 15 at 7:15 p.m.</em></p><p><br></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Editor’s note: Emilie Vigliotta is a staff writer on Silver Chips.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32118
32092	The Blazers out-possessed the Panthers to improve their record to 7-2	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair Blazers (7-2) obliterated the Paint Branch Panthers (0-6) 10-1 on Thursday, Sept. 26. The Blazers maintained possession for most of the game, starting off strong with two goals from senior captain Noa Dorah. Freshman Magda Goles then scored to give Blair a 3-0 lead. The Panthers responded with a header from senior Nadia Fox off of a direct kick to make it a two-point game. However, Paint Branch barely touched the ball for the rest of the half while struggling to maintain possession when they gained the ball. Blair continued to dominate, with sophomore Marlee Ginyard scoring two goals and junior Sophia Kim scoring one, assisted by senior captain Janie Pitner. Dorah put one more in before the end of the first half, when the Blazers led 7-1. Blair had lots of good passing throughout the second half, and continued to have possession for the majority of the time. Dorah and Kim both scored another goal as did senior Dede Greenfield. Although it wasn't her best game, Dorah was satisfied with her hat trick. "I missed a few opportunities, but I put a few away, so it's okay," she said. Paint Branch couldn't recover from a nine-point deficit, as the Blazers cruised to a 10-1 victory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers play their next home game against the Sherwood Warriors on Monday, Oct. 7 at 7:15 p.m.</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32091
32067	Blazers even out their record to 3-3	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair Blazers (3-3) defeated the Springbrook Blue Devils (0-5) on Sept. 23 by a score of 3-1 after losing two straight games to Gaithersburg and Churchill. "After that home game against Churchill, I think that the guys really connected and played well together on both sides of the ball," head coach Edvin Hernandez said.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32044"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the first half of the game, senior midfielder Walter Sosa and senior forward Nate Tesfaw set up senior Silas Reitsma for a goal. Sophomore Hernan Guzman soon followed with a goal off of Reitsma's assist, getting the Blazers up 2-0 going into halftime. During the second half, Reitsma scored a tap-in goal off the rebound of senior Wilmer Gonzalez's shot. The Blue Devils scored late in the second half, but it was too late to make a comeback.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Reitsma was responsible for all three of the Blazers' goals against a tough opponent in Springbrook. The game was the first conference game of the season, which plays a part in determining the seeding for playoffs. "I hope it's the start of something and it motivates us to play better in the rest of the season. Conference play is the most important and it's good to start with a win," Reitsma said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers play their next home game against the Kennedy Cavaliers on Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019 at 7:15 p.m.</em></p>	32044
32219	MCPS inspects safety in athletic teams following a rape incident at Damascus High School	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Oct. 7, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) released findings from an external review of its school district policies at a press conference held in The Carver Educational Services Center in Rockville. International law firm </span><a href="https://www.wilmerhale.com/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">WilmerHale</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> conducted the external review following an incident in October 2018 when five Damascus High School (DHS) junior varsity football players </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/damascus-football-players-accused-of-hazing-rape-indicted" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">sexually assaulted several teammates</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32218"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The review found no evidence of widespread bullying, hazing or sexual assault in MCPS, and concluded that MCPS fosters "</span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/departments/publicinfo/WilmerHale-MCPS-External-Review-Report.PDF" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">a generally positive culture around athletics and other extracurriculars</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">WilmerHale interviewed MCPS Superintendent Jack Smith, the Montgomery County State’s Attorney and other county officials for the investigation. They did not interview the DHS victims, alleged perpetrators or their families.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The review focused on extracurricular activities across the county rather than just athletics. In the investigation, WilmerHale interviewed administrators, staff members, coaches, parents and after-school activity sponsors at DHS. It also conducted focus groups with principals, assistant principals, business administrators, coaches, athletic directors and extracurricular sponsors at Montgomery Blair High School, Walter Johnson High School, Walt Whitman High School and Seneca Valley High School.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Khalif Welch, a quarterback on Blair's varsity football team, agreed with the review's findings, saying that hazing is unheard of at Blair. "There is nothing extreme," Welch said. "There is always going to be playing with friends, but there is nothing I would call hazing."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although the review stated that bullying, hazing and sexual assault are not prevalent in MCPS athletics, WilmerHale acknowledged that they "did not perform a comprehensive, historical review of unreported incidents." The law firm also noted that students often did not know how to identify acts of hazing or how to respond to such incidents.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To address this issue, the external review recommended creating "in-person interactive hazing training and programming" for students, administrators and athletic directors. Smith </span><a href="https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/schools/no-systemic-hazing-problems-in-mcps-report-says/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">reiterated this sentiment</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> in reference to the county's commitment to students' safety at the press conference. "We’re in an era where student safety is a core part of what we do," Smith said at the press conference. "We need to continue to enhance… and promote that."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Going forward, MCPS plans to partner with the </span><a href="https://ncs4.usm.edu/home" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">National Center for Sports Spectator Safety and Security</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to improve practices on after-school safety, security and supervision. MCPS will also propose new measures to allocate more resources to after-school security for the 2021 fiscal year.</span></p>	32218
31638	Adiba Chowdhury represents diversity among students	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">OneBlair co-president. Youth leader of a local Muslim Ummah of North America (MUNA) chapter. Former Student Government Association (SGA) president at Eastern Middle School. And now, Student Member of the Board (SMOB) candidate. Since middle school, junior Adiba Chowdhury has chased her passion for change and community advocacy as a student leader.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chowdhury's enthusiasm for humanitarian issues faced opposition from her parents when she was younger. Despite her parents' efforts to pressure her to pursue science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), Chowdhury found herself more interested in the humanities. Her brother, in contrast, was a 2016 Blair Magnet graduate, an outstanding student and STEM aficionado.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A strong supporter of Chowdhury's decision to run for SMOB, her brother told her that she didn't have to be a straight-A STEM star in order to succeed in life— a message Chowdhury says she "needed to hear." She was emboldened to run after recognizing the achievement gap and unequal distribution of opportunities and resources among students. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chowdhury wanted to provide more resources for her peers after seeing her friends stay up until 1:00 a.m. finishing homework and hearing classmates express fear about joining classes because of their stilted English. "I intend to re-prioritize what MCPS has in mind. We have to set the needs of students over funding this and that, because we are here to ensure that every student has the right environment to succeed," she says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31637"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">To close the achievement gap, Chowdhury hopes to reform in-school suspension by providing students with tutoring and Chromebooks to ensure that they are less likely to fall into the school-to-prison pipeline. Other goals she has in mind include minimizing the importance of standardized testing; providing the magnet application test to all third, fifth and eighth grade students; expanding elective options and creating career pathway programs for students who don't intend to go to college.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chowdhury's platform also focuses on obtaining resources for immigrant students who require English for Speakers of Other Languages, modernizing the infrastructure in technology, making sure that physical and mental health are prioritized and empowering students through student advocacy. "I have always been someone who wants to ensure that everyone I meet has an opportunity to share what they want to say," Chowdhury says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Junior Hailey Mitchell works on Chowdhury's campaign and spreads her message by producing promotional videos and managing her social media. "I've been friends with Adiba since elementary school, and I've always known her as such a kind, dedicated, hard-working person," she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chowdhury, who describes herself as "determined, stubborn and passionate," has shown her strong devotion to student advocacy through various positions in the community. As the Montgomery County Regional SGA's Educational Policy Deputy, she proposes and works on policies that students support. She also supports young Muslim women in debate tournaments and helps them practice public speaking as a MUNA chapter head.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chowdhury says she developed her biggest strength, being open and able to understand different perspectives, by listening to Blair's diverse voices as OneBlair co-president. She has organized events focusing on student advocacy and facilitating communication among the student body, such as Blair Interracial Dialogue Week. She also recently hosted a OneBlair dialogue on the December Silver Chips Print article "Do CAP and Magnet benefit the student body?” to encourage discussion between program and non-program students. "We talked about why program and academy students are so divided and what we as a school can do to fix these issues and ensure that no one group is isolated," she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Chowdhury has demonstrated her commitment to the interest of all students, especially those who are typically underrepresented. </span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">"I feel that [Chowdhury's] experience as a Muslim woman of color makes her platform unique from others, since she understands students' problems from a different perspective," Mitchell says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As a junior in high school, Chowdhury has already devoted numerous hours to student advocacy and community service. She vows to bring her experience and determination to the table as SMOB and create tangible change for students across Montgomery County.</span></p>	31637
33238	Blair students and parents’ opinions on the MCPS reopening plan, who should go back to school first and how online learning is affecting them	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Online school has posed a challenge for Blair students. For some, being online all day has caused a lack of motivation. For others who are more extroverted, not being able to interact with peers has made learning difficult. Although online school may not be the best situation, MCPS must balance the mental health of students with their physical health and safety.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33237"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the second semester approaches, MCPS has prepared a plan to reopen schools if COVID-19 cases reach a certain level. </span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">For expanded in-person learning to begin there must be a test positivity rate of five percent or less over a 14 day period, and if the rate goes beyond 15 percent, virtual learning must continue. As of Jan. 12, Maryland has a test positivity rate of 6.6 percent. Due to the high test positivity </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to the </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/reopening/second-semester.aspx" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">MCPS reopening plan</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, students will return to school in three phases. Phase one high school students are those in specific special education and Career Technology Education (CTE) programs. Juniors and seniors are in phase two, and freshmen and sophomores are in phase three. However, among Blair parents, MCPS Board of Education members and Blair students, there is disagreement about who should return to school first, or if students should return to school at all if COVID-19 cases continue to rise.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Senior Celeste Bohn is eager to return to school. On a normal day of online learning, Bohn rolls out of bed and logs onto her first class. From there she goes from class to class until lunch where she usually cooks herself a meal or picks something up to get out of the house. After lunch, Bohn continues on with her afternoon classes. Being online all day exhausts Bohn, so she usually takes a nap after school before getting back online to do homework.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Junior Anika Dabari also has a tiring day. Dabari starts with school, but Darbari’s day doesn’t end after that, she usually has some type of meeting and then homework and studying, so her day doesn’t end until 10:00 p.m. Dabari spends her whole school day on screens then stays on screens to conduct her meetings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bohn believes she does better with in person learning compared to online schooling. “Online learning is harder for me because I’m very extroverted. [I also] like seeing my peers in person and Zoom conversations don’t feel as genuine,” Bohn says. “It is also hard for me to be motivated. I also like the set routine of in person school and I find it easier to not get distracted.” Although she would rather return to school, she believes the county should prioritize the health and safety of students and teachers.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Similar to Bohn, Dabari feels a lack of motivation when it comes to online school. “There’s no barrier between school and home. It’s hard to feel like there’s any break time, plus it’s hard to find motivation because of how weird everything is. Even though my grades have stayed the same I don’t feel like any material is sticking in my mind,” Darbari says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, both students do not think they should be the first to go back if MCPS reopens this January. “I think younger grades like elementary-middle school students should go back first because those years are imperative to social development and having social interaction might be helpful. It might also help them engage more,” Bohn explains. Dabari believes that seniors should have priority when school reopens. “[Seniors] have little high school experience left,” Darbari explains. Both Dabari and Bohn agree that special education students should also be prioritized because they would benefit the most from the resources in-person school has to offer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Similar to Dabari and Bohn, sophomore Eleanore Moose finds it harder to absorb information she is learning in her online classes, and feels as if she is not learning as much as she would in person. “</span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">I am very easily distracted and I don’t absorb as much information as I would in an environment tailored to class. Also it is so much harder to get work done because class time doesn’t allow the ease of asking questions or individually checking with teachers like in person [allows],” Moose says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While Dabari believes seniors should be the first group to go back, others such as Senior Liyu Egege believe freshmen should be moved from phase three where they are now to phase two as one of the first groups of students without special needs to go back. Egege notes that these groups would benefit the most from in-person learning. “Special education and freshmen students should go back to school first. It seems like they’d need the most attention academically and just generally,” Egege says</span><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">Blair students aren’t the only ones with opinions on the reopening plan. MCPS is looking for parent’s input regarding reopening schools. Blair parent Alyse Cohen notes that the group to go back first should be students that will benefit the most from the educational and emotional resources in-person schooling has to offer. “The proposal that is out there now is trying to prioritize students whose education is at greatest risk by not coming back and I totally support that,” Cohen says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">All of these decisions rely on Maryland&nbsp;COVID-19 cases lowering at a certain test positivity rate over a 14-day period. Cohen believes strongly that health and safety must be prioritized when planning to reopen; however, Cohen notes that MCPS could consider alternative ways to bring back students most at risk. “It is my understanding that in some school systems, small groups of students are coming back in bubbles and wearing masks even if they are doing online school to get the assistance of teachers, and especially for students who are at risk of not graduating or losing a lot of the progress they've made there should be some examination of how to do that in a COVID safe way,” Cohen says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(38, 38, 38);">There are mixed opinions on the MCPS reopening plan, but none of it is possible without a significant decrease in COVID-19 cases. Maryland is far away from a test positivity rate at which it would be safe for students to return to in-person schooling. This reopening plan is tentative and subject to change, as parents give input and COVID-19 cases continue to rise. Already, MCPS has pushed the reopening date from Feb.1 to Mar. 15. On Feb. 23, MCPS will meet again to determine if this new date is safe.</span></p>	33237
31921	How senior Wilbert Mora found his love for volunteering and what kept him going	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Most students earn the 75 Student Service Learning (SSL) hours required for high school graduation and stop there. Others might aim to get 260 hours for a purple tassel on their graduation cap. But none of that compares to senior Wilburt Mora's 2076 SSL hours and counting.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Getting this remarkable number of hours was no easy feat for Mora. He started young, volunteering at his former elementary school the summer going into sixth grade. While Mora initially wanted to spend his summers relaxing, his mother insisted he find a way to stay busy, "Right before fifth grade finished, my mother was like 'I don't want you in my house', so I had to find something. And what better place to do service than the school I previously went to?" Mora says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31920"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mora found the long days of volunteerings tiresome, but helpful in learning to stick to a routine schedule. "It would start at 8 o'clock and I would leave around 2 p.m. or 3:30 p.m. It would be like a work schedule but I didn't get paid," Mora explains.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span>After that summer, Mora grew into the habit of volunteering both during the summer and the school year. He began to stack up more SSL hours every year. "By the time I came to high school, I had close to 1000 SSL hours, and every year since, I've gained at least 250. This year alone, I've gained over 500 SSL hours," Mora explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While Mora received many SSL hours for his service, he has often felt undervalued as a volunteer. "People would expect me to be there, so sometimes teachers had backlash when I wasn't present. But at the end of the time when I would be helping out, they wouldn't say thank you, and that got kind of annoying over time," Mora explains.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, volunteering has given Mora benefits as well. His teachers often help him out with finding jobs and informing him of scholarships. It has also helped Mora gain a greater understanding of what he is capable of. "I'm able to be more responsible because I've had to do multiple things by myself and learn what I have to do for myself to move forward," Mora says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This past year, Mora has focused less on SSL hours and more on his role as Blair's SGA president. He helped with the academy rebranding, lending a hand to academy coordinator Amanda Wall. "I don't know if I would have been able to accomplish everything without his help. He's been instrumental in me being successful this year as academy coordinator because he's been there to help me through every single event," Wall says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As Mora's senior year came to a close, he received an award recognizing his hard work volunteering from Senator Van Hollen and another from Blair for having the most SSL hours in the school.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This summer, Mora is attempting to get a job instead of volunteering, since SSL hours will have no meaningful value once he graduates high school. He is especially motivated to get hired since he hopes to save money for college. "I don't need SSL hours, but to get a well-paying job and make sure that I have enough money to go to college," Mora says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Before Mora leaves Blair, he has one piece of advice for students aiming to earn many SSL hours. "Know that it can be fun along the way, but don't go overboard. Sometimes you do so much work, you think you need at least a thank you and you won't get it, so don't get too close to whatever you do," Mora explains. He hopes that students won't only stack up large amounts of hours, but also appreciate the experience without becoming overwhelmed. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Overall, Mora enjoyed his time volunteering and doesn't regret it. "It's taught me a lot about myself and what I'm capable of doing," he says. Mora hopes others will be able to have that same positive experience volunteering in the future.</span></p>	31920
33637	The sequel of Barnes' best-selling book surpasses expectations	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Packed with mind-boggling mysteries and constant suspense, Young Adult writer Jennifer Lynn Barnes's "The Hawthorne Legacy" upholds her reputation as an innovative and creative author. Released on Sept. 7, "The Hawthorne Legacy" is the sequel to Barnes's </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">New York Times</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> best-selling novel, "The Inheritance Games". Her new novel, with all its puzzles and unanswered questions, is an even bigger hit than its predecessor. "The Hawthorne Legacy" had a debut week almost </span><a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/87397-this-week-s-bestsellers-september-20-2021.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">eight times</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> as strong as the series' first novel.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While Barnes is best known for her writing, she is also a psychology professor at the University of Oklahoma. In a </span><a href="https://thenerddaily.com/jennifer-lynn-barnes-hawthorne-legacy-interview/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Q&amp;A interview</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, Barnes describes herself as a "psychology professor by day and a writer by night." Her psychology background has helped Barnes to craft the perplexing puzzles and surprising storylines that make her writing so captivating.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The series centers around Avery Grambs, a typical high school student. Grambs’ goals are simple: survive high school and find a way to pay for college. However, her uneventful life takes a turn when she finds out she has been left a fortune by deceased billionaire Tobias Hawthorne. Avery becomes famous overnight as her "Cinderella story" makes national news. All her problems seem to be solved, but there is a caveat: Avery does not know why Hawthorne left her the money, or even who he is.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into the eccentric Hawthorne's unique home, which is filled with secrets, from family scandals to passageways. With the occasional help of Hawthorne's four grandsons, brilliant and dangerous half-brothers who are suspicious of the new heiress, Avery unravels what may be the family's greatest scandal, while learning that some people are not who they seem to be.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“The Inheritance Games” ended in a cliffhanger, which is exactly where “The Hawthorne Legacy” picks up. Just as before, the novel kicks off with questions that readers may or may not be able to answer by the story's end. Barnes' psychology background appears as she consistently misdirects the reader&nbsp; and characters with tidbits of truth while the whole story lurks beneath the surface.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the novel, a homeless man Avery used to play chess with turns out to be a Hawthorne and maybe even her blood relation. As Avery and the Hawthorne brothers piece together clues that Tobias Hawthorne left all over the country, they uncover long-buried family secrets, from paternity information and love affairs to a tragic teenage "accident," all while escaping threats from family rivals and greedy relatives.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the story's plot revolves around an unusual puzzle-loving old man, it is no surprise that the novel contains a lot of puzzles, including invisible ink messages, riddles, and word play. Though Barnes intends for the audience to be young adults, many of the puzzles are too difficult for the average mind to understand. Unfortunately, sometimes readers just have to shrug off a confusing puzzle and follow the plot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yet while all the anagrams and hidden keys may seem far too convoluted for the average teenager, Barnes manages to keep up with the younger generation with games such as "Drink or Dare," an adult version of the popular game Truth or Dare that replaces the truth option with alcohol consumption, that Barnes presents in an appropriate manner.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One aspect that sets Barnes apart from many other authors is her avoidance of luck. Typically, the protagonists are saved the moment they were meant to die or slip through Death's hands often through pure luck. In "The Inheritance Games", characters are saved by pure intellect, either quick thinking or prior planning. There are no scenes readers can scoff at and say would never be possible in real life.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even with all the competition and rivalries occurring within the Hawthorne family, Barnes explores the strength of the bonds between family members, despite how messy the Hawthorne family is. So although brotherly feelings seem nonexistent as the half-brothers challenge each other to bloody duels, it is clear that at the end of the day, if someone in the family needs help, everyone else will drop whatever they are doing for the family. Even Avery, who was viewed as a con-woman at first, is accepted by </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">most</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of the family as they help her piece together her past. And as Barnes ends the tale with yet another cliffhanger, readers cannot help but wonder what's next.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33636

I have learned about the array of issues affecting our students and schools is vast and constantly evolving. Staying current is constant work.

I’ve learned that every one of our school communities is a rich and diverse pool of talent, expertise, and knowledge that too often MCPS just doesn’t substantively engage</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">in either the policy-making or problem-solving process</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">and that is a huge missed opportunity.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But the most important thing I’ve learned is that our students are THE best barometer for how MCPS is doing as a school system. Our students are the deepest well of knowledge about every aspect of our schools and any issue we face. If we want to make MCPS the best it can be, we have to make partnering with students simply the way we do business.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The daily lived experience of our students in our schools should inform every decision we make for pragmatic reasons</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">—</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">because students know things that no one else knows. But perhaps more importantly, it’s essential that we routinely engage students to work with us to improve our schools because they have become, unequivocally, the moral compass of MCPS.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">MCPS has had “equity” as a core value for many years. Board Policy FAA, Educational Facilities Planning, specifies the process by which the Board makes decisions about an array of facility utilization issues, including the selection of new school sites, boundary changes, school closures, and consolidations. The policy has existed since 1986, been revised several times, and has included requiring the consideration of four co-equal factors (student demographics, geographic proximity, stability of school assignments over time, facility utilization) in making these types of decisions at least since the 1990s.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Policy FAA has for </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">decades</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> included creating a “diverse student body” as one of four co-equal factors to be considered when establishing school boundaries or determining where to build or expand schools.

MCPS has benefited from an uninterrupted series of Student Members of the Board of Education (SMOBs) (Eric Guerci, Matthew Post, Ananya Tadikonda, Nathaniel Tinbite) standing up and calling for MCPS to do</span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"> </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">and be better.

33611	Blair outshine an undefeated Rockville in a highlight-filled performance	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Oct. 8, The Blazers (5-1) clutched up at home against the formerly undefeated Rockville Rams (5-1) with a final score of 42-31. Rockville had trouble containing Blair’s superb offensive performance and allowed the Blazer to clinch a Homecoming nailbiter. Blair remains in the 3rd-place spot of the 4A division.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair came into the first half determined to dominate the Rams, yet the Rams' offense managed to outshine the Blazers early on with a smooth 2-yard rushing touchdown making the score 7-0. Senior Blazer defensive end Keshav Mehta-Harwits described the energy on the field after that play as nerve-wracking. “[The energy] was tense, but since our team is so set on winning we turned that energy into wanting that dub’ more,” Mehta-Harwits said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But the Blazer defense responded with their first big defensive stop on the Rams’ second possession by sacking the quarterback. “We needed that sack; it definitely hyped up our offense,” Mehta-Harwits said</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On their second possession, Blazers’ junior quarterback Kendall Anderson turned it up with an electric QB rush with over 3 minutes left in the first quarter. Immediately afterward, Anderson threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Mikhail Seiken to tie the score at 7-7.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers' defense, inspired by their offense’s sensational plays, came out with a vengeance to end the first quarter. Every play Rockville attempted was read and stopped by the Blazer’s great defense.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During the second quarter, Rockville seemed to realize that they were an undefeated team. They scored their second touchdown by keeping the ball in the air the entire drive, ending with a 42-yard touchdown pass to make the score 13-7.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After an unsuccessful possession, the Blazers got the ball right back in their hands thanks to an interception by Seiken. While the Blair student section erupted in cheers, junior receiver Jamall Worrell caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from Anderson to give the Blazers a 14-13 lead. The Blazer offense managed to capitalize on offense one more time in the first half by closing out with a 7-yard rush by junior running back Arnauld Tegrom for a touchdown, making the score 21-13.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers continued their electric offensive performance into the third quarter with two excellent runs. Senior running back Michael Dinkel topped off the possession with a 1-yard rushing touchdown resulting in a 28-13 score.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rockville’s third-quarter performance was sloppy on both sides of the field. Their quarterback tried to complete a huge pass, but it was picked off by senior cornerback Andy Merrill.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After the turnover, Blair’s offense looked unstoppable when making a spectacular 77-yard touchdown catch by Seiken. But Seiken’s great game doesn’t come as a surprise to him. “This is expected considering how hard my team and I work,” Seiken stated.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With the Blazers pulling away from the Rams with a 35-13 score, the Rams began minimizing the mistakes that had taken the ball out of their hands. They were making smarter offensive decisions; and made the last touchdown of the third quarter with an explosive 47-yard pass, making the score 35-19.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rockville continued their performance in the fourth quarter and managed to pull off a little comeback against the Blazers. The Rams blocked Blair’s kick return and gave themselves a start at the 3-yard line.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Rockville’s quarterback came out with more energy, starting the possession with a QB rush. Although Rockville focused on their ground game for the drive, they surprised the Blazers’ defense with a 9-yard pass into the endzone, bringing the score to 35-25.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It began to look like Rockville could pull off a miracle on the Boulevard and bring the game back. With over seven minutes left on the clock, Rockville needed to continue their outstanding offensive performance. They were able to finish their drive with a 30-yard touchdown pass to make the score 35-31, and it became up to Blair to stop the Rams’ roll.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When the Blazer offense got the ball back, the pressure was high. And it was even higher during the third down, Anderson fumbled the snap, allowing the defense to swarm him. But right before he was sacked, he heaved the ball for a jaw-dropping nearly 40-yard completion to Worrell, who had a phenomenal moss over the Rams’ defense. After a few more runs, the Blazer offense dashed any hope of a Rockville comeback with a 4-yard rush touchdown by Dinkel to make the score 42-31.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Head Blazer coach Samual Nosoff commented on the team’s ability to stay in the game despite Rockville’s effort in the fourth quarter. “We’ve done a lot of work this offseason with getting better mentally [and] turning things back on when we need to. I knew that at some point we were going to get back to what we were doing,” Nosoff said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Nosoff also acknowledged the importance of the Homecoming game and how the team came into the game with determination to win. “We needed this, this student section needed this, the community needed this and we had a bunch of alumni. Everyone really needed a game where we perform on both offense and defense,” Nosoff said. </span></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/2021-homecoming-football-game-blair-vs-rockville-33592/" target="_blank"><em>Check out a </em></a><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/2021-homecoming-football-game-blair-vs-rockville-33592/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><em>gallery of photos from Cal Tobias, a writer for Silver Chips Print and freelance photographer, here</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</em></p>	33599
32784	MCPS continues to provide support and education to the community through the COVID-19 pandemic	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The critical role that schools play in the lives of students, families and communities has become obvious as that role has been threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. As Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) closed, they were forced to address the responsibility that they have to provide necessities, such as meals and technology, to thousands of students across the county. For those who depend on schools for their everyday needs, school closures present many difficulties.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In order to address the need for food in the community, MCPS has set up meal distribution stations across the county where two meals per day are accessible to people ages eighteen and under. At Blair, one of over forty distribution locations, staff from the school along with other volunteers distribute meals between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. everyday. The distribution site, which is run by Blair cafeteria manager Christine Blanton, runs like a well-oiled machine. The staff are ready with plastic bags of food which is then delivered to cars that pull up, limiting contact between families and the staff. Blanton put an emphasis on their efforts to maintain cleanliness at the site. “We have gloves, we have hand sanitizer,” she said. “They switch up every ten minutes and change gloves and put hand sanitizer on their hands.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As the county has transitioned to alternative forms of education, they have expressed their desire to ensure that their distance learning is as equitable as possible. In order to enable online learning, MCPS has passed out Chromebooks and mobile Wi-Fi hotspot devices alongside the daily meals. In a letter from the MCPS superintendent Jack Smith, he said that the digital devices “will help ensure our students can fully engage in this new model” and that “these devices will be prioritized for students in need.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Regardless of MCPS’ valiant efforts to make distance learning effective and equitable, it has proven impossible to match in-person education. With no guarantee that every student has the adequate resources and environment to complete normal school work, the county limited teachers to only two additional grades for marking period three. As the prospect of long-term distance learning becomes more of a reality, MCPS will have to continue to engineer ways to ensure equitable learning as well as provide students and families with daily necessities.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32785
32783	A pass/fail system unfairly rewards students for doing the bare minimum	<p>On March 29, Joel Shapiro started a petition to Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) requesting "that MCPS moves our grading system to a Pass/Fail system rather than the traditional letter-grade system" in light of the COVID-19 crisis, citing student stress as the main reason.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32782"></div><p>Pass/fail grading systems are often used by colleges, especially to give students an opportunity to take courses that they might not be as familiar with. For example, a biology major might want to take an art course, but not want to have to worry about a bad grade affecting their GPA. A pass/fail grading system would give them that opportunity. However, there is no need for a pass/fail system among high schoolers, who don't have an area of expertise.</p><p>Many students strongly oppose transitioning to this system. "Pass fail is a bad thing if you want to get into a good college," junior Conrad Bohn commented on a post advertising the petition. He is not without reason. A poll published by the National Center for Biotechnology Information examines how being in a pass/fail grading system versus a traditional grading system impacts medical students' acceptance into a residency program. The poll found that a pass/fail system negatively affects a student's chances. "Eighty-one percent of program directors believed that the medical student's ability to compete for a residency position was adversely influenced by the pass/fail method of evaluation," the abstract explained.</p><p>This was due to the fact that program directors preferred a grading system that provided "more objective data." In other words, it's difficult to compare a candidate who received a "pass," which typically could range anywhere from a 60 to a 100, with a candidate who received an "A," which is typically in the 90 to 100 range.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, transitioning to a pass/fail system could hurt students' GPAs, further harming them in the college application process. Traditionally, passing grades are not factored into a student's GPA. Students who were relying on having this semester to improve their GPA would suddenly have that opportunity taken away from them if MCPS were to switch to a pass/fail system. Not to mention that there are also seniors who rely on certain GPAs to get scholarships from colleges.</p><p>Moreover, a pass/fail system unfairly rewards students for doing the bare minimum. "Those who get a 65 shouldn't be given the same reward as those who put in the work for a 95," Bohn said in his comment. A pass/fail grading system encourages students to do just enough work for a class to pass, and then acknowledges them in the same way as students who put maximum effort into the same course.&nbsp;</p><p>In remote learning scenarios like the one that MCPS currently finds itself in, the traditional grading system incentivizes students to continue to put in effort and work hard. It holds students accountable when teachers aren't able to do so to the extent that they can in a regular classroom setting.</p><p>If MCPS truly wants for its students to get the most out of a class, then they can't switch to a pass/fail system. Not only does it encourage and reward minimal effort, but it can also have negative impacts on students' chances in the college application process. It is unfair to hardworking students who consistently put their all into school to have that chance taken away from them.</p><p><br></p>	32782

Surpassing 57 million views by 8 a.m. on the day of its release, the music video doesn't lie when it promises to "pull you in like no other."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The group continues to break their own world records with their new release. For one, the music video reached 1 million likes 40 minutes </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">before</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> the song's release at midnight, and became the quickest YouTube video to reach 1 million likes, beating their first English release, "Dynamite," by 48 minutes. The music video also passed 100 million views in 20 hours and 54 minutes, again beating the previous global record holder, "Dynamite," which stood at 24 hours.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Following "Dynamite," a colorful disco-pop track released in the summer of 2020, "Butter" opens with a black-and-white color filter and a more refined - yet stylish - aesthetic. BTS' youngest member, Jungkook, opens the single once again, clad in a black suit that replaces his messy room and boyish style from the last English release.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33435"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The simple, percussive baseline and sharp fashion choices show fans a sleek and classy performance style. But BTS returns to their playful side for the second chorus as they show off another '70s-inspired choreography while wearing vivid and bright tracksuits in a bright gymnasium. Addicting synthesizer solos rise to the melody for a disco-ball elevator dance break (whew!) that features each of the seven members. BTS' talented rapline covers the bridge and leads a charismatic call-and-response (while the vocalists go ham on the ad libs).</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The song also brings attention to ARMY, the popular fandom of the boy group – well-known for raising one million dollars for the BLM movement, as co-writer and band member RM recognizes them in his rap verse with the lyric, "got ARMY right behind us when we say so" – the first ever mention of the fandom in a BTS song. The lyric trended on Twitter alongside the hashtags #butterworldwideparty, #buttermv, and #itssogood, as the supportive fans excitedly tweeted about their favorite parts of the song.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Like "Dynamite," "Butter" references Michael Jackson once again – specifically his popular song Smooth Criminal in the first verse of the song. The song further alludes to Usher's U Got It Bad when vocalist Taehyung sings that he doesn't need Usher to remind fans that they've "got it bad" – thanks for the reminder, Taehyung.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The song's smooth vocals and refreshing choreography are easy on the ears and eyes – a perfect recipe to please their global fandom. BTS' choice to release another summer hit with English-only lyrics and references to Western pop-culture demonstrates their dedication to their global stage. "The way we think is that everything that we do, and our existence itself, is contributing to the hope for leaving this xenophobia, these negative things, behind. It’s our hope, too, that people in the minority will draw some energy and strength from our existence," says BTS member RM to </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/new-bts-song-2021-worlds-biggest-band-1166441/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Rolling Stone</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The happy and bright vibes are perfect for vacation as the school year comes to a close, setting the scene for an exciting summer with "Butter" on repeat. BTS has once again "melted our heart into two," and we're excited to see what their next album, scheduled to release later in the summer, will bring.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Now, the only question left is – how did J-Hope manage to eat a full slice of butter at the end of the music video?</span></p>	33435
32906	MLB has had a tumultuous few months	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32905"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A salary dispute during a pandemic and economic crisis. Players and entire teams testing positive for COVID-19. It is safe to say Major League Baseball (MLB) has had a tumultuous few months. MLB and Commissioner Rob Manfred’s handling of these issues has painted an ugly picture of the sport and will likely result with problems down the road.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When the season was suspended until further notice in March due to COVID-19, a salary dispute between the owners (MLB) and the players union (MLBPA) began. The owners attempted to redact players’ salaries to make up for the financial repercussions of the pandemic. The MLBPA did not take kindly to this and neither did the owners when the players pushed back. Several players began publicly criticizing the owners and even complaining about how much money they were losing, even though the </span><a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/the-average-mlb-player-gets-4-4-million-a-year/article_35d2d9a0-e5c8-5fea-88d0-0c00314ae81a.html#:~:text=Major%20League%20Baseball's%20average%20salary,contracts%20by%20The%20Associated%20Press." target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">average player salary</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is 4.4 million dollars. The dispute ended in June when Rob Manfred imposed a 60-game season.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is absurd as well as tone deaf that a group of millionaires and billionaires publicly disputed money, especially during a time of record high unemployment rates. Neither side was in danger of unemployment or poverty. It is a slap in the face to fans as well as those who are unemployed and/or poor. </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/193645/revenue-of-major-league-baseball-teams-in-2010/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">MLB franchises</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> generate millions annually in revenue, so it is difficult to understand the greed and selfishness coming from them when everything else is also suffering.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This dispute proved greed controls baseball. Players and owners clearly did not care about how their actions affected anyone besides themselves, no matter how tone deaf they were. This was frustrating as a fan because there could have been more baseball to enjoy during a rough time in America. The game could have reversed recent popularity trends if it had started earlier, which would have benefited the league. Instead, the nation was disappointed when MLB argued with the MLBPA about money during what would have normally been the first half of the season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Eventually, Rob Manfred stepped in and imposed the 60-game season. The season has barely started, yet there are already problems related to COVID-19. Multiple teams and players have complained about tests taking too long to come back, which has sidelined some players. Many players have tested positive, and the </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/us/mlb-miami-marlins-coronavirus-spt-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Miami Marlins'</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> season has been temporarily paused because of an outbreak within the team. Nationals star outfielder Juan Soto, who tested positive hours before opening night, had to wait over a day to be cleared to return by MLB despite </span><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/nationals-juan-soto-frustrated-over-mlb-covid-19-testing-protocols/ar-BB17hOuw?li=BBnb7Kz" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">testing negative</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> six times. The required number of negative tests to return to play is two. Some of the rules put into effect by the league to maintain social distancing are not being followed by some players.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Commissioner and players alike are capable of providing a safer environment than the one currently being experienced. Preventing COVID-19 so there can be a season is a task that requires everyone’s cooperation. The consequences of breaking the league’s social distancing protocols have already taken place, as </span><a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/nationals/marlins-players-reportedly-went-out-atlanta-covid-19-outbreak" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Marlins players</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> allegedly went out in Atlanta. Four other teams experienced disruptions in their schedules because of the Marlins’ foolishness, while at least seventeen Marlins members tested positive for COVID-19. If this continues to happen, there will not be a season for much longer. Commissioner Manfred needs to impose punishments upon anyone who breaks the rules. A system similar to the NBA, where players or staff can anonymously report anyone who breaks the rules, could be effective for baseball. If the Marlins report is true, there should be a fine against the players that snuck out. Repeat offenders should be suspended for the rest of the season by Manfred. Going out for one’s benefit is not worth putting the health of others at risk.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite a salary dispute and a COVID-19 outbreak that could have cancelled the season, baseball is underway. It is important that the league ensures players are keeping each other safe because it is in the best interests for everyone. If everything goes right, baseball could quickly change its image back into a positive one. MLB will help its image if it successfully holds the 2020 season without more disruptions. The salary dispute can permanently become a thing of the past if players and owners decide to agree upon what is best for everyone. It will take work, but MLB can right its wrongs in a short amount of time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32905

This album hits close to Blazers and alumni: it focuses on Hutchinson’s experiences growing up in Takoma Park and attending Blair in the 90s. In just 33 minutes, Hutchinson successfully captures some of the greatest emotions that students encounter over the four years of high school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32889"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Upon listening to the album for the first time, two things are crystal clear: high school is rough, but it also hasn’t changed that much since 1998. Peer pressure filled friendships, first time relationships, and feeling lost are shared themes in most people’s high school experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The album opener, “Rock Out Tonight,” centers on an angsty, danger-craving teenager looking to have fun without knowing exactly how. Hutchinson name checks his 1990 Ford Taurus and Rockville Pike, the spot where the cool kids seemed to hang out at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In contrast, “Drunk at Lunch” and “Cooler Than You” tackle what it really means to be a cool high schooler. “Drunk at Lunch” addresses feeling out of place when all your friends are drinking, but you don’t want to. Hutchinson remembers having an open lunch at the old Blair, and his friends decided it would be cool to go to an upperclassman’s house and drink screwdrivers in his grandmother’s basement one day.&nbsp;“That was really confusing to me because I felt like I wasn't getting it or like I didn't know how to have fun,” Hutchinson said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In “Cooler Than You,” Hutchinson’s 20 years of new perspective shines through. He sings, “You may win today but when I think it through / Nobody knows it yet / But I am cooler than you.” Hutchinson looks back to correct some of the misconceptions he held about life. “High school is a really important part of life, but it's not all of life. And it's in the end, it's only four years of my life, which is, you know, the older I get a smaller and smaller portion. So it's, I think there's life after high school,” he said. This is embodied on the song, which wisely puts forth that struggles in high school will lead to future success.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As for high school romance, Hutchinson admits that he was “girl crazy.” This was his inspiration behind “Lovely Lori,” which starts as an ode to one girl named Lori, but then brings in Jamie, Melissa, Marissa, Stephanie, Amanda, Anna, Nicola, Gina, Tina, Tiffany, and many more. “ I was in love with any girl that would show even the smallest amount of interest in me...I just bounced around from one girl to the next until somebody would say, ‘yes, I'll go on a date with you,’ or whatever,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Anne Marie” is another song on the album about a girl, but this time she’s dating Hutchinson’s friend, Matthew Vanderwhite. With a humorous and sarcastic spin, Hutchinson shines a spotlight on the craziness of relationships in high school that everyone goes through in some capacity. Most of the names he included in the songs were actually people he knew back in high school, which adds another layer of authenticity and relatability to the music.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hutchinson credits his open mindedness and musical start to living in Montgomery County and being a part of the CAP Program at Blair. He noted that he dislikes high school movies, which are widely stereotypical, specifically because they don’t feel like Blair.&nbsp;“There wasn’t the prom king and queen, and there wasn’t the quarterback of the football team. It wasn’t so cut and dry. It was like you could be really popular in one hallway, but then I would go over one hallway and everyone’s speaking Vietnamese and they don’t give a damn about what I want to do or what I like. There was something really grounding about all of it,” Hutchinson said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As for music, Hutchinson first started learning how to play the guitar in his freshman year of high school.&nbsp;He used to skip lunch and sneak into the band room, where he would spend time learning songs or playing songs for a friend he brought with him. The creativity within the CAP program also fueled Hutchinson’s passion for music. “Maybe my friends don't want to get high and get drunk; maybe they want to make something we can actually listen to later and be proud of,” he recalls thinking. This gave Hutchinson something constructive to do with his friends, and ultimately turned into his livelihood.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32891"></div><p><br></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Class of 98 </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">was a fun album for Hutchinson to make, sending him back to his high school days, remembering his peers and reflecting on how his life has changed since then. “In a lot of ways I like high school better now when I don't actually have to be going through it,” Hutchinson said. Hutchinson normalizes the struggles of high school and offers his own insight within the album. “I hope if you've had a difficult time, you'll keep going and figure something else out. And if you loved high school, congratulations, you're going to probably love everything,” he added.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">As a member of the last graduating class of the old Blair, Hutchinson also believes he shares something in common with the class of 2020, whose senior year got cut short due to COVID-19. “We sort of graduated and then the thing kind of just evaporated...there's something weird about the fact that we couldn't ever go back to the school that we all went to. So there was something kind of intense about leaving Blair around then as well,” Hutchinson said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The July 10 release is extra special because the album has already been pushed back twice. The original release, set for April 17, was pushed back to June 12 due to COVID-19. Hutchinson made the decision to postpone the album once more to keep focus on the Black Lives Matter movement.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="ql-indent-1"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“In the wake of everything that has been going on with the #BlackLivesMatter protests and movement, I’ve been </span> <span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">reflecting on how fortunate I was to grow up in Takoma Park and Silver Spring. I’ve already been doing a lot of thinking about high school and my formative years, and I’ve been reminded of just how diverse, vibrant and multi-cultural our community was and is, and what a gift it is to be given the opportunities and exposure that Montgomery County affords. Blair is a special place and I’m more proud of being a Blazer than ever,” Hutchinson said at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Class of 98</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> is available to stream and purchase today. If you’ve ever been in high school, this is definitely one album worth checking out. “I’m hoping there's some sort of commonality in that, no matter when you went to high school, if you listen to this, it feels like high school,” Hutchinson said. And it does. Hutchinson’s memories are relatable and his advice echoes throughout: “just live your best life, be kind to people and try not to regret anything.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32889
32777	Northwestern HS counselor and basketball coach has died from the coronavirus	<p>Terrance Burke, a counselor, Navy veteran, and basketball coach for Northwestern High School, passed away on March 27 as a result of COVID-19.

31758	Montgomery County appropriated 123.36 million dollars to expand Northwood High School	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Over the course of the next six years, Montgomery County will fund an expansion project for Northwood High School to increase the building's student capacity from 1,500 to 2,700 seats. According to </span><a href="https://apps.montgomerycountymd.gov/BASISCAPITAL/Common/Project.aspx?ID=P651907" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) </a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">projections, the project will be completed in 2024, two years after the school is expected to exceed its population capacity. This reflects a broader trend of overpopulation prevalent throughout MCPS. Walter Johnson, Poolesville, Gaithersburg, Kennedy and Montgomery Blair High School are also estimated to surpass their current student capacity limit within the next decade. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The population of Montgomery County has been steadily increasing ever since 2008 and the implications of this expand beyond tangible problems such as space and building size. While the number of students in MCPS has increased, the rate of new teachers hired has not risen proportionally. This has resulted in the average class size increasing by </span><a href="https://apps.montgomerycountymd.gov/BASISCAPITAL/Common/Project.aspx?ID=P651907" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">7.49 students from the 2017-2018 school year to present day</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.&nbsp;Blair junior Yenny Jiron reflects on how class size has affected her education. "Teachers are overwhelmed with students so there is a lack of one on one time. I find myself hating even days because in my eighth period there are around 40 students. The class is exhausting," Jiron described. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Studies have shown that larger class sizes have an effect on the quality of education students are receiving. Research by the 2015</span><a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/research/featured/the-class-size-debate-what-the-evidence-means-for-education-policy" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);"> Public Policy Department at Berkeley University</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> revealed that the average student in a small classroom (15-20 students) has a reading and math score nearly nine percent higher than a student in a medium-sized class (20-26 students). </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The study also indicated that the problem is magnified for low-income and minority students, a large part of the Northwood and Blair populations. This problem is highlighted through the experiences of many Blair students. "In English class in freshman year, there were around 33 students in my class. The teacher had office hours, but in class it was hard to talk to him because there was always another student with him. This made me struggle and made it harder to receive the grade I wanted in the class," Blair Senior Zakariya Gordon said. Gordon also elaborated on how larger class sizes exacerbate the achievement gap already prevalent in MCPS. "I feel like minorities are inherently less likely to ask for help because they already feel like they can't understand material or they feel like they already won't be successful," Gordon stated.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31726"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Montgomery County's expansion of Northwood will prevent the school's population from exceeding its capacity limit. However, it is unlikely to solve many of the nuanced problems concerning the education of its students. Northwood Senior Molly Kramer reflects on the school's construction. "I'm happy I'm graduating because the additions to my school won't be as beneficial as people think. Overpopulation is just one of the many problems at Northwood, it's the quality of education that's the problem and [the] two are mutually exclusive," she explained. Northwood's physical expansion only addresses half the problem. Overpopulated classrooms are prevalent throughout MCPS and hiring new teachers is the only way to instill an effective and personalized education for all students. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31726
32896	Naughty Dog’s sequel to 2013’s “The Last of Us” rises above controversy and represents a major step forward for video game storytelling	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Naughty Dog’s “The Last of Us Part II,” released June 19, is one of the more controversial video game releases in recent memory. Critics hail the game as a masterpiece, while fans attack it as ruining the franchise and its characters. While “The Last of Us Part II” is not without flaws, it is a worthy successor to “The Last of Us.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“The Last of Us Part II” takes place more than four years after the events of “The Last of Us” in which a smuggler named Joel is hired to take an immune girl named Ellie across the country to a hospital amidst a viral pandemic. Along the way, the two develop a father-daughter bond and when they reach the hospital, Joel learns in order to make a cure from Ellie’s immunity to the virus, she would have to die. Joel instead kills dozens of people to save her and then lies to her, saying that no one is looking for a cure. When “The Last of Us Part II” begins, Joel and Ellie have escaped to a community in Jackson, Wyoming.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Similar to its predecessor, exploration is an essential part of gameplay, giving players large and detailed areas to search for resources, weaponry and collectibles. Unlike “The Last of Us,” however, “The Last of Us Part II” is exponentially larger, allowing for more extensive exploration of locales like snow-covered Wyoming and post-apocalyptic Seattle. As players search these areas to find resources and other trinkets, they will gain a deeper understanding of the world “The Last of Us Part II” takes place in.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32895"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The other aspect of gameplay are “encounters,” where players are placed in large areas with numerous enemies trying to kill them. Players can choose melee combat, gunplay, stealth, all of the above or none of the above to complete these.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The gameplay in “The Last of Us” gave players freedom to choose how they complete encounters and “The Last of Us Part II” improves that concept. By giving players more space and new ways to hide in and traverse through it, “The Last of Us Part II” increases the ways players can complete them.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But, encounters can grow repetitive. This isn’t unique to “The Last of Us Part II,” as most games can be monotonous as they progress. The game is also grotesquely violent, as players regularly find themselves blowing off limbs with shotguns or smashing enemy faces with bats covered in blades, and this gruesomeness can make it difficult to find the fun as the game progresses.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">But for whenever its gameplay falters, “The Last of Us Part II” delivers a narrative so engrossing and compelling nitpicks about the gameplay disappear.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In “The Last of Us Part II,” Ellie is the main playable character. After a “violent and traumatizing event,” to quote the game’s director Neil Druckmann, Ellie embarks on a journey for vengeance. Both the presentation and story implications of this event on possible future “The Last of Us” titles have infuriated fans and caused much of the controversy surrounding the game.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">It’s easy to sympathize with those upset about the event, as it’s deeply emotional and hard to watch. But it shouldn’t keep fans from playing the game, because while the narrative isn’t perfect, it’s still engaging and well written, with exceptional performances from the entire cast.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Naughty Dog blends multiple timelines and perspectives to create a story that builds on the original while respecting the old characters fans love. It also creates new stories with new characters that manage to be as compelling as Joel and Ellie in “The Last of Us.” Without spoiling anything, the narrative, characters and themes in “The Last of Us Part II” make it one of the most nuanced video game storylines.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">So, to fans of “The Last of Us” who have yet to play the game but are aware of the fan outrage, they should play the game. And more importantly, the </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">entire </em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">game. Even though it’s hard to play at certain moments, the rest of the game is too good to ignore and its narrative is too important to the franchise’s original characters to simply write off.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32895
33386	Following the rover’s landing last month, the astrobiological project continues on its way as planned	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Feb. 18, NASA’s Perseverance rover touched down on Mars. The rover’s purpose is mostly to gather information and photos of potential past life on Mars, as well as collecting samples of Mars soil.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.space.com/perseverance-rover-mars-2020-mission" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Since landing, Perseverance has since been exploring the vast landscape on Mars</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. It is currently joining the Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars back in 2012 and still continues gathering rock and soil samples. Perseverance’s build is similar to Curiosity’s, and has similar hardware and shape (both vaguely resemble small cars).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, the main difference between Curiosity and Perseverance is that while Curiosity’s job was mostly to determine if Mars was inhabitable, Perseverance’s job is to find evidence of past life on the Red Planet. </span><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25596/perseverance-rovers-first-image-from-mars/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to an article from NASA’s Mars Exploration Program website</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, “The rover will characterize the planet’s geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With seven different instruments designed to collect data and samples, Perseverance is the culmination of years of hard work and the end result of </span><a href="https://www.space.com/perseverance-mars-rover-landing-success" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">NASA’s Mars 2020 mission, with a hefty budget of $2.7 billion.</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> One of the key features is Perseverance’s Hazard Cameras: shortly after landing, Perseverance’s first picture of Mars terrain was captured using one of these cameras and sent to Earth.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33385"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For about a week after landing, Perseverance went through a series of self-checks of its programs, instruments, and software. On Feb. 26, </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-perseverance-drives-on-mars-terrain-for-first-time/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Perseverance conducted a major software update</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that changed its internal software from landing software to investigation software.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On March 2, NASA engineers operated Perseverance’s 7-foot-long robotic arm and ran some final checks to make sure it could operate smoothly. Robert Hogg, who is the Perseverance rover deputy mission manager, explained that this robotic arm was the key to investigating and gathering samples from Mars’ surface. “That’s the main tool the science team will use to do close-up examination of the geologic features of Jezero Crater, and then we’ll drill and sample the ones they find the most interesting,” Hogg explained.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Most recently, </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/05/world/mars-perseverance-rover-first-drive-scn-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Perseverance conducted its first test drive on Mars on March 4</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Two weeks after its landing, the rover finally left its landing site and drove about 21 feet away. This initial drive is usually the most nerve-wracking, since it’s the first time all of the rover’s parts are coming together, and one faulty part could obliterate $2.7 billion of hard work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Fortunately, Perseverance (true to its name) pushed through rocky terrain and successfully completed its first drive. Anais Zarifian, who works as a mobility testbed engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/06/974386021/in-first-test-drive-on-mars-perseverance-rover-makes-a-short-but-significant-tri" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">explained the significance of the successful drive</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. “The rover's six-wheel drive responded superbly. We are now confident our drive system is good to go, capable of taking us wherever the science leads us over the next two years,” Zarifian explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the coming weeks, Perseverance will undergo more checks and tests before finally venturing out and joining Curiosity in the hunt for past Martian life. The mission will last at least one Mars year (about two Earth years) before coming back to Earth. It’s clear to see that NASA scientists and engineers worked extremely hard on Perseverance, and despite the difficulties that COVID-19 might’ve brought to their project, their hard work and perseverance is now paying off. </span></p>	33385
33424	The aftershocks of the surge in violence against the AAPI community.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/17/us/shooting-atlanta-acworth" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">shooting in Atlanta</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> that left eight people, six of whom were Asian women, dead, sophomore Elina Lee was afraid to go for training runs in her Potomac, Md. neighborhood. "My mom… was telling me how I can't go outside by myself anymore [for runs]… I would have to find someone to go with me," Lee says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yoko Zoll, who teaches ESOL and Japanese Language at Blair, finds herself being extra vigilant when she walks around her neighborhood or shops for groceries. "I am very afraid of going out… If somebody approaches, I just go away to make a distance…&nbsp;I have been very carefully paying attention to what other people are doing since the incident in Atlanta," Zoll says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hate crimes against the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community have spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The organization </span><a href="https://stopaapihate.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Stop AAPI Hate</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> reported 3,795 incidents during the first eleven months after the U.S. declared COVID-19 a national emergency (March 19, 2020 to Feb. 28, 2021). Asian American women reported hate incidents over two times more than men, adding to Zoll and Lee's concern for their own safety.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The organization noted that 3,795 is undoubtedly an underrepresentation of the true scale of violence and hate against Asian Americans, since many incidents go unreported. "Most Asians don't report because they don't trust the police… So there should be more numbers. But we tend to just get together to protect ourselves instead of just going public to assert [our] rights," Zoll says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The surge in attacks against Asian Americans was fueled by Anti-Asian racism and xenophobia; a notable example is former president Donald Trump's repeatedly calling the coronavirus the "China virus" in tweets and official press releases. Anti-Asian rhetoric in this country has existed since the first Chinese workers immigrated to the U.S. in the 1850s, but it has exploded this past year with devastating consequences.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even in Montgomery County--which prides itself on its diversity and progressive politics--there is work to be done to stem the hostility against Asian Americans. The stereotypes of the Asian American as the "model minority" and "perpetual foreigner" permeate everyday life.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair math teacher Tung Pham notes how the model minority myth hurts his Asian American students' education. "A lot of people have this expectation for my students like, 'Oh, because they're Asian Americans, they must be smart and must be good at math,' and in fact, they're struggling in the class," he says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33423"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lee, like many Asian American students, lives with the academic pressures that the model minority myth creates. "[It] is really harmful to us because for those of us who don't reach the expectation, we end up disappointing our parents and our mental health suffers because of that. It's also harmful to the people around us because we're expected to do better than them. So if other people ended up doing better than us, they might get accused of cheating or just academic dishonesty," she says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When Lee has a problem with a school assignment, she rarely goes to her teacher first for assistance. "[I] don't try to reach out to get teachers' help most of the time. If it's something small, I would ask my friends first instead of reaching out to the teacher, and I feel like it's a problem," she says. The model minority myth burdens Lee with the expectation to excel in all her classes while discouraging her from seeking support when she needs it.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only does the model minority myth make it more difficult for Asian American students to seek academic support, but it creates division between Asian Americans and other marginalized communities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"There are certain racial stereotypes about how Asian Americans are hardworking and about how they're rich… it's not the case. Even within the Asian American community, there is a large discrepancy and disparity about socioeconomic status… It creates this wedge between minority groups fighting for the same thing, which is [that] we want to be treated equally," Pham says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lee sees a similar challenge with regard to the division that the model minority myth creates between marginalized communities. "When two minorities begin fighting with each other, White supremacy prevails… It would be helpful if we [Asian Americans] could somehow advocate in a way that doesn't step on other movements, but it also brings attention to us," Lee says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This phenomenon that Lee described is known as "last place aversion." To use the analogy of society as a ladder, people have a self-preservation instinct to avoid being on the bottom rung. Those near the bottom jockey for position amongst themselves instead of working together to dismantle the hierarchy itself. This conflict between marginalized groups benefits those who are already at the top of the social hierarchy, strengthening White supremacy.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition to the model minority myth, the stereotype of the "perpetual foreigner" is familiar to many Asian Americans. This can manifest itself in questions like, "Where are you </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">really</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> from?"</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This stereotype paints Asian Americans as the "other," making it easier to justify violence towards them.

32717	Senior night ended in disappointment for Blair as the Jaguars displayed their dominance	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair's boys varsity basketball team (13-6) fell short Friday night against the Northwest Jaguars (8-10), losing their Senior Night game 74-59. Missed opportunities and lack of chemistry lead to a disappointing night for the Blazers who started off the season strong, but have now lost four of their last&nbsp;five games.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Blair’s head coach Damon Pigrom started all four of his seniors, forwards Leon Johnson and Abu-bakarr Bangura and guards Liam Olabagu and Leeroi Boker Jr., along with junior guard Michael Ayala Jr. The starting five started the game strong for Blair, scoring the first four points of the game and taking an early lead. However, the Jaguars did not let the Blazers run away with it. Clawing for the lead, after a couple of free throws the Jaguars tied the game up with five minutes left in the first quarter. The Blazers inched ahead and managed to stay ahead to end the quarter with a 14-10 lead.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32716"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the beginning of the second quarter, Blair continued to fend off Northwest. However, after many missed opportunities and a few turnovers by the Blazers, the Jaguars took the lead with two minutes left in the quarter. One of Northwest’s guards sunk a couple of key threes and helped the Jaguars pull ahead to end the half with a 32-26 lead.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the second half, Northwest began to take command of the game. The Jaguars tightened up their defense and their offense continued to dominate. The Blazers failed to capitalize on opportunities and their defense started to fall apart. By the end of the third quarter, Northwest had climbed to a 53-38 lead. With a similarly disappointing fourth quarter for the Blazers, which included a few untimely turnovers, the Blazers ultimately fell to the Jaguars 74-59.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The team attributed their frustrating Senior Night loss to the lack of teamwork and communication. “Our team chemistry, discipline and effort need to improve,” said junior forward Tommy Waltz-Chesnaye. “They were shooting really well, but that’s no excuse to lose to a team we were better than.” Blair’s rough streak will hopefully subside before their last home game and the playoffs that follow.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers will play their next home game on Friday Feb. 21 against Walt Whitman High School.</em></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32716

Jemison, 62, became the first African American women to travel in space in 1992. Engineer, physician and NASA astronaut, Jemison has received countless awards for her extraordinary accomplishments. Jemison was born in Decatur, Alabama in 1956 and was the youngest child of Charlie Jemison and Dorothy Green. Her father was a maintenance supervisor and her mother was an elementary school teacher. When she was three years old, her family moved to Chicago to seek better opportunities for their children. She dreamed of going to space as a child and spent hours reading books of all aspects of science in the library, especially astronomy.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31716"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When she graduated from high school, she was convinced that she wanted to study biomedical engineering and entered Stanford University on a National Achievement Scholarship.

She began her career at the University of Southern California Medical Center, and afterward, was the Peace Corps medical officer for&nbsp;Sierra Leone and Liberia. But in 1985, she decided to make a dramatic career change to follow her aspiring dream. She applied for admission to NASA's astronaut training and became the first African American woman to be admitted, and in 1992, went into orbit aboard the Space Shuttle </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Endeavour. </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">She made several appearances as an actress on </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Star Trek: The Next Generation </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">and holds nine honorary doctorates in science, engineering, letters, and humanities.

32066	The Blazers clinched their fifth win of the season	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blair girls’ varsity volleyball team (5-0) beat the Kennedy Cavaliers (0-4) by a score of 3-0 Wednesday, Sept. 18, in straight sets 25-7, 25-15 and 25-20. The Blazers served consistently and made some crucial plays while exploiting holes in Kennedy’s defense.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Going into the first set, the energy from Blair was high. The Blazers took a quick 8-2 lead. Kennedy took a timeout early into the set, but Blair was not fazed. Freshman setter Celine Wu served 5 consecutive aces immediately out of the timeout, easily bringing the score to 13-2. The set continued with strong defense and numerous kills from Blair.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers stepped up the intensity for the second set, shutting down Kennedy’s offense at the net. Kennedy attempted to bring the score back with a kill. Blair did not let up as sophomore Sam Rodriguez widened the lead with 4 aces. As the game continued, the Blazers seemed to tire, shanking two consecutive serves, bringing the score to 21-14. Nonetheless, Blair took advantage of Kennedy’s lack of communication between players and pulled out victorious, 25-15.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The third set started off slow for the Blazers. Kennedy brought the energy as they sent Blair’s defense diving with several sets deep into the court. The game inched along, and Kennedy followed Blair point by point. Blair’s offense seemed to fluster with a double contact and several missed hits, giving Kennedy 3 points to tie up the score at 10-10. Coach Chris Liang called Blair’s first time-out, but it didn’t really help. Kennedy continued to trail only a few points behind the Blazers. The third set proved to be tiresome, and the Blazers barely came out victorious, winning the set 25-20 and the game 3-0. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32061"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“The team did not put 100% effort into the game.

Overall, the girls take this game as a learning experience. “This game is a lead up to the bigger games later in the season, especially our senior night against Churchill,” Co-captain Karen Yang concludes.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers play their next home game against the Magruder Colonels at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 25.&nbsp;</em></p><p><br></p>	32061
33630	Blazers fail to comeback in a nerve-wracking home game	<p><span style="background-color: transparent;">On Oct. 15, Blair’s Blazers (5-2) came up short in their last home game of a great season and were defeated by the undefeated Sherwood Warriors (7-0). With a crushing 26-28 loss, the Blazers remain in third place in the 4A North division.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">The game started slowly in the first quarter for both teams offensively because of great defensive efforts on both sides. Blair needed to score first to spark the momentum that would help them take home their sixth win of the season. Senior linebacker Ryan Frank explained how important that first touchdown of the game was. “The first touchdown of the game can set the tone and pace for the rest of the game, but it still only is the first touchdown so the win isn’t guaranteed.”\t</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">As the first half ended, the Warriors began to pick up the pace, pressuring the Blazer’s defense. The Blazers eventually caved when Sherwood’s quarterback threw a huge 30-yard pass putting them in a prime position to score, which they did soon afterward with a rushing touchdown.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">With the score at 0-7, Blair had to respond. When they got that ball back, they began to pick up the pace. Junior quarterback Kendell Anderson threw short but significant completed passes, which slowly advanced Blair towards the goal line. Junior running back Arnauld Tegom made it into the endzone with a rushing touchdown to make the score 6-7. Blair was unable to complete the extra point, representative of a pattern of special team mishaps that proved to be costly later on.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Sherwood took advantage of a short punt by Blair and maneuvered their way to the endzone with tactical blocks and speedy runs to make the score 6-14. This was yet another mistake by Blair’s special team, making it clear that the true difference in this game was the performance of both sides’ special teams.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Blair’s offense came out unfazed by Sherwood’s insane punt return.&nbsp;Junior wide receiver Jamall Worell caught a 10-yard touchdown pass over the Warrior defense to make the score 12-14.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">While both teams refused to let the other pull away, Sherwood came into the second half with renewed fire. Sherwood’s quarterback made a particularly bold play with a 20-yard QB rush. On the following play, Sherwood’s quarterback ignored two open teammates for another QB rush and bulldozed his way into the endzone to make the score 21-12.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Sherwood scored again on their next possession with another rushing touchdown, and it started to seem like a Blazers comeback wasn’t a possibility with a score of&nbsp;28-12. Worrell, however, explained that the team’s determination to win hadn’t been killed yet. “We knew the game wasn’t over. We’re a team that thrives during crunch time, and if it wasn’t for a couple of mistakes we definitely would’ve won that game,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Blair’s student section erupted with cheers of support when Blair got the ball back, and it was clear that the Blazers fed off the crowd's energy. Andersen completed a bomb of a pass to Worrell for a 60 yard gain with :54 left in the third, and senior running back Michael Dinkel finished the play with a rushing touchdown to make the score 28-20.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Blair’s defense reciprocated their offense’s energy on the field, coming out with a barrage of sacks and forcing the Sherwood offense to lose yardage on multiple plays. This solid defense forced Sherwood to punt; now, it was up to the offense to bring the game back into Blair's hands. The Blazers were officially back in it.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">With 3:07 left in the final quarter, Blair snapped the ball, and Sherwood’s D-line began to close in on Andersen. Andersen managed to chuck a longball with the defense right on him and Worrell yanked down another touchdown pass to make the score 26-28.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Blair had to go for the two-point conversion since this would probably be their last possession of the game. In a nerve-wracking play, Blair faked a field goal, stunning the Sherwood defense, but failed to complete the two-point conversion with an overthrow by Andersen. Worrell characterized it as a “heart-breaking end” to their last home game of the season.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">When Sherwood got the ball back, Blair’s defense tried valiantly to give their offense another chance, but the time on the clock wasn’t enough. Nosoff was also disappointed in the game’s outcome, and believed the real difference in Friday’s outcome was the mistakes made by Blair’s special team. “Special team made two or three mistakes today and that really defined the game,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Despite the loss, Nosoff was still proud of the team’s overall performance in the game, especially considering that Sherwood has the best record in the division. He believed the Blazers played extremely well and characterized the loss as a “minor speed bump” in a great season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33627
33360	What it's like to take karate classes during the pandemic	<p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Back to basics</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For the past 11 months, karate schools in Montgomery County have been subjected to the law of nature: adapt or die. In order to comply with the county's health mandates, some karate schools moved their classes online, while others opted to do a hybrid of virtual and in-person instruction. The pandemic has had a profound impact on martial arts schools by temporarily shifting most schools away from their tradition of sparring: controlled fighting using protective gear.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At </span><a href="https://www.kaizenfitnessusa.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Kaizen Karate</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a school with locations in Md., Northern Va., and D.C., classes have been completely virtual since March. Since most students lack a training partner for sparring, virtual training has a heavy focus on technique, physical conditioning and drills. </span><a href="http://kickskarate.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Kicks Karate</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a school with locations in Montgomery County and Frederick County, has held a mix of in-person and virtual classes during the pandemic.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For many athletes, not just martial artists, the pandemic has required a similar shift in mindset. Instead of competing in tournaments or scrimmages, athletes are going back to the basics, building up their fitness and skill so that when it is safe to compete, they'll be better prepared than their competitors.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Moving up the ranks</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33358"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For Nina Hanisco, a senior at Blair who trains at Kaizen Karate, the transition from in-person sparring to virtual training was far from smooth. "At first, I really did not like the idea of online classes… I remember the first week, I pretty much didn't show up to a single online class… I really wanted it to be in-person [training]," Hansico says. However, her goal of earning a black belt before she goes to college has motivated her to settle into routine. Now, she trains six days a week-- virtually--for at least an hour a day. For most students at Kaizen Karate, the process of earning a black belt takes, on average, eight to ten years of consistent training. Hanisco is now several months away from earning her black belt.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Colin Murphy, a senior who holds a third-degree black belt at Kicks Karate, has done a mix of in-person and virtual training since July. During that time, he managed to move up from a second-degree to a third-degree black belt, which required him to go to several in-person classes. "I wore the wrong kind of mask for the first day [of class]... and the mask kept getting sucked into my face every time I tried to breathe, so there was a learning curve… If I hadn't practiced at home with a mask before my belt test, I would have just failed the test," Murphy says.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Benefits of taking martial arts during the pandemic</strong></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33359"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">When he applied to colleges, Murphy took time to reflect on where his training had taken him since he started karate all those years ago. "I've written about this for pretty much every college application… karate made me who I am today… There's just so much focus placed on developing respect, self-discipline, self-control," Murphy says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although she misses the competition, Hanisco has come to enjoy the daily grind of virtual training. It allows her to learn more of the kata, a series of moves that every student at her school learns before black belt. "I miss the competitions and all that… because I'm a very competitive person, and that was something that really motivated me to train, but I still get to participate in classes and improve my kata," Hansico says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Training in martial arts through an online platform like Zoom or Google Meets takes adjustment, but it has several advantages compared to in-person training. For one, students can train more times per week since they do not have to commute to and from class. Additionally, if students have the proper camera angle, instructors can pay closer attention to the technique of each student during group classes. Conversely, students are able to have a better view of the instructor during demonstrations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Above the physical benefits of training, karate takes the mind off of the stress of pandemic life; it becomes a moving meditation of punches, kicks, and blocks. The shift from traditional in-person sparring to virtual training has shown that it is possible to do at least some training from the comfort of one's home. While it is no replacement for sparring, virtual training has served an important role in keeping the martial arts community intact through the pandemic.</span></p>	33358
31958	The administration created more learning spaces to address growth in the student population	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In 2017, Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) added four portables to Blair. Due to the school's increasing student population in the 2019-20 school year, the MCPS Department of Facilities Management is introducing more portables adjacent to the current portables.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">According to Principal Renay Johnson, approximately 200 more students will be attending Blair next year compared to the 2018-19 school year when Blair enrolled over 3,200 students. "Right now in the scheduling system, there's 3,375 [students], but you know what happens when school opens: people enroll," Johnson said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is likely that the student body will continue to grow, because more people are choosing to come to Blair. "Blair is a choice school. We are the number one chosen high school in the Down County Consortium because of the reputation of...the students and staff," Johnson said. To keep up with this upward trend, the administrators requested that MCPS provide Blair with more learning space.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Construction on the portables began on June 11 and will be completed by the start of the school year. "They will be ready by the end of July, because the contractors have to run the electricity, plumbing, and air conditioning," Johnson said.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The new portables will incorporate features similar to the current ones, including easy access to heating and air conditioning and an intercom system. The portables will include water fountains, along with extra security cameras and lighting to maintain student safety. Students will be permitted to enter the main building with a swipe card.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31957"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Due to limited funds, the new portables may not be equipped with Promethean boards. "Unfortunately, high school portables don't come with [Promethean boards]," Johnson said. "The ones that do have them, I've had to purchase using school funds. I don't know if we'll have enough school funds to get enough Promethean boards, because we have other priorities."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While most teachers enjoy the perks that come with using portables, some teachers prefer to teach in classrooms. "It's kind of hard on everybody when you're outside the building. It could be raining and students could be late," computer science teacher Elias Gonzalez said. "I would still prefer to be around other people inside the building." Some students, including rising junior Sam Lidz, agree. "I've heard that portables are nice classrooms, but it's a pain to go out in the rain," Lidz said. Nevertheless, as Blair's student population continues to increase, the four new portables are a welcome addition.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31957
31950	How to survive and prepare for senior year	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As the school year comes to a close, the Class of 2020 is hit with the realization that they are now the senior class. Lots of responsibility comes with this title: applying to college, being a role model for underclassmen, figuring out your future and becoming an adult. This burden can be difficult to manage for some, so here are some tips and tricks to help you out:</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31949"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Begin working on college applications early</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The sooner you work on college applications, the better. You want to look responsible and on time, so beginning applications and essays in the summer will help you. Additionally, it will save you a lot of time during senior year to focus on your classes and keep up your grades. You will thank yourself later.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Take classes that interest you</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Although senior year is one of the most important years of your life, that doesn't mean you need to deprive yourself of a social life and take five Advanced Placement classes. Take classes that could come in handy for your future. By doing this, colleges know what you're interested in and you stand out more.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Don’t give up, keep working hard </strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senioritis is real and contagious, but don’t let that get in the way of your academics. It's important for you to keep your grades up and stay focused. “I would say not to slack on any assignment in the beginning of the year because when you get to senior year, you tend to slack more and get senioritis," graduated senior Patrick Mcneilly advises. Make the most of your last year in high school! </span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Take up a new pastime</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It's never too late to take up another hobby. Join a club, sport or team. Not only will it make you look unique among seniors, but you can learn new things and make new friends. It'll also be a stress-reliever among the bustle of senior year.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ask for letters of recommendation early</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Teachers have a lot of work on their plate already, so you want to make sure that asking them for a letter of recommendation isn't just another chore. That way your letters of recommendation will be positive.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31949
32649	The 49ers and Chiefs are set to battle it out for the coveted Lombardi trophy	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Former MVP Patrick Mahomes and the blazing hot Chiefs are all set to square off off against the run heavy offense and lockdown defense of the 49ers. We are going to see an unstoppable offense versus a lockdown defense, and someone has to win.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If the Chiefs win, Patrick Mahomes will become the youngest player to win both a Super Bowl and an MVP. If the 49ers win, it will be the franchise's sixth Super Bowl win and Jimmy Garoppolo's third Super Bowl win, but his first as a starter.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are plenty of storylines to follow in this matchup that make this game even more exciting. Richard Sherman, 49ers cornerback and future Hall of Famer, is coming off of a torn Achilles and has played a huge role in the 49ers Super Bowl run. 49ers rookie defensive end Nick Bosa has had an amazing rookie season and could add to the Bosa legacy with a ring. Then of course, we have the Chiefs trying to establish a dynasty after putting together two great seasons in a row.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This Super Bowl is a matchup of the best defense versus the best quarterback, and in this case I'm going to have to pick the Chiefs with Patrick Mahomes. The Chiefs have a more experienced team, and a more consistent offense which will be able to best the 49ers defense in this one. All the Chiefs need to do is slow down the run. They showed that they can do just that in the AFC championship against Derrick Henry. This means that the 49ers will be forced to lean on Garoppolo for their offense, and he hasn't shown that he is an elite quarterback this season.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If the 49ers want to win this game, Nick Bosa will have to get to Mahomes, they will have to limit big plays from Tyreek Hill, and Richard Sherman will have to show that he can still play defense in a one on one situation. On the offensive end the 49ers will have to get the run game going early, and then establish the passing game giving them a lot of options for the rest of the game.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If the Chiefs keep the 49ers offense one dimensional, and Mahomes does his thing then they will most definitely win. I expect the Chiefs to win in a close one with a score of 31-24.</span></p><p><br></p>	32648

31975	How students can create a personalized and more productive planner by bullet journaling	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">High school is hectic, from homework and extracurriculars to jobs and— oh yeah— feeding the fish. Using a planner constantly reminds us of our busy schedules, but using one effectively can be difficult.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The bullet journal (BuJo) trend could be the solution to this struggle: it’s simply a customizable planner that focuses on increasing user productivity. This planner requires an empty journal that the user can design however they see fit. Students can include sections for recording club meetings, orchestra rehearsals and other events; make more room for weekend plans than the Blair planners provide and alter the BuJo method to fit personal preferences.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ryder Carroll originally created the bullet journaling method in August 2013 to overcome his learning disabilities and stay productive. He describes his journaling as a "modular framework" where each module, called a Collection, groups related information together. Carroll emphasizes that </span><a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">the four core Collections— Index, Future Log, Monthly Log and Daily Log— are essential to a BuJo</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. Other Collections such as food and exercise logs can be made to suit the user's needs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A table of contents listing the topics in each Collection is located at the front of the journal and makes finding notes easier. Bullet journals usually include both monthly and weekly spreads that give the user a basic summary of the month and space to write down homework assignments, extracurriculars, and other quick reminders. Users can also add a section that contains key tasks and events that will take place after the current month to give the user an outline of their future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Another BuJo feature, "Monthly Migration," ensures that the user reassesses their priorities every month by identifying unfinished tasks and deciding whether or not to Migrate those Tasks to the next month. The point of Monthly Migration is to increase productivity by questioning whether tasks are worthy of spending time on and deciding which tasks take priority.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31976"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Concepción de León of The New York Times explains how Caroll's system of bullet journaling not only organizes tasks and events, but can be personalized to reflect personal interests. "Bullet journaling … organizes your to-do list, your schedule and your journal in one notebook while giving you free rein to design it according to your lifestyle," </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/books/how-to-bullet-journal.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">de León says</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rising junior Talia Nesin began bullet journaling at the beginning of the summer, and uses it mainly for her summer health class, driver’s ed schedule and daily activities. “Being able to keep everything in one place makes it a lot harder to lose information about when my flights take off or what days I’m meeting people,” Nesin says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In contrast to standard planners, using the BuJo system allows for customization to suit a particular individual’s needs. Blazers can make separate Collections for their schedules, special classes, jobs and even hobbies.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Stemming off the original BuJo system, many bullet journals now include diary entries, mood trackers or monthly playlists suited to the interests of the journal's owner. For example, an avid Netflix fan may include opinions and ratings on the shows and movies they watch, while a writer may jot down ideas or short stories.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Among these interests, artists such as </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/amandarachlee/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">@amandarachlee</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/rozmakesplans/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">@rozmakesplans</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/marthasjournal/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">@marthasjournal</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> on Instagram have most notably impacted and redefined the Carroll system. BuJo users began to branch off into their own styles and aesthetics, taking time to illustrate beautiful spreads for each week and topic. Some bullet journals stick to a certain aesthetic while others change the color palette and concept every week or month.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31974"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Key components of aesthetic bullet journalling include the evergrowing trend of calligraphy, pretty fonts, stickers, stamps, photos and patterned paper. Bullet journals with these attributes resemble scrapbooks while also working as planners.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Nesin adds that decorating her journal with pictures, travel tickets and stickers encourages her to use it more. “It’s really creative and fun! I like how visual it is… it’s also a lot more relaxing than just sticking stuff in a Google calendar or notes app, and I feel proud of the finished product,” she concludes.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some users may decorate their bullet journal to be more engaging, while others may prefer spending less time on the journal and keeping it simple. The user ultimately controls the BuJo’s visual appearance and the amount of effort put into creating the pages.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If planning with standard to-do lists and agenda books hasn't been helpful for your personal study habits and schedule, making a bullet journal may be an effective and customizable solution.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For more information on Bullet Journaling, visit </em><a href="https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;"><em>https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn</em></a><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. </em></p>	31974
32345	With Thanksgiving right around the corner, Blair students have lots to be grateful for this year	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Thanksgiving is this Thursday, and for many students, that is synonymous with family, friends and food. But it also means being thankful for all of the good things that have happened over the course of the year, and Blazers have a lot that they are grateful for.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32344"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Family and Friends</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many students are grateful for their friends and family, including senior Zoe Abramson and junior Jasmina Petkoff. "I'm thankful for my friends,"&nbsp;Petkoff says. She adds in a less serious tone that she’s especially grateful that one of her friends let her pluck his unibrow. “Best day of my life,” she says jokingly. "I'm really thankful for my family and friends," Abramson agrees.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Juniors Mya Taveras and Da'Janae Woolfre gave similar responses. "I'm thankful for my family and friends and myself," Taveras says. "I'm just thankful all around for my family and friends," Woolfre says. Sophomore Rosie Byler is grateful for how much her friends care for her and help her. "They're very supportive," she says.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Opportunity</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Freshman Xan Middents is extremely grateful for all of the opportunities and resources that he has access to. "This Thanksgiving season, I'm probably thankful most for the place I have in the world, and that I'm fortunate enough to be able to live in the place that I do, and have the stuff that I have, when many people in the world are not as fortunate," he says. "I have the resources to be able to pursue my education, and to think beyond simple hunger and survival," he adds.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This Thanksgiving season, most Blazers have family and friends on the forefront of their minds. People tend to be more aware than usual of all of their blessings and opportunities around this time of year, but it's important to remember to be grateful year-round.</span></p>	32344
33171	After abrupt endings and a long hiatus, network shows are slowly returning with a spectrum of insights on this year’s whirlwind of events.	<p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">*Contains a few minor spoilers for the latest episodes of “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Law and Order: SVU,” “This is Us” and “The Good Doctor”*</em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Back in March, when schools closed unexpectedly, we were all a little excited to take a break and relax. We turned to TV, but as non-essential businesses began shutting down, so did the entertainment industry. Left with unexpected cliffhangers, viewers turned to streaming services, reruns, or shows with pre-set releases (“Tiger King,” “Money Heist” and more).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Not knowing how long this pause was going to last, Zoom-based shows—such as Netflix’s “Social Distance,” NBC’s “Connecting” and Freeform’s “Love in the Time of Corona”— emerged. But these shows were visibly thrown together and audiences recognized they were simply fillers for postponed production.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Now, six months later, with a multitude of new COVID-protocols, television is making a comeback. The cast and crew are required to wear masks 24/7, scenes are being reimagined to reduce close contact, and everyone on set is tested multiple times a week. Some programs may also have a significantly lower episode count due to a pushed back schedule and the ongoing unexpected nature of the pandemic; nonetheless, entertainment is returning and we’re grateful.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Obviously, that doesn’t mean actors are immune to the virus. Positive COVID-19 tests on set have forced many shows—ABC’s “For Life,” Fox’s “The Resident” and CW’s “All American,” to name a few—to shut down and quarantine before taking another shot at returning to filming.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Apart from how to film, however, writers were faced with the daunting task of deciding what to film. Would the coronavirus pandemic be included? Was this even a question? Could there be a realistically-depicted alternative universe on TV where COVID simply didn’t exist? And what about Black Lives Matter and the brutality that occurred on the police front?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Eventually, all these questions boiled down to one: did TV have a responsibility to make a statement about current events or was escapism a better alternative? Pretty much every writer decided that it was important to reflect our current situation in some form. The main exceptions to this are shows set in different time periods, such as 1980’s-based ABC sitcom “The Goldbergs,” where the pandemic simply does not fit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Medical dramas quickly realized they had a responsibility to show the hospitals’ perspective of the pandemic, with shows like ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy” dedicating their newest season to frontline workers. These shows were also the ones where PPE seemed to be used appropriately on camera.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33170"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Senior Mihret Afsaw was specifically impressed by ABC’s “The Good Doctor.” “I really like how they portray the hospital. They truly highlighted the struggle to get PPE, and what it was like to watch so many people die,” Afsaw notes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“Grey’s Anatomy” did the same, driving the point—that everyone is at risk of contracting COVID-19—home by placing titular character Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) in a battle between life and death. Amidst numerous hospital deaths, longtime character Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) loses her mother to the virus, opening up an important dialogue of the frustrating racial disparities in the pandemic’s death rates.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Other programs incorporated the pandemic in a more commonly experienced way, as the characters are not part of the medical community. “Superstore” tackles the economic burden of running a store amidst quarantine. “This is Us” infuses some humor into social distancing and Zoom fatigue. It also dives head on into the Black Lives Matter protests and racial identity as Randall starts to explore his perspective as a Black child adopted into the white Pearson family.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Police dramas also took a step back to look at recent events and examine the prejudice on the screen. The “Law and Order: SVU” season premiere saw Captain Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) grappling with her own racial bias, as she unnecessarily arrested a Black man with some serious ramifications.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, a serious issue on these non-medical shows, especially “Law and Order: SVU,” was the use of masks. Characters often take off their masks to carry out a conversation, which entirely defeats the point of the mask in the first place and hurts the shows’ ability to accurately represent the current nature of the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">From an acting standpoint, this is semi-justifiable. Masks muffle audio, causing sound issues on the screen Unlike medical shows where microphones are contained within PPE, other shows are simply using regular masks. It is important to remember that the set is protected, but scenes where characters are carelessly removing their masks appear blatantly unrealistic and outright frustrating. After all, we are intensely aware of the real-life consequences.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ultimately, network television content within the context of the pandemic must be taken with a grain of salt. Like everything else, it looks different right now and will continue to be this way until it finds a new normal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>	33170
32002	Never before seen in its 22-year history, Netflix loses subscribers and faces tough competition from Disney+	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For the first time since 1998, Netflix is faltering. In the past few weeks, the company has lost hundreds of thousands of American subscribers. According to </span><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/stephenmcbride1/2019/08/06/the-cold-hard-math-tells-netflix-could-crash-70/amp/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Forbes</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Netflix added only 2.7 million subscribers internationally, less than half the growth it had in the same quarter last year. Stocks are down from above $400 to $328 and could potentially plummet to below $100.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Initially launched on April 14, 1998,&nbsp;Netflix made its debut as the world’s first online DVD rental store. In 2007, it evolved into the first ever streaming service. Today, Netflix subscribers are guaranteed one location where they can enjoy many of their favorite shows: The Office, Friends, Grey’s Anatomy, Riverdale, Glee and Criminal Minds, etc.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Netflix also has their own original content (House of Cards, Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, etc.) which draws in additional audiences. However, apart from these limited hits, many of the shows they put out do not have dedicated fan bases.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Not to mention, other companies have realized that there is nothing too complicated about consolidating shows for audiences to enjoy, increasing the competition for Netflix. Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Now, and Twitch have all followed in Netflix’s footsteps, releasing both streaming options and original content.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The most deadly hit to Netflix is coming. Disney+, Disney's exclusive streaming service is set to launch on Nov. 21. Disney owns the greatest library of content ever compiled. The top five highest grossing films all belong to the Walt Disney Company — </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Avengers: Endgame</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">,</span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Avatar</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Titanic</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Avengers: Infinity War</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Disney+ itself will cost $6.99 a month, which is cheap in comparison to the $12.99 Standard plan offered by Netflix. The rivalry is growing as Disney is now holding its new movie releases back from Netflix, their designated home for the past three years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Disney+ has few shows for wide audiences in contrast to Netflix’s approach of a wide catalog with a number of shows only appealing to narrow audiences. The content that Disney puts out consistently leaves viewers in awe, as opposed to the several lackluster shows that Netflix has available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Additionally, Disney has a range of services under its belt, having acquired Hulu, ABC, Fox, Marvel, ESPN, and Pixar. All of these acquisitions add to the high quality content that will be available to viewers on Disney+. Disney’s biggest rivals are NBCUniversal, National Amusements WarnerMedia and of course Netflix; these companies also have several deals and partnerships giving them exclusive ownership of popular content.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Netflix is no longer the premier destination for highly-anticipated content, and is also losing several classics to external streaming platforms. </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Friends</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is slated to leave in 2020 for WarnerMedia’s HBO Max and </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Office</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> will follow in 2021 for NBCUniversal’s unnamed streaming service set to launch next year. </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Grey’s Anatomy</em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is also speculated to leave, given that ABC is owned by Disney.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31991"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Over 50 additional shows may be exiting Netflix for other soon to be launched services. </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To all the Netflix fans: Watch all your favorite Netflix shows now. There’s no telling how many different services they will get divided up onto in the future.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Regardless, Netflix is not going down without a fight and is showing that it still has some tricks up its sleeve. The company is switching gears from placing bets on original series’ to high caliber creators. Their latest move was a $200 million dollar deal, securing Game of Thrones producers </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. The costly move is seemingly a masterstroke, since it ropes in talent that promises top-notch content.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Long story short, Netflix is not dying. But it can no longer rest on its laurels. It needs to fight to stay in the game, because Disney+ and other streaming services will indubitably pose a threat. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31991
32830	Activities that make being alone less lonely	<p>Amidst social distancing, political drama and a perpetual feeling of isolation, it's difficult to find the motivation to do anything at all. Even with considerable motivation, extracurriculars and other passions have been cancelled or put on hold.&nbsp;</p><p>Pessimism can become all-consuming, but by turning our attention to activities that focus on personal growth and concentration, we can find purpose in the sluggish days and satisfaction in being alone. Take advantage of this situation to pursue new hobbies and find productivity in our endless free time at home. As actress Ellen Burstyn said, "What a lovely surprise to finally discover how unlonely being alone can be."</p><p><strong>Get creative</strong></p><p>Artistic trends have been on the rise as creative influencers take time to develop new hobbies during their quarantine. Whether this be online thrifting or baking, the break gives us a substantial amount of time to work on and perfect an interest that we never seem to have time for.&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32831"></div><p>Wearable art has become a prime target for imaginative artists, including junior Kinga Nagy.&nbsp;Nagy spends her free time beading together her own necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. "It's something anyone can do, because there are patterns everywhere over the internet," Nagy says. "You can start with really simple ones, then you can start making anything."</p><p>Sophomore Camille Wyatt embellishes her clothing with embroidery and creates patchwork designs from her collection of fabrics. "I have a bag of fabrics and old clothes that I usually sift through until I come up with a design. I've embroidered things like flowers or Nike signs onto jeans or sweatshirts," she says.</p><p>Freshman Claire Hwang prefers to keep her style simplistic. She uses the clothing in her closet as a guide to sew personalized pieces. "I trace some of the clothes I already have along the seams so that I can make them in different fabrics with slight altercations," she says. Hwang explains that making her own clothes benefits both her and her community - she can make clothes for a better price and support local fabric stores during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Hwang also invests her time on her calligraphy page on Instagram, where she connects with other artists and practices her hand lettering. "You can find so much more knowledge from talking to other artists about their techniques and tips," Hwang says.&nbsp;</p><p>Hwang experiments with different lettering styles with paints and brush pens. Like Nagy, she emphasizes the easily-accessible practice sheets for calligraphy online. Artists on social media post patterns and guides for any artistic craft on Instagram, Youtube, and other online blogs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Invest time in self-care routines</strong></p><p>In addition to getting a sufficient amount of sleep, or at least more than during the school year, students can spend time taking care of their physical and mental health.</p><p>As long as social distance and appropriate measures are taken into consideration, students have the opportunity to enjoy the spring weather outside through activities such as hiking, jogging and biking. Nagy bikes through various trails in Md., and even biked to Washington D.C. and back. "[In Maryland] we’re lucky as far as nature - you can basically go anywhere with your family, and even without a car, you can still go to a few places," she says.</p><p>Nagy also uses her time outdoors as a means of spending time with her family. "Making bonfires has cute summer vibes - literally I feel like I'm on summer vacation. We have a firepit in our backyard, so I made a fire. We were just sitting there talking about life and telling stories," she recalls.</p><p>In addition to exercising outside, online programs have made their way into the spotlight. Social media influencers are gaining traction from daily exercise videos that viewers can do inside the house. Junior Alex Jiang follows Chloe Ting's exercise programs with a group of friends to motivate each other.</p><p><strong>Continue academic preparation</strong></p><p>While academics may be the last thing on any student's mind while spending time at home, quarantine opens doors to many online courses in topics that students may never have the opportunity to invest in at school. "During the school year, you don't really have time to explore your interests. [Over quarantine] you can learn some things, like I'm taking a course on machine learning," Jiang says.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever it may be, find activities that resonate with you, and take advantage of the extended free time that we have. "I think that it's really cool that this time is allowing people to experiment with new things and discover creative sides of themselves that we wouldn't have time to discover otherwise," Nagy concludes.</p><p><br></p>	32831
33160	Sunil Dasgupta is one of the two final candidates for the At-Large seat on the Montgomery County Board of Education in the November 2020 election.	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The final decision on reopening MCPS lies with the county’s chief health officer. The Board of Education’s role—and mine, as a prospective member—is to tirelessly plan for the moment the light turns green. Rather than emphasize careful and transparent planning and identifying needed resources, MCPS has contributed to anxiety and confusion. That, and poor communication, has led to five myths about school reopening.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33101"></div><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Myth #1: Schools are safe and ready for return. </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Several questions need answers. What are the protocols for temperature checking, testing, contract tracing, distancing, and staff substitution? Who will assume school health responsibility, given that not every school has its own nurse? Who will determine which classrooms are usable, given known ventilation problems? Who will train staff in health protection?&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What we must do: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MCPS needs to work with families, educators, and other county agencies to address these questions </span><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">before </em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">setting a reopen date. We cannot repeat what happened this past fall—where the educational plan was approved just days before school reopened.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Myth #2: Teachers stand in the way of reopening. </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every single teacher I know—out of several hundred—wants to be back safely in their classrooms. According to Board member Judith Docca (District 1), 100 teachers </span><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">voluntarily</strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> served on MCPS reopening “design teams” this summer despite a labor impasse and no contract. I spoke with many teachers who served—all felt their concerns were ignored.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What we must do: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Teachers bring education to our students. Instead of alienating them, MCPS must make educators true partners. It is time to come to a contract agreement and support and engage teachers so they can provide the best possible education for our students.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Myth #3: Low-income families will choose return over safety. </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">No family wants to send their children to unsafe schools, including low-income minority families disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Like all families, they, too, will weigh the risk against their circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What we must do: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Honor individual family and educator choices. I have proposed a detailed census of student/staff return preferences. Respondents should be able to update their choices, offering an accurate, evolving picture. Previous MCPS surveys had no responses from some zip codes and multiple entries from certain families. More on census/planning: </span><a href="https://bit.ly/2SLesO6" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); background-color: transparent;">https://bit.ly/2SLesO6</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Myth #4: Virtual learning is an across-the-board failure. </strong><span style="color: rgb(49, 49, 49); background-color: transparent;">Many students have succeeded in online learning; many others are struggling mightily. Some students are moving faster through coursework, and even some special needs families say their children thrive away from classroom distractions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(49, 49, 49); background-color: transparent;">What we must do: </strong><span style="color: rgb(49, 49, 49); background-color: transparent;">This variability could have been</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">—</span><span style="color: rgb(49, 49, 49); background-color: transparent;">and can still be</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">—</span><span style="color: rgb(49, 49, 49); background-color: transparent;">addressed with better planning, manageable student and teacher workloads, and pedagogical and technological support. We need a true reimagining of our school day, including project-based lessons that do not require continuous screen time. Many teachers have excelled with little support. Imagine how much better things might be if educators help, planning, and training.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Myth #5: Our kids are falling behind. </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This is a concern, but falling behind whom? Private schools? Fairfax County in Virginia? Other states or countries? The pandemic is global. India, for example, is seeing a surge, and schools are closed. Many European countries are struggling. The worst outcome is sickness and fatalities. The academic and athletic losses are the second-to-worst. Incredibly, students have been creative and dogged, despite changing plans, curricula, platforms, and tech failures.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What we must do: </strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Shift our expectations. In facing enormous challenges, the COVID Generation has shown resilience not seen in a long while. We have now lost half the number of people to COVID-19 as we lost in World War II. The generation that came of age during that terrible time lost learning, missed proms and celebrations, did not play football, and took school buses to work in factories. I know the COVID Generation will lead us out of this mess and help resolve enduring problems—such as climate change, racism, and inequality.</span></p>	33101

The next 12 months, chock-full of opportunity, stretch out in front of you. The horizon is bright with promise and the air is filled with the sweet smell of success. On a crisp sheet of paper that is soon to be given a place of honor on the side of your refrigerator, you neatly list your New Year's resolutions:&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Learn to cook gourmet meals, live a completely waste-free lifestyle, swim the Atlantic Ocean, bring back the golden toad from extinction…&nbsp;</em></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">And then, after two seemingly perfect days, you fall back into reality with a crash. You've failed once again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Okay, maybe it doesn't go exactly like that. But in my experience, post-New Year's failure isn't too different. Since you are reading this, I assume you have also been in the approximately </span><a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2015-12-29/why-80-percent-of-new-years-resolutions-fail" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">80 percent</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> of Americans who fail to complete their New Year's resolutions in a given year. But if you're serious about building better habits in 2020, you're in the right place. This is SCO's five-step guide to actually making your New Year's resolutions count.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">1. Remember that big does not mean good.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Instead of setting resolutions that are too demanding or ambitious, aim for realistic, short-term goals. Rather than vowing to swim the Atlantic Ocean, perhaps it's wise to commit to going to your local pool once a week instead. Starting small is the key to meaningful change. "It is not the extent of the change that matters, but rather the act of recognizing that lifestyle change is important and working toward it, one step at a time,” </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/helpcenter/resolution" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">says</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Lynn Bufka, a policy researcher at the American Psychological Association.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If you want to go a step further, consider abandoning the traditional method of listing out resolutions and simply think of a </span><a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/2013/12/20/why-a-new-years-theme-works-better-than-a-resolution" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">theme</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> for the year instead. For those who find the pressure of following resolutions off-putting, picking a word like "mindfulness" or "connection" to center your actions around can often be more productive and welcoming.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">2. Be specific</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">!</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Use intentional scheduling to dictate how you will implement your desired lifestyle changes. For example, instead of a general "learn to cook gourmet meals,"&nbsp; specify that you will go grocery shopping on Sunday afternoons from 2-3 p.m. and make dinner every weekend. Assigning specific parts of your day to certain tasks will keep you accountable. Similarly, having distinct boxes to check off will motivate you to maintain interest in your goals. If you want optimal success this year, break your goals down into increments and set checkpoints for yourself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">3. Actively keep up with routines.</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In a 2009 </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">study</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> published in the European Journal of Social Psychology, researcher Phillippa Lally found that it takes individuals 66 days on average to turn goals into cemented habits. If you start practicing your resolution in January, that means it will be at least March before you get used to it. During this time, be responsible about furthering your goals step-by-step, whether that means setting alarms on your phone or posting sticky notes in eye-catching places. If you'd like to lessen your food waste, for example, leave yourself multiple reminders around the house to compost any banana peels or carrot scraps.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blazers echo the sentiment of active incorporation. "Be consistent," senior Lucas Brown Decoulston says. "Be sure to keep at it and don't forget your resolution." If you work on creating a routine centered around your goals, they will soon become second nature.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">4. Keep it social.</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To guarantee that you will be able to follow through with your New Year's resolution, follow Pearson's Law, which states that "when performance is measured and reported back, the rate of improvement accelerates." By finding a respected friend or family member to hold you accountable, you can report your progress back to someone and feel motivated to stick with your goal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The American Society of Training and Development found that your chances of completing a goal increase by 65 percent if you commit to checking in with someone, and by 95 percent if you make a specific goal-related appointment with that person. "You don’t want to lie to someone you respect," organizational psychologist Benjamin Hardy </span><a href="https://medium.com/@benjaminhardy/accountability-partners-are-great-but-success-partners-will-change-your-life-8850ac0efa04" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">says</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. "So when you tell them you’re going to show up this week, you’re more likely to do so." Schedule weekly or monthly appointments with your accountability partner so you can update them on how your resolution is going.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">5. Give back to others.</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Your resolutions don't just have to be about you! This year, focus on setting giving- or service-based goals that allow you to contribute to your community. Whether you resolve to donate a small amount of money each month, spend time volunteering or simply spend more time with people you care about, resolutions that are centered around others can make you more mindful and generous. If you are looking for organizations to get involved with, the </span><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">World Wildlife Fund</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, </span><a href="https://www.mannafood.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Manna Food Center</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> and </span><a href="https://www.habitat.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Habitat for Humanity</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> are all great, timely places to start.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Most importantly, don't get too upset if you slip up. Like senior Elisa Zeng-Mariotti says, "don't feel bad if you can't do it —&nbsp;it's human to make mistakes." You have 300-something more days to start over, so go forth and resolve to embrace the new year!</span></p>	32579
32368	MCPS is the only county in the nation that acknowledges handball as a varsity corollary sport	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On Wednesday, Oct. 30, Blair's coed varsity handball team defeated the Thomas S. Wootton Patriots in the county championship. This was a huge victory for the Blazers, especially after they lost the county championship by one point in the 2018 season. This win gives Blair more than just the county handball title, but also the state title, since Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) is the only county in the state with handball as a varsity sport. In fact, it's the only county in the country that offers handball as a varsity sport.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32367"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Co-head coaches Alexandra Cullen and Morgan Patel theorize that MCPS is the only county with handball as a varsity sport because of its inclusivity. "Montgomery County has three corollary sports, and handball is one of them. [Corollary sports] are very inclusive in terms of students with special needs and students with disabilities," Cullen says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Handball is MCPS' fall corollary sport, so the team consists of a mix of students with and without disabilities. The goal is to achieve an even ratio of students with and without disabilities. This helps "to increase interscholastic athletics participation opportunities for all students," MCPS explains on its </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/athletics/programs/corollary.aspx" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">athletics website</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In MCPS, handball is played on a standard-sized basketball court, with the same boundaries as in basketball. Each team has seven players on the court at a time, including six courty players and one goalkeeper. The main objective is to throw the ball into the other team's goal, which is located underneath the basket. Teams play two 30-minute halves, with a ten-minute halftime. Players must dribble the ball while running with it, like in basketball, and no one except for the goalie can set foot inside the 3-point line.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This season, just over 30 students tried out for Blair’s team, many of whom were first-time players. "[Handball] is not well-known, so students hear about it from other kids that have played and come out to try out for the team, but they don't really know how to play," Cullen says. This is one of the major differences between handball and Blair's other varsity sports, where most students have been practicing and improving at their sport for years.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">During tryouts, the coaches teach the sport and observe the players to determine their skill level and how much potential they have. "We're… gauging how good are kids at the sport, how do they work with each other, are they motivated, are they positive, things like that," Cullen says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The coaches didn't make any formal cuts this season, unlike last year, where they had to because so many students tried out. This year some students decided against officially joining the team because they couldn't make the time commitment due to involvement in other activities, they weren't guaranteed much playing time or for other personal reasons.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another aspect of handball that sets it apart from other varsity sports is its less demanding practice schedule. The team practices two or three days a week, while most&nbsp;varsity sports hold practice as many as six days each week. It's also less physically demanding, according to first-time player senior Rohan Bhattarai. Although there is some running, players can quickly be substituted in and out so that they&nbsp;get a chance to recover.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cullen's favorite part of coaching is the same as her favorite part of teaching: the students and players who she gets to work with. Bhattarai enjoys the friendly environment found on the team. "The team spirit is very high," he says. "Everyone's very friendly, it's a very fun sport, plus you don't have to worry about getting benched all the time, everyone gets a turn."</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Both head coaches attribute the program's success to the fact that "Blair is badass." They are both incredibly proud of their team's accomplishments this season. So is junior captain Daniel Dao, who was humbled to be chosen as captain for this season. "This is my second year, and it was an honor to be leading this team, especially after last year's defeat in the championship," he says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Handball is a great option for students who want to play a sport but aren't ready or don't have time for the high levels of commitment required by other varsity sports. "If you feel like playing a sport, handball is really fun and if it's your first sport, you should try playing it," Bhattarai says.</span></p>	32367
32912	With rising case numbers in the state and around the nation, the state needs to guarantee public safety and start reversing reopening efforts	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32911"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since Maryland entered Phase 2 of reopening on June 15, the number of daily new COVID-19 cases has been rising steadily. At the moment, Maryland’s reopening efforts are on pause in an attempt to control the damage&nbsp;- however, in order to see more effective decreases in case numbers, the state must fully reverse reopening efforts and go back to Phase 1.&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/maryland-coronavirus-cases.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">According to the New York Times,</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Maryland hit its peak number of new daily cases on May 19, with 1,782 new cases on that day alone. After that, the numbers decreased over the course of about a month, dropping to 299 new cases on June 22, one week after Maryland entered Phase 2. Following Fourth of July celebrations, Maryland’s daily new case numbers began rising again on July 6 (540 new cases). Since then, the numbers have been climbing, and are once again approaching that peak number from May 19. On July 31, Maryland hit 1,167 new cases, and is still on the climb.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are currently </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">four categories</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for reopening in the wake of recent global spikes in case numbers: reopened, reopening, pausing and reversing. The majority of states in the South are either pausing or reversing their reopening efforts, while most states in the North remain reopened or continue reopening.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">At the moment, Maryland is in the pausing state. On July 26, Governor Larry Hogan </span><a href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/07/29/coronavirus-in-maryland-reopening-paused-latest/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">announced in a news conference</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> that in the wake of rapidly increasing Maryland case numbers, reopening efforts will be paused until it is safe to continue to Phase 3. “We do find ourselves at a fork in the road, a critical turning point where we could either continue making progress and continue heading in the right direction or we could ignore the warnings and spike back up like much of the rest of the country,” Hogan said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Pausing reopening efforts is a step in the right direction to putting Maryland back on the decline for case numbers. However, if the state is to “continue heading in the right direction” in hopes of making progress, Maryland needs to completely start reversing its reopening efforts and go back to Phase 1.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Other states are approaching recent case number spikes in different ways. For states that are fully reversing their reopening efforts (not just pausing), most have seen a decrease in new case numbers. Even for </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/florida" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Florida</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, which had record-breaking case numbers throughout July, the number of daily new cases has decreased in the past week thanks to the reversal of reopening efforts. Other states, like </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/arizona" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Arizona </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">and </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/texas" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Texas</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, are also in the reversal process and have seen decreases in new case numbers too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On the other hand, states that are reopened and continuing to reopen are the states that are still facing increases in case numbers. Some states like </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/tennessee" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Tennessee</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> and </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/wyoming" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Wyoming </a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">didn’t experience an initial spike in cases back during the first wave of COVID-19 thanks to preventative measures. Yet these states are all reopened or reopening at the moment, and are all seeing recent spikes in case numbers.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If Maryland officials want state COVID-19 numbers to go down, they will have to go into reversal as Southern states did. Pausing is not enough, especially since the states bordering Maryland are all experiencing growing case numbers or are trying to deal with the aftermath of these spikes. These states are also remaining reopen or continue to reopen. Reversing Maryland’s reopening efforts and minimizing travel in and out of Maryland would prevent more spreading from states around Maryland.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Between Phase 1 and Phase 2 of reopening, the </span><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/covid19/reopening/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">main differences</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> are outdoor and indoor guidelines. During Phase 1, most activities were required to be outdoor, and gatherings were limited to 10 or fewer participants. With Phase 2, there are less restrictions and more indoor activities are available.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While going back to Phase 1 may restrict people from doing as many activities that they would want to, going back is imperative for public health. If Maryland keeps pushing forward instead, there may be more long-term consequences that will stop the state from making progress in the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Let's compare COVID-19 reopening to personal health treatment. When it comes to personal health, doctors rarely allow a patient to move on to the next recovery phase unless the patient is ready and has completely finished healing in the previous phase. In each stage of recovery, the patient must follow strict guidelines. For doctors, if a patient is struggling too much in a certain phase of recovery or not following these guidelines, the patient is moved back to a previous recovery phase until they are completely able to move forward again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Similarly, Maryland needs to reverse reopening efforts until its case numbers are on the decline again and there is little to no chance of them going back up in another wave. Doing so is likely the only way to guarantee the least amount of damage from COVID-19 in the long run.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Without getting case numbers down for sure, the state can’t keep moving forward. Since Maryland’s numbers are still increasing, Hogan needs to step back to Phase 1 and get numbers back in check. At the end of the day, it’s better to prioritize public safety instead of continuing to push forward in the face of danger. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32911

32864	Reopening rallies put all protesters and non-protestors at risk and aren't anywhere near worth the risk of human lives	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Across the country, protests to lift stay-at-home orders and reopen non-essential businesses grew in popularity. Generally, protestors are not following social distance guidelines nor are they wearing masks. The logic behind these protests is flawed and they need to be stopped.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For starters, these protestors advocating for reopening states have a much higher chance of spreading COVID-19 since many are not wearing masks nor are they properly social distancing. These protests are simply irresponsible, as they put everyone involved in danger. Ironically, these protests to reopen states could be perpetuating the closure of states. The protests can cause the spread of COVID-19, which would force states to maintain their closed state.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">During a </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/operation-gridlock-lansing-michigan-protest-ambulance-gretchen-whitmer-social-distancing-coronavirus-a9468756.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Michigan protest</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, an ambulance was forced to slow down because the protest was in the way of its path. This protest was advocating for stay-at-home orders to be lifted. At this point, the danger goes further than COVID-19. Now, the protests are directly putting people that shouldn't be involved at risk.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A main concern of anti-quarantine protestors is the growing unemployment rate. It’s true that unemployment is rapidly increasing due to the coronavirus, which leads to less consumer spending. </span><a href="https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Unemployment</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> has soared from 4.4 percent in March to 14.7 percent in April.

The stimulus checks and unemployment payments have been helping a bit with promoting spending, but it's clearly not enough. In this time of economic struggle, banks are using </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/05/18/negative-interest-rates-explained-how-could-they-affect-you/#35fc18057b46" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">negative rates</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in savings accounts. This can be helpful for the economy because it would punish people for saving money, so spending will increase. On the other hand, some people may not want to spend their money because they are out of work and have no income.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While this is rightfully a major concern, the U.S. was able to climb out of the Great Depression through unconventional routes in the New Deal. Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang pushed an idea of universal basic income (UBI), </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">which could</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> help create more jobs, make families stronger, and create a more balanced playing field for Americans in the economy. The UBI proposal can easily be successful by increasing taxes for the wealthy.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Multi-billionaire and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is set to be the </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/05/14/jeff-bezos-worlds-first-trillionaire-sparks-heated-debate/5189161002/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">world's first trillionaire</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">. His current net worth is around 143 billion dollars and it is rapidly increasing as Amazon flourishes during the COVID-19 pandemic. If Bezos was given a wealth tax of four percent, he would pay about 5.8 billion dollars in taxes, which could support another plan like the New Deal or UBI to revive the economy.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Some people of the anti-quarantine persuasion believe that just the vulnerable should stay home to prevent that group of people from getting it. Even if people go out, they can bring it to the high-risk individuals in their home. This is extremely unsafe, as it can never be known who will feel the worst effects or who will be asymptomatic. People shouldn't have to risk their lives just for the economy's revival. In addition, a lot of young people have underlying conditions. Type 2 diabetes has been a </span><a href="https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/statistics-about-diabetes" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">common problem</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for the American youth, as it affects 1 in every 400 Americans aged 20 years and younger, and cases for all Americans increase by 1.5 million every year. There are also undiagnosed conditions that people have, which could put those people at major risk. Therefore, it is irresponsible for protestors to assume who is vulnerable and it is irresponsible for them to claim that keeping the ill and elderly home will be the best solution. Especially in places like </span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/imm/covid-19-daily-data-summary-deaths-05132020-1.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">New York</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, a large number of people who died from the virus didn't have any underlying conditions.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Similarly, another flawed argument was highlighted when a man posted a video of his dispute with a Costco employee, claiming that he was not wearing a mask because he "woke up in a free country." A free country also reserves the right for companies like Costco to create policies for the people visiting their private property.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">They also contend that the United States never quarantined for swine flu or SARS. However, the coronavirus is highly contagious and more deadly than swine flu or SARS. </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">In the U.S.</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, there have been over 1,720,613 confirmed cases with about 101,573 deaths. It's almost like comparing apples and oranges. According to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/us/reopening-the-economy-flawed-arguments-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">CNN</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, swine flu infected 60 million Americans in a year, but it is not nearly as lethal as the common flu. SARS was very lethal, killing 800 Americans, but not nearly as contagious, only infecting 8,000.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It’s not difficult to wear a mask when you go out and keep a proper social distance. It may be seen as an inconvenience, but no inconvenience outweighs the lives of our friends, family, and community. We will be able to get out of this economic crisis if we consider unconventional routes, and we will get out of this pandemic if we can all cooperate to help stop the spread. If the protests for reopening stop, we will get out of the economic drought sooner than later.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the nationwide George Floyd protests, social distancing and masks have been required and/or encouraged. The George Floyd protests are actually making big steps towards racial justice, whereas rallies to reopen states are counterproductive because they just perpetuate the spread which is causing the economy to remain closed.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The reality of protestors wanting to reopen an economy in the middle of a global pandemic is a sign that some people care more about the economy than one's health. However, protesting is a powerful tool, and rallies that advocate social justice and dynamic change in policing and race relations are urgent. The George Floyd protests are causing change, change that has been long overdue.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32863
32020	Welcome to SCO's 2019 rendition of weekly NFL predictions.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Welcome to SCO's 2019 rendition of Weekly NFL Predictions. We've got a great lineup of sportsologists this year. Andrew, returning from last year, as well as Alex, Lucie, Sam, and Billy. We missed week one, due to it being the first week of school, but we're ready for an exciting week two and a great rest of the season!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Buccaneers at Panthers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: Last week, the Panthers went toe-to-toe with the defending NFC champions. They should have a much easier time with the weak Tampa Bay squad. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Panthers</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Bucs did not look like a very good team in their season opener, while the Panthers competed with a very good Rams team. As long as the Panthers play another game like last week they should win. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Panthers</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey played one of the best games of his career last week. As long as QB Cam Newton plays better than he did on Sunday, the Panthers should have this game in the bag. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Panthers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: It only took us four years to realize Jameis Winston is not a franchise QB. The former first overall pick has struggled during his time in the NFL, and this season looks to be no different. Winston threw three INTs in Week 1 against the 49ers. I expect him to throw another three against the Panthers. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Panthers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Christian McCaffrey had a stunning performance in Carolina's loss against the Rams. Jameis Winston, on the other hand, continued to look like a bust. If McCaffrey can produce the way he did last week, and Cam Newton can step up his game, they'll blow out the Bucs. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Panthers</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cardinals at Ravens</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: The Cardinals didn't have the number one overall pick in the 2019 draft because they were good. Even with Kyler Murray, they team is not very good at all. Man, the Ravens got lucky with the first two games of their season. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Ravens</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Cardinals tied the Lions in a dog fight last week, seeing that it was against the Lions it's not that impressive. The Ravens however lit up the scoreboard against a not so stellar Miami team, but even so they looked like an early Superbowl contender. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Ravens</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: After watching the Ravens crush the Dolphins last week, the Cardinals should be worried. Kyler Murray may have been great in college, but his performance last week left something to be desired. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Ravens</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Are the Ravens for real? We have all been wondering this ever since Baltimore absolutely dominated the Dolphins last week 59-10. While I do think we need to cool it with the Ravens hype, they'll get another easy win against a weak Cardinals team. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Ravens</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: That performance from Baltimore last week was insane. Arizona's defense will have no chance to stop the high-octane offense, and their offense, led by David Johnson and Kyler Murray, simply won't be able to keep up. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Ravens</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chargers at Lions</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: The Lions couldn't beat the Cardinals. How are they supposed to take down an uber talented Los Angeles team. In this battle of the blues, Powder will beat Honolulu.</span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Winner:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chargers</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Chargers were projected to have a great season this year, but are without star running back Melvin Gordon, and the Lions are coming off of a tie with the Cardinals last week and are looking for their first win. The Lions will pull this one off with Matthew Stafford carrying the team. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Lions</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Last week, the Lions allowed the worst team in the league from last year to make up an 18-point deficit to force the game into overtime. The Chargers shouldn't have much difficulty with them. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chargers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: I am very high on the Chargers this year and think they could be a legitimate Super Bowl contender. However, this is a trap game for LA as they look ahead to a bout against the Texans next week. The Lions will pull out a win against a quality opponent. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Lions</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: The Chargers' offense looked great without Melvin Gordon, and the Lions' offense didn't look too bad despite tying with Arizona. This will be a close one, but I think the Chargers will be able to squeeze it out. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chargers</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Colts at Titans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: Call me foolish, but I am really buying the Titans hype. They handily defeated the Browns, who a lot of people thought highly of coming into this season. Watch out for a Tennessee victory over the unlucky (pun intended) Colts. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Titans</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Colts still looked like a good team even without former quarterback Andrew Luck, but the Titans looked even better shutting down a hyped up Browns team in week one. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Titans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: The Colts put up a solid performance against the Chargers last week, but the same can be said for the Titans. It will come down to the Titans' defense. If they play the same way they did last week, they should win. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Titans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: There's a reason the Colts signed Jacoby Brissett to a </span><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">two-year, $30 million contract shortly after Andrew Luck retired. His ability to scramble out of the pocket and create big plays out of nothing makes him a top-15 NFL QB. The Colts sneak by the Titans thanks to some good play by Brissett. </span><strong style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Winner: Colts</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: The Titans were able to destroy the team with the best odds of winning the Super Bowl on both sides of the field. That being said, Indianapolis certainly exceeded expectations last week, and Jacoby Brissett looked great but they will fall to Tennessee. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Titans</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">49ers at Bengals</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: This game will be really close, and both teams have a chance at a victory. However, the Bengals' Joe Mixon, who got injured during the game, is questionable to play. Without Mixon, the team will struggle. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: 49ers</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: This game will come down to defense since the bengals won't have Joe Mixon and the 49ers don't have a very good offense. Meaning the 49ers will win in a low scoring affair based off of their lockdown defense in week 1. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: 49ers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Without Joe Mixon, the Bengals' offense will be lacking. They might still stand a chance, but the odds aren't in their favor. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: 49ers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Everyone assumed the Bengals would be tanking for Tua this season but they actually played pretty well against the Seahawks in week 1. Who knows if Andy Dalton can throw for 400 yards every game, but if Mixon is healthy the Bengals can still beat mediocre teams like the 49ers. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bengals</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Cincinnati's offense looked pretty slow,and with the absence of Joe Mixon, it'll be hard for them to get some points on the board. The 49ers defense looked strong in Week 1, and they'll be able to lock down the Bengals' offense and secure a close win. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: 49ers</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Jaguars at Texans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: The Texans hung in there against a tough New Orleans team. They proved that they can play with the big boys of the NFL. They'll be able to handle the Jaguars without Nick Foles. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Texans</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: There is not much to be said about this game. The Jaguars just lost their star quarterback Nick Foles, to injury in week one, and the Texans are one of the best teams in the league. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Texans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: With Nick Foles out of the picture, the Jags don't stand a chance. Gardner Minshew has potential, but isn't on Foles' level yet. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Texans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Gardner Minshew was a beast in college but transitioning to the NFL takes some time. The Texans win big against the Jags. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Texans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Gardner Minshew put up some great numbers after the injury to Nick Foles, but the Jacksonville defense won't be able to stop Deshaun Watson and the Houston offense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Texans</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Vikings at Packers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: After the low-scoring battle in the opening game of the season, people are saying that the Packers could be in playoff contention this season. But I don't think enough people are talking about how dominant the Vikings were against the underrated Falcons. Watch out for the Vikings to win this one on the road. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Vikings</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Vikings had a blowout win against the Falcons in week one and looked like the team they were two years ago. Whereas the Packers stole a win at Soldier field in a low scoring game in week one. It will be another close division match for the Packers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner:&nbsp;Packers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: It should be an interesting game. The Packers' defense looked strong in Week 1, but so did the Vikings' offense. The Packers might have the edge on this one. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Packers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Like Andrew, I believe people are not talking about the Viking's win over the Falcons as much as they should. Atlanta has a good football team but the Vikings handled them easily last week. I like the Vikings to win again on Sunday. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Vikings</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Green Bay's offense may have looked slow last week, but let's not forget that the Chicago defense is very dominant. Green Bay's defense looked great, but Minnesota's dominating performance in week 1 was extremely promising. This game will be down-to-the-wire and the Packers will edge it out. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Packers</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cowboys at Washington</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: Last week, Washington looked unbeatable… in the first half. That second half was ugly. The Cowboys played okay, but underwhelmingly, against the Giants. They should've demolished them. The Cowboys didn't give it their all last week, and they won't again this week. I think coach Jay Gruden will get his team back on track. Call me biased if you want. #HTTR </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Washington</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: Washington looked really good in the first half of week one but fell apart after injuries to running back Darius Guice and star defensive tackle Jonathan Allen. The Cowboys looked strong against the Giants, but then again it's the Giants. I'm still going to have to take the healthy team. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Cowboys</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Washington's defense looked awful in the second half against the Eagles. The Cowboys didn't look great, either. They should've won by much more than they did, but their defense isn't going to give Case Keenum as easy of a time as the Eagles did. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Cowboys</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: The Redskins will get up for this home rivalry game against Dallas but they won't be able to sustain their first half magic from last week. Zeke Elliot is back for good which means the Boys should be able to hang a big number on the Skins. Unfortunately the hometown team will be off to a rocky start. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Cowboys</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: In the first half of last week's game, Washington's offense looked like a top-five offense in the league. Dallas didn't look great against the Giants, and if Washington can repeat that first half offensive performance, they'll tear up the Cowboys defense. But that probably won't happen. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Cowboys</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> (p.s. Still #HTTR forever and always)</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Seahawks at Steelers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: The Steelers were awful against the Super Bowl champion Patriots. This week, they'll get redemption. The Seahawks could barely beat the Bengals. Pittsburgh will regroup and play some high quality football this week, against a weaker opponent. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Steelers</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Steelers got destroyed by the Patriots in week one, and have a worse team than last year. The Seahawks just got star defensive end Jadeveon Clowney in a trade, and I think he will be the difference in this one. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Seahawks</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Neither team had a great game Week 1. The Patriots dominated the Steelers, and the Seahawks just barely pulled out a win over the Bengals. After such an embarrassing loss, the Steelers are sure to get their act together and come through with a win this week. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Steelers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Honestly I have no idea who to pick in this matchup of former NFL greats. The Seahawks have some weaknesses yet are still a solid team that could make some noise in the NFC West. The Steelers looked downright awful against the Patriots on Sunday Night Football, but still have the offensive weapons to get back on track. I'll take the Steelers by a hair. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Steelers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: After a lackluster performance from Pittsburgh last week, and the talent of Seattle's offense, I can't see the Steelers coming out on top in this one. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Seahawks</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bills at Giants</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: After coming back from a 13-point deficit, the Bills are red-hot coming into this game. Although neither of these squads are great, the Bills are better, and will win this game. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bills</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Bills had a big comeback win last week against the Jets, and are looking to go 2-0 against a not so good Giants team. However, I think this week is going to be all Saquon Barkley. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Giants</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: The Bills had an impressive comeback against the Jets last week, but the Giants have the home field advantage. Eli Manning will throw cleaner passes and Saquon Barkley will get lots of opportunities to carry the ball against a weak Bills' run defense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Giants</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Could the Bills actually start 2-0? They've got a great shot to get there this weekend against the Giants. Bills Mafia invades NYC once again to cheer Buffalo to their first 2-0 start since 2014. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bills</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Josh Allen and the Buffalo offense looked great in the comeback win over the Jets. The Giants' offense also seemed surprisingly dominant, but the Bills' defense held the Jets to just 243 yards, and I think the better defense will win. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bills</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Patriots at Dolphins</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: I think the Dolphins are the worst team in the league. On the other hand, I think the Patriots will win the Superbowl. No miracle this year. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Patriots</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Dolphins look like they are tanking for a good draft pick this year and may even go 0-16. So I don't think they will stand a chance against the Superbowl champs who just added Antonio Brown. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Patriots</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Tom Brady and the Pats look as good as ever. The Dolphins look terrible. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Patriots</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: The Dolphins are tanking. The Patriots are not. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Patriots</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: This should be self-explanatory. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Patriots</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Chiefs at Raiders</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: Yes, the Raiders won last week. Yes, Josh Jacobs looked excellent in his first NFL game. But will the Raiders win against a team that is one of the favorites to win the Superbowl this year? No. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Raiders have a good running back sure, but that won't help them stop the best offense in the league. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Oakland looked strong last week, but KC is just too good. They have one of the best offensive lines in the NFL, and there's very little that the Raiders can do to stop them. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: The Raiders sure looked good last week against the Broncos. Derek Carr was chucking the ball all over the field to Tyrell Williams. Josh Jacobs was running like a veteran back. The offense was explosive to say the least and can put up big numbers against a bad Chiefs defense. But KC is just too strong offensively. I'll play it safe with the pick. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Oakland looked great and all but I simply don't think they can beat Kansas City. The Chiefs' offense is simply too good. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Saints at Rams</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: For sure, this will be the game of the week. A rematch of the last seasons NFC championship. And I think the Rams will prevail again. They looked really good against Carolina. Gurley played well, the trio of wide receivers looked good too. The Rams are going to keep all cylinders firing and pull out the win in this slugfest. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Rams</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: This is going to be a great game. The Saints are coming off of a miracle win against the Texans, making a 58 yard field goal for the win. And the Rams came out of a shootout in Carolina as the winner. It's really just a toss up. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Saints</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: The Saints are ready for revenge after a missed pass interference call in last season's NFC championship. The Saints have a consistent offense, and although it will be a close game, New Orleans is going to come out on top. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Saints</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Without a completely healthy Todd Gurley, the Rams offense should take a step back this year. This opens the door for teams like the Saints, who just missed out on the Super Bowl last season. I see the Rams taking a step back and the Saints stepping up to take their place. New Orleans wins big in this one. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Saints</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: This is going to be an amazing game. With both teams coming off a win, both teams are hot and ready for battle. New Orleans' offense was absolutely ridiculous against Houston, and without a healthy Todd Gurley, Los Angeles won't be able to keep up with the Saints. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Saints</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bears at Broncos</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: Both of these teams left a lot to be desired after their week 1 performances. The Broncos just couldn't get any sort of momentum against the underdog Raiders. The Bears just failed to play good football. I'm going to put my trust in reigning coach of the year Matt Nagy to turn things around, and take Chicago. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bears</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Bears offense played terrible, but I still have faith in my guy Mitchell Trubisky, and it would be surprising if the best defense in the league let this game slip away from them. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bears</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Chicago didn't look good last week. QB Mitchell Trubisky played terribly, but the Broncos weren't much better. However, if Joe Flacco can keep his second half momentum from last week, they should have a decent shot at a win. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Broncos</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Boy the Bears were bad last weekend. Mitch Trubisky reminded me more of Ryan Tannehill than a Pro Bowl QB and the offense looked completely out of sync. The Broncos take advantage of Trubisky's struggles and improve to 1-1. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Broncos</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: This will be a low-scoring, defensive battle, and the Bears have a better offense and a better defense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bears</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Eagles at Falcons</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: I really like the Falcons this season. The offense is deep and talented, the defense has a few stars. Be prepared to see them in the playoff conversation later this year. They may have lost week 1, but that was against a team that is really, really good. The Eagles couldn't play football for half of their game last week, against a much worse opponent. Atlanta's gonna win this at home. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Falcons</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: Philly had a big comeback win against the Redskins, and Carson Wentz looked great passing to Deshaun Jackson. The Falcons on the other hand were a nightmare in week one. I don't think things will change. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Eagles</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Philly looked strong last week, with Carson Wentz making a couple of impressive touchdown passes to DeSean Jackson, and Zach Ertz also making some solid catches. Atlanta's defense simply isn't good enough to keep up with the Eagles' offense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Eagles</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: In the spirit of full disclosure, I am an Eagles fan so there is no way I'm picking against the Birds. Sure, they started slow again the Redskins last week, but that's to be expected in the first game of the season. The Eagles can exploit Atlanta's struggling defense by going deep to DeSean Jackson and Zach Ertz. Philly wins big. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Eagles</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Philly was successful in coming back to defeat their NFC East rival Washington, and their offense looked unstoppable in the second half. That being said, Atlanta's offense also looked promising last week, but they won't be able to keep up with the Eagles. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Eagles</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Browns at Jets</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: The Brown's effort last week was nothing short of embarrassing. That team is so talented, but they just could not play against Tennessee. New York blew a big lead against the Bills last week, and looked very mediocre. The deciding factor in this one is that Sam Darnold is sick and won't be playing. The Jets won't play that well without him out there. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Browns</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: Both teams had disappointing losses in week one, but the Jets lost to the Bills. I think this is the perfect bounce back game for the Browns electric offense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Browns</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: The Browns' defeat last week should act as a wake-up call. They will easily win given that Sam Darnold is out for the Jets. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Browns</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Sam Darnold will be out with mono for this game which makes a win that much more definite for the Browns. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Browns</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: With the absence of Sam Darnold, the Jets' offense will have a hard time getting going. Although the Browns were nothing more of mediocre last week, they will have an easy road to victory. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Browns</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32019
32060	Week 3 has some great games for us  to predict, including the hometown Ravens taking on the Kansas City Chiefs.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Standings:</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew 10-6</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex 11-5</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie 8-8</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam 10-6</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy 12-4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Titans at Jaguars</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: Both of these teams suffered close losses last week. But I just can't bring myself to pick the Jaguars. I think Gardner Minshew will have a tough time against a talented Titans secondary. The Titans take a close one on the road. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Titans</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The jaguars are really hurting without Nick Foles in the huddle so even though the Titans lost last week, Derrick Henry will help them run over the jags. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Titans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Both teams are coming off of close games, but the Titans have been playing better. Derrick Henry has been doing a solid job carrying the ball, and Marcus Mariota is also playing well. It will be close, but the Titans will end up on top. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Titans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Gardner Minshew’s first start in the NFL didn’t go as planned as the Jaguars fell the Texans last week. The Titans have one of the best defenses in the league so don’t expect things to go much better for Minshew on Thursday. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Titans</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Both teams are coming from close losses to good teams. I have been pretty impressed with how Marcus Mariota and Derrick Henry have performed so far.

Granted, their games have been against two awful teams, but they've been impressive nonetheless. Their winning streak won't continue this week. The Bengals have the league's leading receiver, John Ross. I think he and Andy Dalton will burn the Bills secondary and take the hard-fought win. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bengals</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: Both these teams aren't very stacked talent wise, but the Bills are 2-0 and Josh Allen has been looking crafty out there.

The Bills, on the other hand, are doing surprisingly well. Of course, they've only played the Jets and the Giants, two of the worst teams in the league, but their defense hasn't been making things easy for opposing QBs. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bills</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: I picked the Bills to start 2-0 and they rewarded me with a big win against the Giants.

That being said, Josh Allen and Devin Singletary have been very efficient. With the Bills Mafia behind the defense, they’ll strap up the great Cincinnati offense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bills</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lions at Eagles</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: I have not been impressed by the Eagles this season. They could not play against Washington in the first half of week 1, and they lost to the Falcons. And I was really impressed by the Lions taking down the Chargers. I'm gonna go for the upset, and take the undefeated Lions. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Lions</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Eagles haven't shown me anything special this season and the 2-0 Lions could make a statement with this win. Matthew Stafford is one of the most underrated QBs in the league, and running back Kerryon Johnson is coming off of a big week. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Lions</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: The Lions play a great passing game, and the Eagles have one of the weakest defenses when it comes to passing. Especially since Philly is playing without three starters, it should be an easy win for Detroit. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Lions</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: The Birds will be without three starters for this week’s bout against the Lions.

Both of these teams were underestimated at the beginning of the season, and both have impressed a lot. Jacoby Brissett has looked pretty good filling in for Andrew Luck, and that offense is just really good. But I've been on the Falcons hype train all season, and I really think this Falcons team is something special. I've got them winning this one. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Falcons</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Falcons had a rough week one, but bounced back strong against the Eagles in week 2. The Colts have also been looking good, but in a game this close I think you will need a great quarterback to win, and Matty ice &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jacoby Brissett. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Falcons</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Marlon Mack had a hard time last week against the Titans, but he dominated in Week 1 against the Chargers. The Falcons don't have the greatest defense, which should give Mack, Jacoby Brissett, and the rest of Indy's offense the scoring opportunities they need. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Colts</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: With Andrew Luck, the Colts were Super Bowl contenders. Sure, he’s gone now but this is still a really good team who is top 5 in the AFC on both sides of the ball. Don’t sleep on Indy. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Colts</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: These are two of the dark-horse teams this year. Indy has been exceeding expectations so far with Jacoby Brissett, and Atlanta has looked good all season. Matt Ryan is simply turning the ball over too much and the Brissett-Hilton duo is looking great. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Colts</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Raiders at Vikings</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: I was super impressed by both of these teams in week 1, but the Vikings let me down week 2. The Raiders, on the other hand, held in there against Mahomes and that potent KC offense. Call me crazy, but I'm taking the Raiders. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Raiders</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: Both teams are coming off tough losses, but the Vikings are just a more talented team, and I don't see much in this Raiders teams after the loss of Antonio Brown. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Vikings</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Both teams are coming off disappointing losses after great Week 1 performances.

The Chiefs offense is without a doubt the best in the league, and their defense is much more solid than people think. In their first hard game of the year, the flock will get shocked. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: This is game of the week people. If you love lots of scoring and highlight plays then tune into this one. Lamar Jackson and Mahomes are competing to see who can break the most NFL records this season. And maybe it's just because I have Jackson and Mark Imgram on my fantasy team, but I have a good feeling about the Ravens this week.</span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Winner: Ravens</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Kansas City has been showing why they are one of the top teams in the league, and while it's undeniable that the Ravens have also gotten off to a great start, they were playing much worse teams. The Ravens will have a hard time containing Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs' seemingly unstoppable offense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: This is absolutely the game of the week and a matchup that we could see in the AFC title game. Biggest question for me is: are the Ravens for real? Yes, they are off to a great 2-0 start, however they played two awful teams in the Dolphins and the Cardinals. Even if they don’t win, Baltimore should be able to keep it close. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: This is going to be an exciting game to watch. Statistically, the Ravens have been better than the Chiefs. Both teams have beat some mediocre teams, but the Ravens' defense has looked better. With that being said, playing in Kansas City is extremely hard, and the Chiefs offense will be able to outrun Baltimore.&nbsp;</span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chiefs</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Broncos at Packers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: This one is quite simple for me. The Packers beat the Bears, and the Bears beat the Broncos. No contest here. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Packers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: Like Andrew said it's just math. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Packers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: The Broncos have been extremely unimpressive so far.

It will be another win for Aaron Rodgers and the Pack. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Packers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Denver just came off a close one against Chicago, but it wasn't an impressive performance in the slightest. Denver won't be able to keep up with the Green Bay offense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Packers</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Panthers at Cardinals</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: Those poor, poor Panthers. Cam's hurt, they're 0-2, and are about to lose to the Cardinals. Regardless of whether Cam plays or not, they'll lose. Kyler Murray and Larry Fitzgerald will have a field day. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Cardinals</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Panthers have looked terrible this season, and I honestly think they will lose, but everyone else has picked the Cardinals so what the heck. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Panthers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Even with Cam Newton, the Panthers weren't doing well. This might be the week that Kyler Murray finally gets his first win. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Cardinals</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: Cam Newton probably won’t play this week as he deals with a shoulder injury that plagued him for much of the offseason. Kyler Murray will expose a bad Carolina secondary and the Cards will get their first W of the season. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Cardinals</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: With Cam Newton reinjuring his foot and likely missing this week's game, Carolina will struggle offensively, and with their weak defense they won't be able to stop Arizona's offense. Kyler Murray will get his first career regular season win this week. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Cardinals</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Giants at Buccaneers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: Did you know the Buccaneers are in first place in the NFC South? It's true. And these first place Bucs will lose to the cellar-dwelling Giants. Saquon will destroy the underwhelming Tampa Bay defense. Daniel Jones will do something that Eli hasn't really been doing lately: win a football game. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Giants</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Buccaneers looked good last week, completing shutting down one of the best backs in the league, and I think they can do the same with Saquon. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Bucs</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: The Bucs have been performing well offensively, but their defense is lacking. As for the Giants, Eli Manning was struggling, so things can only get better with Daniel Jones starting. Jones and Saquon Barkley are going to expose the weaknesses in Tampa's defense. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Giants</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: It’s Daniel Jones time in NYC! The former Duke QB will make his first NFL start this week against the Bucs, but unfortunately for him fail miserably. Aside from the fact that Jones is not ready to be a professional QB, he has no offensive weapons other than Saquon Barkley. The Giants will fall to 0-3. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Buccaneers&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Billy: Daniel Jones is making his first NFL start this week. Finally. The Giants were able to make Eli sit, which was long overdue. Jameis Winston has been very disappointing to date. I think the Giants will squeeze this one out behind Saquon Barkley and Jones. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Giants</strong></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Saints at Seahawks</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Andrew: I think people are sleeping on the Seahawks. That defense has rebounded from last year, and Chris Carson has been playing really well at running back. Russel and his Seattle squad will take down the Brees-less Saints. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Seahawks</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: The Saints took a hit last week, losing to the Rams and losing Drew Brees to injury, but once upon a time Teddy Bridgewater was really good. Hopefully he can return to his former self. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Saints</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: Chris Carson has been impressive these first couple of weeks.

The Texans almost lost to the Minshew-led Jaguars. My brain is telling me to go with the Texans, but my gut is pulling for the Chargers. I'm going with my gut. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Chargers</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Alex: LA had a tough loss to the Lions last week, and have another tough matchup against the Texans.

This should be a close one but the Rams haven't really showed me much this season. They beat a Panthers team that is falling apart, and a Saints team that lost Drew Brees halfway through the game. On the other hand, the Browns are looking to unveil that electric offense everybody has been talking about. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Browns</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lucie: The Browns have been underwhelming so far given how hyped up they were at the beginning of the season. They lost Week 1 and beat a bad Jets team Week 2. The Rams, on the other hand, are coming off of a big win against the Saints. LA's momentum will carry through this week, helping them become 3-0. </span><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Winner: Rams</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Sam: I said in last week’s predictions that the Rams would take a step back this season.

33457	Why you should consider going back to the movie theater this summer	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">For most of us, the experience of going to theaters to watch the newest box office movie hasn’t been an option for the past year. With the threat of COVID-19 looming in the air, most have been hesitant to go back to movie theaters. However, as more Americans are getting vaccinated, going to the movies is becoming increasingly safer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the U.S., most states have lifted restrictions to some degree depending on their COVID-19 situation. In Maryland, theaters are allowed to open at full capacity, </span><a href="https://www.cinemasafe.org/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">according to CinemaSafe</a>, though masks are still required. This restriction could lift in the near future; in May, <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Gov. Larry Hogan announced that indoor mask mandates would be lifted once 70 percent of adults in Maryland received at least one dose of the vaccine, </span><a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-hogan-lifts-restrictions-20210512-zujv76imw5gf7kfiuxrlzy2ezi-story.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">according to the Baltimore Sun</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">. As of June 14, over half (55 percent) of the state's population has received the first dose of a two-dose vaccine, and 52 percent are fully vaccinated. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The key to assessing whether or not to go to the movie theater depends on the local situation with case numbers. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/maryland-covid-cases.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to an interactive from the New York Times</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, there were 99 new cases in Maryland on June 13, a significant improvement from mid-April when daily cases averaged well over 1000. As case numbers continue to steadily decline, going to the movie theaters in Maryland now is the safest time to do so that we’ve seen in the past year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moviegoers who are concerned about safety can consider the pricier option of renting a private theater room. Last November, AMC Entertainment launched their private movie theater rentals system. The rooms, which are called </span><a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/private-theatre-rental-65421" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">AMC Safe &amp; Clean™ auditoriums</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, are available for rental starting from $99. The auditoriums allow for private groups of up to 20 guests, and provide the full theater experience without the dangers of being around strangers.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/15/health/movie-theaters-safety-pandemic-wellness/index.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> also mentions that theater size is an important factor, too. “A theater that's in a small room with low ceilings [is] very different from a large theater with very high ceilings and good ventilation. So, look to see what kind of protocols they have for physical distancing. Ideally, there is at least 6-feet distance between you and other individuals,” Wen says. It’s best to avoid small theaters with poor ventilation, and to try to maintain social distancing with others while in the theater.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Not only can going to the theater be a fun activity after a year of watching Netflix indoors, but it’s also a great way to help the entertainment economy, as the movie and theater industry has suffered large losses during the pandemic. In fall of 2020, after months of low audience turnout in theaters, many large movie production companies moved the release dates of blockbuster movies to 2021. </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/coronavirus-movie-industry-studios-move-blockbusters-audiences-stay-home.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to CNBC</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, this meant that theaters had even less to attract moviegoers, since there weren’t as many new movies that would entice large audiences.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When a lot of these blockbuster movies were released in winter and early spring of 2021, the U.S. was still trying to handle case numbers and get vaccines out quickly to Americans. Thus, audiences still opted to watch movies at home through streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While this helped contribute to the movie and media entertainment economy, theaters were still left with low audience numbers and decreasing funds. </span><a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/amc-theatres-4-6-billion-loss-covid-1234927642/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">According to Variety.com</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, AMC Entertainment lost $4.6 billion last year during the pandemic, with revenue falling 77.3 percent. This is part of the reason why they were able to open their private rental theaters, since the general audience turnout was so low. Even if movies are still being produced, movie theaters are faltering and need the economic push from audience members.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since COVID-19 isn’t as much of a threat in Maryland as it was before, watching movies in theaters is no longer as risky, and could be an imperative part in stimulating the entertainment economy after a year of losses. So go ahead -- buy some tickets, settle in a nice large theater with some 3D glasses, and indulge in the bucket of buttery popcorn you’ve been dreaming of for the past year. </span></p>	33456
32874	Nationwide protests call for immediate tangible change	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The evening of Sunday, May 31, junior Amina King and fellow protesters gathered in Washington DC and marched to the White House chanting, “George Floyd! Say his name! No Justice! No Peace!” King recalls the protests as peaceful. But as the 11 pm curfew hit, billowing smoke and </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/fires-light-up-washington-dc-on-third-night-of-george-floyd-protests" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">fire could be seen</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> coming out of St. John’s, just footsteps from where King and her family stood a few hours prior. That night, rioters smashed glass and started fires as police targeted citizens with teargas. “Smoke enveloped the White House,” </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/fires-light-up-washington-dc-on-third-night-of-george-floyd-protests" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">according</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to The Guardian.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After the recent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and countless innocent black people fell victim to police brutality, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement exploded again nationwide. It emphasizes long-overdue discussions on police brutality, institutional racism, and systemic injustice in America. Besides being active on social media, sending emails, calling, donating, signing petitions and fighting, black individuals and allies of BLM have taken to the streets to protest for police reform and racial justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This national outcry is drastically different from previous calls to action. With increasing threats of violence from the Secret Service, National Guard and military, senior Sky Bloomer states that protesters must be prepared for potential violence, teargas and rubber bullets. “At the White House the entire park was closed off with plenty of militarized police surveying the area. The crowd was restless and angry, and we knocked over the barrier and advanced into the park. The police moved forward to knock us back and used teargas. It was chaotic and none of the officers were wearing face masks,” Bloomer states.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32873"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Tensions rose and some protests turned violent with fires and looting businesses. King says that she herself does not condone violence, but understands why it may happen. “Black people have fought for so long to be treated as human beings, and are so tired of fighting the same fights for decades, and are tired of being scared, of being beaten, and of being murdered. It gets hard to be peaceful after enduring so much,” King says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Most protests are peaceful, communicating a message of power and solidarity through marching, kneeling, public speeches and singing.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On June 5, a birthday anthem echoed across the nation as thousands of protesters knelt in solidarity for Breonna Taylor’s 27th birthday. Senior Suveena Sreenilayam was among them, kneeling down on the street to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ in celebration and honor of Taylor’s life. “The protest was uplifting and beautiful; everyone was there for the same purpose of protesting the clear inequalities in our current society,” Sreenilayam says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Amid the protesting outcries for change, individuals like junior Kiran Glass got to glimpse a scene of immense bravery and empowerment. “On Saturday when I was at the front of the crowd marching, we stopped and were told to turn around and look. The entire street was packed as far as we could see, and it was so energizing and powerful,” Glass recounts.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The demands of BLM protesters go beyond justice for victims of murder by police; they scream for tangible change and restructuring beyond a fading movement: changes on both micro and macro scales.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">King highlights that she wants to incite a greater change than simply donating achieves. “As a person with Black heritage, I wanted to do something that felt like I was really taking action, like I was physically fighting and participating. The emotion that builds up for many people, especially Black people, needs an outlet, and protesting can help with that,” King says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Protesters are calling to uproot the systemic and institutional racism that exists today. Senior Berekt Zewdie states that it is imperative for everyone to speak on this issue. “African Americans are way more likely to be imprisoned compared to whites who have done the same crimes. I think if more people speak and demand changes to our senators and representatives, it is an important step,” Zewdie comments.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The most pressing issue emerging from this movement is whether or not to defund, demilitarize or dismantle the police system, with </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/us/minneapolis-city-council-resolution-police-reform/index.html" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Minneapolis</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> taking the first step to transition from the current police system to a community-led model.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Glass criticizes that reforms have been tried and failed for too long because of the nature of the police system and its racist conception. “Specific policy measures I hope will be implemented include an end to qualified immunity, more funding for education, healthcare and employment, anti-racism school curriculum implemented, an end to cash bail and more restorative justice initiatives,” Glass says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bloomer, who is of Asian heritage, furthers that this is a time for allies to listen and elevate black voices while educating themselves on these pressing issues. “My voice is not supposed to be heard during this movement. I aim to hold conversations with people that do not understand the importance of this movement, as well as amplify the voices of Black people,” Bloomer reiterates.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The BLM movement strives to open up important conversations in order to end institutional and systemic racism. At the end of the day, King warns allies to be aware when speaking on this issue. “Don’t expect or force black people to speak. Because this is such an emotional and frustrating issue, it may be difficult for some people to speak on it, or they may need some time. Make sure to respect that,” King concludes.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32872
33304	COVID-19’s effect on air quality and climate change	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tFor the past seven months, our world has been one with cleaner air and fewer cars on the road—hallmarks of a sustainable, eco-friendly future that society has imagined for decades.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHow we’ve achieved it, though, isn’t as ideal, because it’s not the result of a climate protection policy. Having killed over one million worldwide, COVID-19 is nothing to celebrate; however, the pandemic has given us a once-in-a-lifetime look at the effects of an unprecedented drop in vehicle use.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe first few months of COVID-19 lockdowns saw worldwide decreases in road traffic. “In China, the reduction could be up to 90%, because the restrictions are more fierce… and no people could go outside for some cities,” Yuan Wang, a climate scientist at the California Institute of Technology and author of a recent study on pandemic air pollution in Chinese cities, says. His study found that levels of pollutants associated with vehicles, mainly nitrogen oxide (NO), dipped accordingly with the drop in driving.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHowever, NO isn’t the only harmful emission in the air. Others include particulate matter, known as PM2.5—tiny, micrometer-wide particles that mainly come from industry and manufacturing—as well as ozone, a gas that not only blocks UV rays in the atmosphere but also serves as a dangerous pollutant at surface level. Volatile organic compounds (VOC), such as methane gas, are another harmful industrial byproduct.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tGround-level ozone in particular has become a growing problem during the pandemic. It forms through a chemical reaction between NO and VOC, and the ratio between the two gases determines how much is produced. “If one is excessively higher than the other,” Wang says, “then the ozone production will be reduced.” Thus, high concentrations of NO relative to VOC can actually turn down the reaction. “That's what happened in most of the cities in China [before COVID-19] because the automobiles produced a lot of nitrogen oxides that can actually reduce the ozone,” he furthers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIn short, while the fall in NO emissions reduced the presence of one harmful chemical, it led to the rise of another by balancing the ratio between NO and VOC, accelerating ozone production. This process led to ozone increases of 25 percent in cities like Wuhan and Beijing, according to Wang’s study. Because ozone gas traps PM2.5, its increase also furthered particulate matter’s harmful potential.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33303"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Strict regulations on factories and other plants in the United States have reduced levels of industrial particulate matter, and while it still plagues some densely populated areas, other air quality factors are starting to receive more attention. “For most regions, the PM is not an issue anymore. In some urban cities like LA, probably New York, they still have some PM issues. But the focus will probably be some other pollutant like ozone,” Wang says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tIndeed, when he looked at data from his home city of Los Angeles, he discovered ozone spikes similar to the ones he observed abroad. “We do see a little bit of an [ozone] increase, not as significant as China, but there’s still some increase,” he says. “I think the reason is the same.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tRecent wildfires on the west coast have also caused particle pollution to skyrocket. “Every morning we wake up and see the PM values at like 200. The number for Beijing this winter was 150, so we are even more polluted than the worst-case scenario,” he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tMaryland is also immensely impacted by poor air quality. According to Maryland Environment Secretary Ben Grumbles in an interview with Silver Chips, airborne pollutants make up a third of the NO entering the Chesapeake Bay and contribute to algae blooms, which are detrimental to marine ecosystems. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s Web page explains, “[Algal blooms] cloud the water and absorb the oxygen, creating dead zones in the Bay that cannot support underwater grasses, crabs, fish, and other marine life.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tAdditionally, poor air quality has pervasive impacts on health, as confirmed by Susan Anenberg, an associate professor of Environmental and Occupational Health at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. “Pollutants are associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including respiratory ailments, cardiovascular disease, and even early death,” Anenberg says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tThe pandemic has given us insight as to what future air pollution policies should look like. While simply reducing driving works for some areas like Maryland, Wang’s study highlights an important lesson for more urban hotspots like Beijing—that without regulations on industry, decreasing traffic can instead be detrimental to air quality because of the increase in ozone production.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tHowever, lockdowns have also shown us the potential results. “Globally, we may reduce about 25 percent of the CO2, carbon dioxide, during March to May,” Wang says. According to the Maryland Transportation Institute in a statement to Maryland Matters,&nbsp;“just a 5 percent reduction in travel demand could lead to a 32-58 percent reduction in traffic congestion,” which then reduces the prevalence of some pollutants, like NO and CO2. Furthermore, the need for better policy is growing, as people worldwide begin to face the effects of climate change firsthand. “There's an increasing urgency, locally and globally, to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and it's based on the certainty that impacts to communities and ecosystems are going to get even worse if we don't dramatically reduce our carbon pollution,” Grumbles says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tTo address these issues, Maryland’s legislature has committed to two major policy initiatives coming out of the pandemic: increasing both teleworking and electric vehicles for the state.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">\tGrumbles, recognizing the global urgency of air pollution, is confident that these local efforts can have wider implications. “If there isn't leadership at the federal level, and if there are still some areas around the world which need to do much more, it helps to have states like Maryland and local communities like Montgomery County taking action in a responsible way to reduce greenhouse gases and also increase climate resiliency,” he says.</span></p>	33303
33260	Despite COVID-19, seniors continue to "visit" colleges	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After a quick breakfast, senior Carlos Hernandez opens up his computer and navigates to Google. He opens an email with the Zoom link he has been directed to follow. Once he's logged into Zoom, he is allowed into the meeting where today's college information session will be held. Considering the pandemic's limitations right now, Hernandez is not alone; many, if not all, seniors are utilizing virtual college visits to gain insight into their next four years.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since the quarantine mandate was </span><a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/2020/03/30/as-covid-19-crisis-escalates-in-capital-region-governor-hogan-issues-stay-at-home-order-effective-tonight/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">first announced on March 30</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, colleges have been quick to adjust in order to follow these guidelines. Apart from shifting to online learning, colleges have also had to adjust their application process for incoming freshmen. Some of these adjustments include standardized test score requirements, common app sections and information sessions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Before COVID-19 became a large-scale pandemic, colleges offered </span><a href="https://blog.collegeboard.org/college-campus-tour-checklist" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">in-person college tours</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> to convince seniors to apply to their school. Through these tours, prospective students were able to view the school's campus, community, dorm life, and facilities, among other aspects of school life. Senior Michelle Doan also attests to her preference of in-person visits. "It's different seeing the campus in-person, especially since you'll be living there. Virtually, it's just a couple of pictures," Doan says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite every college's best efforts, virtual sessions fail to replace in-person tours. In-person college visits have many different advantages as visiting seniors can get a better feel for the college life. In-person visits first start with a presentation, where information, statistics, and the history of the college is relayed to prospective students. This experience is similar to what current seniors have now through virtual visits as the information conveyed is essentially the same.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, in a physical tour, current students of the respective college guide a group of seniors through the campus. During this tour, seniors can ask about the student's own experience and how they feel about the college. Seniors also get the chance to see campus life for themselves and to examine how current college students interact as a whole. The physical college tour of exploring a campus is imitated in a virtual tour as some colleges offer a 3D view of the school, but it's not similar to the real thing.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33259"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This experience is not fully conveyed through online tours. First off, some colleges do not even bring in a current student to answer questions or talk about their experience. With the colleges that do, the time to ask questions is very limited and the tour itself is full of many seniors with many questions. However, during physical tours, incoming college freshmen can take the opportunity to interact with current college students and decide for themselves if they fit in.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair alumna Fran Riley acknowledged that in-person visits didn't differ information-wise, but she noted that going to a college and physically being there does make a difference in the experience itself. "It wasn't necessarily that I got more information through these visits … but by going there, I got a better feel for the school, which helped," Riley says.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Because of the differences between in-person college visits and virtual ones, some seniors have decided on another plan: visiting colleges after being accepted with the hopes that in-person visits will resume by then. "I applied to a lot of schools I was interested in and I will visit when I get accepted because that would save me the time," Doan says. Because she prefers in-person college visits because they let her get a feel for the campus, she believes this plan will help her decide on her school next year.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Despite the shortcomings of virtual visits, colleges still try their best to provide a realistic experience. Some schools, such as MIT or UMD, have admissions officers run virtual tours with the help of another person. Through this method, many questions are answered because the other speaker answers students' questions using the Q&amp;A box option on Zoom. Additionally, some college tours invite current students from the college to speak, allowing deciding students to talk to them and answer their own questions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Colleges also bring in multiple staff members from various departments to highlight all aspects of their college. Specifically, Johns Hopkins (JHU) has multiple staff online during a tour to add in their own insight or answer questions through the chat. They also chime in every once in a while with an interesting fact or comment in addition to the main tour guide. JHU provides pictures of their campus, alongside detailed explanations, to give students a better idea of what their university is like.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One thing that has remained constant, however, is the stress of completing college applications. Hernandez attests to this, adding that COVID-19 has only added more complications to the application process. "There is just a lot of new information coming out, all the time, a lot of changes to the rules that a lot of us have been preparing for since junior year," Hernandez says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even with these setbacks, seniors continue to put in all their effort to simultaneously complete college applications before their deadlines and visit colleges. We all wish them luck as they continue this process in the current pandemic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33259
32647	Australian wildfires affected the air quality during Australian Open qualifying matches	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Australia is experiencing its worst wildfires&nbsp;in decades, with large parts of the country destroyed since the fire season began in late July. There have been </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/01/australia/australia-fires-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">28</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> deaths reported nationwide, and more than 3000 homes in the New South Wales province have been damaged or completely destroyed. Authorities are struggling to contain the flames even with international assistance in the form of firefighters and massive donations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Despite these dangers, the Australian Open (Jan. 14 - Feb. 2) is continuing as scheduled in Melbourne. Players, including second seed and seven-time Australian champion Novak Djokovic, discussed the tournament potentially being postponed due to air quality, but tournament officials resisted. Policies against playing in extreme heat, originally designed since the tournament is played during the Australian summer, are now being adapted to protect players against prolonged exposure to unhealthy air. Officials decided outdoor play will be suspended if P2.5 (measurement for microscopic particulate pollution) exceeds </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/sports/tennis/australian-open-fires.html" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">200</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> micrograms per cubic meter.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32646"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However exposure to polluted air, which is known to </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065784/australian-open-wildfire-smoke-health-effects-tennis" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">exacerbate</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> respiratory and heart conditions, affected player performance. American player Denis Kudla, who trained in Melbourne, said he could not completely inhale or exhale without coughing during his practice on Jan. 10.&nbsp;Slovenian player Dalila Jakupovic, ranked 210 in the world, retired from her first round qualifying match on Jan. 13 when she began coughing and struggling to catch her breath. Some matches were postponed due to the fluctuating quality of hazardous air. In other cases, play continued despite air quality ratings of air pollution rising over 200 micrograms per cubic meter.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While air quality concerns continue, the tennis community has rallied to support Australia in their fight to contain these fires. Several Australian Open players — including Roger Federer, </span><a href="http://www.espn.com/sports/tennis/players/profile?playerId=261" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Rafael Nadal</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">, Nick Kyrgios and Serena Williams — participated in a Rally for Relief bushfire charity exhibition match, organized by Tennis Australia. The match took place at Rod Laver Arena on Jan. 15 and raised roughly $3.5 million for wildfire relief efforts. Tennis Australia will also be donating $100 to the </span><a href="https://www.redcross.org.au/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Australian Red Cross</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> for every ace hit over the course of the Australian summer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This initiative follows the Twitter announcement Kyrgios made on Jan 2. where he pledged to donate $200 (U.S.) to wildfire relief for every ace he hit. He lost to Nadal in their fourth round match on Jan. 27, but hit 200 aces over the course of the Open, translating to a $20,000 donation. Australian food chain Grill’d Burger promised to double his donation and Sportsbet promised $1,000 for every ace, leading to an additional contribution of $140,000.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Other tennis stars are following Krygios’ example. On Jan. 15, Nadal announced that he and Federer would donate a combined $250,000. Williams donated her $43,000 ASB (sponsored by Auckland Savings Bank) Classic winner's check to Australian wildfire victims. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) donated $725,000 on behalf of the players, and the International Tennis Federation (ITF) will contribute an additional $400,000.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">These player contributions will continue to support authorities in quelling fires. But, on fundamental question still remains unanswered: what will the long term effects of the Australian Open be on player health? Canadian star Denis Shapovalov took one of the firmest stances protecting his health, saying he would pull out of the tournament rather than playing in unsafe conditions. “</span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2020/01/18/denis-shapovalov-would-rather-pull-australian-open-risk-health/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Obviously</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> it's a grand slam, it's a big opportunity, but I'm 20 years old. I don't want to risk my life, risk my health, being out there playing out there in these conditions, when I can for the next 10 to 15 years,” Shapovalov said.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32646
31720	The administration informs students about the benefits of academies	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Feb. 7, the first Academy fair was held along Blair Boulevard. Blazers participated in multiple activities, from taking personality tests to designing T-shirts. This was one of many initiatives to spark student interest in the school academies of Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Mathematics (STEM); Entrepreneurship (ENT); Human Services Professions (HSP); International Studies &amp; Law (ISL); and Media, Music, &amp; the Arts (MMA).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">While students opt into an academy in ninth grade, Blazers seldom revisit their academy in future years. "We started [informing students about academies] freshman year and did some sophomore year but then stopped, and no one knew what an academy was or what the purpose of it was," Student Government Association President Wilbert Mora-Urbina says. Mora-Urbina has been fundamental in overseeing the revitalization of the academies. He helps student representatives advocate for their respective academies by passing out flyers and organizing guest speakers.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31719"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In addition to the re-brand, there is also a new Academy Club that informs students about the elective and Capstone requirements for earning an Academy certificate. "We have monthly meetings that capture everything that students need to know about their academy, but also about the Capstone, requirements for graduation and other things," Mora-Urbina explains. The academies have also expanded their social media presence through a brand new website, Google Classrooms for each academy and a more friendly logo.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Academy Coordinator Amanda Wall hopes Blazers will become more involved in their academies. "I want to increase student participation in the Academy program. We haven't had the most student participation in years past and with this relaunch and the newness of the logos and updating everything, I think it gives students more interest in what's going on," Wall says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31718"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Ultimately, Blair's academies are meant to help Blazers identify their passions.. "In the end, we want to expose students to the idea of what you would like to do with your life. Before you even cross the threshold into the real world, to have had some experiences so that you can flesh out your interest, just to expose you to some possible ideas about where you want to go," HSP Lead Teacher Sandra Jacobs says.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">If you would like to learn more about Blair's academies, check out the Academy Club on Wednesdays after school in room nine or the Academy office in room 342.</em></p>	31719
33163	The 1988 classic is the only movie to truly encapsulate the Christmas spirit.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Holiday movies have a rich and varied history in the United States, and Christmas movies are no exception. They can be as hilarious as Will Ferrell’s “Elf,” as heartwarming as “It’s a Wonderful Life” or as strange as “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” And yet as good as these classic films all are, none of them come close to the “Godfather” of all Christmas movies, the holiday magic that is “Die Hard.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Unfortunately, many movie-watchers are under the failed impression that “Die Hard” is not a Christmas movie. This however, is factually inaccurate. “Die Hard,” like most holiday films, tells a fundamentally human story about connection and familial love set against a backdrop of bright lights, green trees and white powder (even if it is cocaine in this case.)</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Die Hard’s” story revolves around John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York City police officer in Los Angeles visiting his wife at her boss’s Christmas party. Their marriage is on the rocks, and McClane’s trip over the break is a last-ditch attempt to save their once passionate love. This attempt is complicated when a group of European terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), takes over the building, leaving McClane as the only one able to defeat the bad guys and save the day.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This plot, in and of itself, could not be more “Christmas.” Like in all Christmas movies, the protagonist is a do-gooder out to spread cheer and the antagonist is a grumpy Scrooge motivated by selfish greed and arrogance. The crux of the film, like all great holiday films, is the clashing of these two conflicting ideologies. And of course, in “Die Hard” the valiant hero vanquishes the sinister Scrooge.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="33162"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The themes exemplify Christmas just as strongly. At the core of “Die Hard,” behind all of the shooting, wisecracks, and explosions, is the story of a man wishing to reconnect with his family. Is this not a similar theme explored in such films as “Elf?” (it should be noted Elf was released in 2003, 15 years after “Die Hard.” Coincidence? I think not). Every single act, every word spoken by McClane, is driven by his love for his family and his desire to connect with them once again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, one cannot simply forget the iconic action, which encapsulates Christmas just as well as its themes and characters do. Christmas is a time of joy, suspense and excitement, and who can feel anything but joy when McClaine fills a deadly enemy full of lead while hiding underneath a table?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What viewer’s body doesn’t tingle with tension when Gruber poses as a hostage to trick McClane and avoid capture, like a child awaiting presents under the tree? Who can feel anything but excitement when McClane ties a fire hose around his waist and swings off the building and onto another floor, as acrobatic and lithe as Santa sliding down the chimney.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">And the one-liners, oh the one-liners! God bless them, every one! Whose heart didn’t swell with cheer like the Grinch’s when they heard the line “Ho-Ho-Ho, now I have a machine gun?” And does anyone truly believe, that as Santa slides down the chimney, he would not say to himself, “yippee-ki-yay, motherf***er?”</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Only the Grinch would deny that.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Die Hard” wholeheartedly embraces the Christmas season and its messages, unlike much of the media that permeates the holiday season. Amongst all of the television shows, songs, and even films with a “Christmasy” title designed to make them marketable at the holidays, it manages to stand out.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Plus, his tank top is in the National Museum of American history. What other Christmas film can say that?</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	33162
32287	For rom-com fanatics, this holiday movie deserves a spot on the bucket list	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On the search for a new romantic comedy this holiday season? Want a sequel to your annual "Love Actually" binge? Look no further: "Last Christmas," a unique visualization of the infamous song by George Michael and Wham!, has the perfect combination of character chemistry, dazzling cinematography, catchy holiday tunes and cliché banter that we know and love.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32316"></div><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Directed by Paul Feig, "Last Christmas" follows the story of Kate (Emilia Clarke), a woman in her mid-twenties, as she struggles to pull her act together following a medical emergency from the past winter. A washed-up vocal prodigy turned glum Christmas store elf, Kate is a total mess. Her inconsiderate actions—bringing drunk men home after midnight and accidentally electrocuting a pet fish with her blow dryer—often render her without a place to stay. She bounces between reluctant friends, one night stands and her turbulent Yugoslavian family, mumbling the lyrics to "Last Christmas" along the way.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">However, in true rom-com fashion, a Christmas miracle appears in the form of Tom Webster (Henry Golding). Charming, kind and ever-curious, Tom teaches Kate the power of helping others and staying curious.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In addition to its abundance of romantic comedy hallmarks, "Last Christmas" also expands on Kate's change of heart under Tom's influence. Beyond the charming impromptu encounters and sweet intimate scenes characteristic of romantic comedies, the film also communicates the theme of helping others, especially at Christmastime. While she initially mocks him for volunteering at a homeless shelter, she's later singing festive carols to fundraise for the shelter just the same. During a holiday with an emphasis on giving and receiving gifts, Kate learns to spend more time giving back to her community and close friends, and learns the life skill of compassion beyond her romance with Tom.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Even beyond the plotline, the amount of diversity present in this film is certainly commendable. Malaysian-English lead Henry Golding, Malaysian supporting actress Michelle Yeoh, transgender actress Rebecca Root, black activist Jade Anouka, Indian British actress Ritu Arya and others make up a diverse, lovable cast of characters. Even within the plotline, Feig makes space for a same-sex relationship between Kate's sister and her significant other that the family is able to celebrate.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Toward the end, the movie reveals a jarring twist that ties together the movie’s title, music and plot. The twist ends up rather refreshing, as Tom's lack of dimension and character development becomes increasingly bothersome, forcing viewers to wonder why a flawless character is so intent on loving someone so turbulent. While Tom's perfect personality initially draws away from the reality of the movie, the big reveal clears the confusion with a satisfying conclusion.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Last Christmas" is everything we expect of a romantic comedy and more, underlining the paramount principle of joy that giving brings. While it falls short of a spectacular film for the ages, the on-screen chemistry between Clarke and Golding is enough to make a good time for any soft-hearted holiday lover.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">“Last Christmas” is rated PG-13 for some language and sexual content and is playing at Regal Majestic &amp; IMAX and ArcLight Cinemas Bethesda. </em></p>	32316
31618	White girls on social media must stop reinventing themselves as women of color	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">At first glance, public figure and model Emma Hallberg’s Instagram page (</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/eemmahallberg/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">@eemmahallberg</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">) looks like that of any any typical verified girl’s social media. Most of her photos are selfies advertising simple makeup looks or her posing in name-brand clothing such as Cardi-B’s endorsed clothing line Fashion Nova and Rihanna’s popular makeup line Fenty Beauty. Hallberg’s skin tone and hair suggest she is a woman of color. Her use of brands largely marketed towards black woman such as the wig/hair extension company Ali Grace Hair only helps to further the assumptions. However, Hallberg, who appears to be black, mixed race, or at the least a woman of color is Swedish. Despite contrary Instagram evidence, she is white. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Freshman Carla Balleste explains how she thought Hallberg was a woman of color, “Before you told me, I really thought she was mixed.” Balleste said. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Some of Hallberg’s followers are bothered and accusing her of “blackfishing,” a term used to describe white people who mimic the unique aesthetic of black women including their deep melanin skin tone, big lips, and kinky hair texture. However, the Instagram model insists that she has a natural summer tan and only uses a darker shade of foundation on her face to match her skin tone.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hallberg is one of many white or white-passing women who have been called out for drifting into the territory of cultural appropriation. The topic of cultural appropriation is deep, complicated, and more often than not hard to distinguish from cultural appreciation. It’s not easy finding an “official” definition for the term, but </span><a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cultural_appropriation" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Oxford Dictionaries</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> define it as “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.” </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The controversy has to do with the power dynamic, in which members of a dominant culture take elements from another culture that have been historically oppressed by that group. In this situation, black people are not credited when white people copy their practices and pretend to </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">look</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> like them without truly acknowledging what it is like the </span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">be</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> like them. The black struggle is completely disregarded, along with the discrimination, injustice, and fight for equality that black people, and women especially, are still burdened with today. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Although these white women on social media may not have racist intentions to purposefully copy black culture, they’re ignorance is ultimately what offends the black community. Junior Sophia Weng also believes that these girls do not come from a place of hatred or bigotry by adopting fashion elements of black culture. “Them getting braids for fashion misses what they represent in the black community, and is indirectly offensive because of their inability to acknowledge that. It’s not spiteful though, it’s just ignorant,” Weng said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Another white girl who has been criticized for engaging in “blackfishing” is </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/9mimmi/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">@9mimmi</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">, a popular Instagram user, who enthusiastically posts pictures with box braids, cornrows, twists, and durags. Braids originally came about to tie back hair for people of color with kinkier hair. Although it might seem for the purpose of comfort or fashion, in many instances, society puts unrealistic expectations on black women to tie back their hair.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair senior Cierra Belton explains that black people do not wear their hair out in afros in some situations because there is an implied judgement that it is unkempt and distracting. “There is always an assumption that for certain events where you might dress up that it would be seen as unprofessional to wear your natural hair.” Belton said. She further describes how there is a double standard when black people participate in black culture and when white people appropriate it. “It’s ridiculed and criticized, but when non-black people do the same, it’s considered fashionable and made into a trend,” Belton said.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hannah Winifred Tittensor (</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dirtyyhippie_/" target="_blank" style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">@dirtyyhippie_</a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">), whose use of bronzer and self-tanning several shades darker than her natural skin color borders on the line of blackface. Was her intention to create a modern day blackface? Probably not. Was it to be blatantly racist and evil? Probably not. That’s not what this discussion is about. Any white person who tans is not committing a crime of cultural appropriation. However, just as a majority of Tittensor’s Instagram followers argue, there is a stark difference between getting a tan from fair skin to bronze skin and going full on ebony. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This issue of tanning “too dark” heavily concerns the history of colorism within the black community and how its roots are deep and painful. Traditionally, black features such as dark skin, big lips, and kinky hair reinforce the idea that black women are inferior and not beautiful. So, when “Dark Chocolate” tanning enters mainstream, it’s easy to understand where the outrage comes from. For black women who are finally been able to embrace and celebrate their dark chocolate skin in a society that often perpetuates that it’s ugly, seeing such tanning shades is a mockery of their struggle. </span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fashion and popular culture are the two biggest platforms for cultural appropriation, where people disagree widely on the difference between freedom to express creativity and taking on another group’s culture. People should be able to express themselves as they please, but when it comes down to embracing aspects of black culture, there are other ways to show appreciation by getting involved in practices and learning the manners of the culture. Black people have endured many different eras with love and hate for the hair and skin color, which have made them such important parts of their cultural identity. That is why it is offensive when white people take on black culture to elevate their status without recognizing the history.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With famous and influential people on Instagram engaging in cultural appropriation, it’s easy to to see how they affect social media and our younger generation. When it comes to knowing the difference between respecting and appropriating, we need to do better. Before getting cornrows or borrowing a friend’s durag, non-black individuals should educate themselves on the historical aspects of black culture, and contemplate whether their actions are appropriate. Many cultural components carry with them historical hardships that needed to be overcome, so if you want to take part in something symbolic of another culture, it is crucial to represent it wholly while also understanding the value of these displays of custom. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31617

32190	MCPS investment in single use plastic bottles diverts funds from fountain filters	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Behind a </span><a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/uploadedFiles/departments/facilities/greenschoolsfocus/FY18_MCPS_ESMP.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">"green"</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> facade, MCPS recently revealed </span><a href="https://mont.thesentinel.com/2019/10/05/questions-arise-after-mcps-spends-415000-on-single-use-water-bottles/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">$415,000</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> allotted for single-use plastic water bottles in their 2018-2019 fiscal budget. Simultaneously, Blair's robust bottle-refilling fountains are characterized by always-faulty filters, marked with a red status light that signifies the new machine is hardly doing its job. While the county preaches a stance of environmental sustainability, their newest innovation in water distribution systems goes underused for key reasons. Why?</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">As it turns out, the filter status is a false indicator of water quality. Principal Renay Johnson and Building Services Manager Alain Perron revealed that these fountains don't have filters at all. Instead, the status is determined by the amount of water that has passed through the system. "The filter light needs to be disabled because there is no filter and there's no way to change the filter," Johnson said. "It's the same water, but rather at a water station."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">This miscommunication has negative implications, as a red filter status disincentivizes students to approach the fountains, decreasing their utility altogether. "I don't know if [the filter status] is accurate, but if it's yellow or red, I just don't go to it," junior Jury Medrano says. "I just go to the old-fashioned ones, even though it tastes like creek water and makes my water bottle smell bad."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Students bring reusable bottles from home to mitigate the suspicious water and excessive waste. Junior Abby Kusmin, Green Club member and founder of Blair Silent Strike, makes the case. “It's a good way to make sure that you stay hydrated without constantly buying water bottles and creating unnecessary waste," she says.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Aside from harmful waste, Medrano points out an immediate health concern posed by plastic bottles. "My tech teacher told me that reusable bottles are better because the water is contaminated by the plastic," she says.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Medrano brings her own stainless steel bottle to school every day, but she's left without options when she runs out of water. "Sometimes I'll actually be really thirsty, and although I don't really like the water here, I just have to drink it anyway because I need it," she says.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32188"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Other students corroborate her concerns. "The water in the fountains is powdery," junior Yesenia Cruz says. Senior Alanna Sibrian points to the fountains on the second and third floors as culprits. "They're so murky because they have so much chlorine," she says. "It doesn't look safe."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">MCPS fails to reflect the needs of its students, who express the urgency for clean water climate action. With hundreds of thousands of dollars set aside annually for plastic bottles that come with every distributed meal, Kusmin believes the county could easily fund filtered fountains that students actually feel secure about. "I think that the administration needs to be more responsible with their budget," she says. "They should think about how they can provide for the needs of students while staying sustainable."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">However, even without these additional filters, Perron explains that MCPS takes precautions to keep their water systems clean. "Every morning, we do a five-minute daily flush of all of the locations you can get drinking water from," he says. "It's just an added precaution to make sure that any </span><a href="https://silverchips.mbhs.edu/content/mcps-not-lead-ing-the-way-31221/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">lead</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> in the system stays down."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Perron joined Blair's staff this past July, previously working at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. While they had some filtered water fountains, he explains that the students paid for it by fundraising. "If the students at Blair are interested, then we should be able to get water bottle filters," Perron says. "I support going through the process of getting filters."</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Principal Johnson is also on board. "I'm always looking for the latest and greatest innovative thing for our school," Johnson says. "If there were filters to be changed, I would purchase them."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	32189

31500	People from all over Montgomery County joined Congressional Representatives to stop the government shutdown at the Silver Spring Civic Center	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On January 9, Congressman Jamie Raskin chaired a panel with Representatives Don Beyer, Abigail Spanberger, Chris Van Hollen, and Labor Organizers from the "AFGE", to discuss the now 22 day long government shutdown. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">With a crowd of over 200 people from all walks of life, Montgomery County rallied in solidarity with federal workers, private contractors and the millions of americans facing the nightmare of a cutoff of public services. The rally shed light on the shutdown from a diverse set of perspectives, the night ending with the unanimous cry: “All for one and one for all, stop the shutdown, stop the wall”.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Congressman Raskin started off the night by declaring the adverse affects the government shutdown has had on constituents across the DMV.&nbsp;“All over the area, all over the community, federal workers will never get paid back and even if the government passes legislation to do that, what about the civil servants that clean our buildings? I am co-sponsoring with the delegate from District 20, Eleanor Holmes Norton, legislation to see that low-paid workers will get paid back every penny,” Representative Raskin stated. The proposed bill is expected to be voted on imminently, however will likely be halted in Senator Mitch Mcconnell's Republican controlled Senate.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The rally also served the purpose of giving federal workers a platform for expressing how the government shutdown has affected their lives. Many Federal Workers explained how they were not necessarily in financial trouble. One employee for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) wished to remain anonymous when explaining how the government shutdown has affected her. "I’m not a paycheck away, but I’m maybe two paychecks away, before devastating my finances,” Lydia explained. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Instead, federal employees are more upset about how they can’t work on the research they are passionate about. “I am a civil servant, I serve the United States of America. And I am proud to do that, but we are being held hostage. At NOAA I lead a team of 15 or so Scientists trying to stop Climate Armageddon and I can’t access my email. I coordinate with researchers from France and other countries and I can’t contact them to do the work I love,” Lydia argues. Many americans working for the federal government just want to do the job they love.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Student organizers and activists attending the rally voiced their support for parents and friends that are working without pay or have been temporarily laid off. The government shutdown is also discouraging for Blair students that have expressed interest in pursuing a career in civil service. Emma Morganstein, a Blair senior, and </span><a href="https://jamieraskin.com/DemocracySummer" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">Democracy Summer</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> Alumni, said, “It’s disappointing to see our government this polarized and shut down over a political promise. If this is how petty politics are, and if politicians prevent researchers and scientist from doing their jobs, I’m not sure if I want to play any part in that type of system.” </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both Democrats and the President are showing no signs of backing down, meaning the shutdown could last weeks and even months. The example the government is setting impacts students and sets a precedent for how Congress and the Executive office value the civil servants that provide public services without political affiliation. </span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31498

"Last year we had our march in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, and we hoped to make a change. There's been a lot more awareness to gun control. But obviously there's still been shootings and mass gun violence. This is rallying to bring more attention and this time bring more change," sophomore Ethan Phan said. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Many Blazers walked out to continue to spread awareness of gun violence, as well as to support new legislation concerning gun control. “I’m marching in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8/text" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-color: transparent;">HR 8</a><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> bill because I believe it is a sensible and viable step towards regulating guns and, more importantly, saving lives,” senior Eli Busse said.

"Gun control is an important topic in our nation, and gun violence is getting very out of hand, not only in our nation, but in countries around the world.

32679	Hi everyone, and welcome back to the final episode of the Good Cast. We're your hosts, Shifra and Vivian, and we're a little bit sad, because today, we're covering the last ever episode of NBC's The Good Place.	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hi everyone, and welcome back to the final episode of the Good Cast. We're your hosts, Shifra and Vivian, and we're a little bit sad, because today, we're covering the last ever episode of NBC's The Good Place. Last night's episode, titled "Whenever You're Ready," marked the finale of the show, and it was filled with so many twists and lots of emotions. It was also an hour long, so we have extra material to unpack for all of you today. That's right! We're just going to jump right in before we get too sappy. Remember, there will be spoilers —&nbsp;in just a few minutes, we'll be revealing the very end of the show, so if you haven't finished watching yet, proceed with caution!&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32680"></div><p><em>Full Transcript: </em></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Let's get started with a plot summary of last night's episode. It starts out with a glimpse of the seemingly perfect afterlife—&nbsp;Michael is learning how to play the guitar, Chidi is teaching ethics classes, historical figures like Zora Neale Hurston are entering the Good Place, and so forth. But in the first few minutes, after playing a perfect game of Madden, Jason decides he's ready to walk through the door and leave the Good Place forever. After his farewell party, Janet walks him to the door, which is in the middle of a forest. Jason is guilty because he lost the parting gift he made for Janet, but before leaving, Janet convinces him she'll never forget him, even without a gift.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Soon after, Tahani's family arrives in the Good Place, and we witness a big redemption moment where her parents tell her and her sister, Kamilah, that they love them both. This brings Tahani peace, and she decides that her time in the Good Place is over and that she also wants to walk through the door. But at the last minute, she asks Michael if she can train to be an architect like him instead. He agrees, and she arrives at the headquarters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Meanwhile, Chidi and Eleanor are living good lives with their friends and family, but Eleanor starts to realize that something is a little off about Chidi and thinks that he's going to choose to leave soon. She obviously doesn't want him to leave, so she asks for Janet's help to plan a special trip for him, in an effort to get him to stick around longer. They travel to Greece, and then to Paris. While they're in Paris, Eleanor convinces Chidi to stay in the afterlife, saying she doesn't want to be abandoned like she was back on Earth. However, that evening, Eleanor reflects on a book she read and realizes that her decision is wrong. The book essentially says that the search for justification of what we do is eternal, and Eleanor realizes that she will never find a justification for making Chidi stay, so she decides to let him go. They spend their last moments together, and Chidi leaves Eleanor a calendar of himself as a gift before walking through the door.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">After Chidi leaves, Eleanor decides to go visit Mindy St. Claire in the Medium Place. While she's there, she decides her final mission before walking through the door is to convince Mindy to become a better person and go through the afterlife system. This is important because Eleanor realizes Mindy is very much like her —&nbsp;isolated and unhappy —&nbsp;and has the potential to live a much better life. Mindy agrees, so Eleanor goes to headquarters and asks Tahani to design her afterlife test.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Meanwhile, Michael sees Judge Gen, who tells him that the Good Place council has officially disbanded because the system is so good that they're not needed anymore. In true Michael fashion, Michael freaks out at this news. In a moment of stress, he tries to walk through the door and leave the Good Place, claiming there's nothing for him to do anymore. Naturally, it doesn't work, because Michael is not a human. But Eleanor sees his stress and wants to help him out, so she comes up with an idea, which she convinces Judge Gen to go along with. They allow Michael to turn into an actual human and live a life on Earth. Then, when he dies, he'll go through the afterlife system so he can eventually make it to the Good Place, and then finally go through the door.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Michael is elated, because he's always wanted to experience life as a human. After a tearful sendoff from Janet, he lands on Earth and has a great time doing everything he's dreamed of — getting a dog, complaining about the weather, taking guitar lessons, getting a rewards card, and saying things like "take it sleazy." Back in the Good Place, Eleanor realizes her time has come to an end, and walks through the door. And with everyone in the gang where they're meant to be, that is the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I feel like the writers really tried to pack in as many celebrity cameos as possible over the last few episodes of the series, and it did feel a little forced at times, but it was still fun to spot them all. One of the notable ones on this episode was Nick Offerman, who played Ron Swanson on Parks and Recreation —&nbsp;which, by the way, was also on NBC. He showed up for just a few seconds to teach Tahani how to become a master woodworker, but his appearance was a pretty big hit. There was also a cameo from Mary Steenburgen —&nbsp;I'm not sure if people know her as well, but she acted in Elf, Back to the Future, Parenthood, and a bunch of other classic movies. She was Michael's guitar teacher on Earth, which was really cute.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In honor of this being the last episode, it's time to get a little ~deep~. Vivian, what would you say&nbsp;was your biggest takeaway from #1: this episode, and #2: all of The Good Place?</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I think that all of the Good Place can be summed up by a caption in their latest Instagram, quoting Kristen Bell saying "Turns out #TheGoodPlace isn't one single place. It can be anywhere as long as there's friendship, love, and shrampies." I mentioned this in our last episode, but I think one of the show's greatest messages is that it's less about the end goal and more about the journey and growth along the way.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Yeah, definitely. So, I would say that my biggest takeaway from the episode was that all good things have to come to an end, which is interesting, because it's a super meta way to look at the finale. I was scrolling through Twitter after the episode, and I saw a lot of users tweeting about how Eleanor's hesitation to let her friends leave the Good Place may have represented all of us, and our hesitation to let the show go. But just like Eleanor realized that it was time to walk through the door, it's time for us to accept that the Good Place is over, as painful as that may be. And even after they leave, Eleanor has memories of everyone, which symbolizes how we can have memories of the show to keep with us. For sure. And I would say that my biggest takeaway from the show is that regardless of where they start out, people have the ability to give back and to do good. The entire premise of the series is that the four humans start out as pretty bad people in one way or another, but they all manage to pull themselves up and better their characters. And finally, they use that redemption to help other people do the same thing, which is a lesson to us all that when we have the ability or the privilege to do something, we have a duty to share that with those around us.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">I think another moment that was really important in this episode was right before Chidi walked through the door. He was comforting Eleanor with some thoughts about Buddhism, and he presented this analogy of a wave, essentially saying that even after a wave builds and breaks, its water is still on the shore —&nbsp;the wave is just one form of being for the water. In a philosophical sense, this is about reincarnation, but I think it can also be a lesson to us that nothing ever completely changes. We can take comfort in familiarity, because even if things in our lives shift around, there's always going to be some fragment of the past for us to hold on to.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">This episode was really great, but if I could add one thing, I would have loved to see some backstories on how important characters like Jason's dad, Eleanor's mom, Tahani's parents and sister, and Chidi's ex-girlfriend Simone got into the Good Place. Obviously, one reason why those weren't included was for the sake of time, but I wish the writers had worked some context in somehow.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">That'll be the end of our final episode, analyzing the finale of The Good Place. We certainly weren't ready for the series to end, but "Whenever You're Ready" marks the conclusion of something that's ending too soon, like humans' time on Earth and then their time in the afterlife. Thank you so much for joining us on this journey this past month as we discussed the final four episodes of The Good Place. We will miss you!

32027	Goals from Ryan Halli and Walter Sosa gave the Blazers their first win of the season	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blair boys' varsity soccer team (1-1) defeated the Clarksburg Coyotes (1-0-2) by a score of 2-0 on Sept. 11. Blair's offense came alive after a scoreless first half, with several shots on goal and two goals. Throughout the game, Clarksburg's offense couldn't capitalize on their opportunities to score. In the second half, senior Ryan Halli snuck one past the keeper for the first goal of the game. Head coach Edvin Hernandez only used a few substitutes during the game, including Halli. "Today coming in, as a substitute player, we needed that boost and [Halli] gave it to us," Hernandez said.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32026"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Following Halli's goal, Clarksburg conceded a handball, giving senior Walter Sosa a penalty kick goal. The Blazers showed a lockdown defense, with senior captain and goalkeeper Brennan Moore's four saves and junior goalkeeper Donovan Cox's three. With their first win of the season, the team is confident that they have more to come. "I think we have a great team and a great coach and we're going to go far into the playoffs," Moore said.</span></p><p><em style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Blazers play their next home game against the Churchill Bulldogs at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 16.</em></p>	32026
31650	Students watched a movie and participated in a book raffle	<div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31649"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">On Feb. 14, Blair's media center hosted a Valentine's Day movie screening and book raffle for the first time. Media specialist Andrea Lamphier oversaw the event, which began during ninth period. Students watched "Southside with You," a 2016 film about Barack and Michelle Obama's first date. "I heard about this movie a few months ago and I've been wanting to show it," Lamphier said. She also ordered six copies of "Becoming," Michelle Obama's new autobiography, and organized a raffle for students to win them.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Lamphier hopes to host similar events in the future in order to open up the media center to the Blazer community. "I want to find ways to make the media center more available to students," she explained. She is already planning another screening at the end of February, where she wants to show "The Hate U Give" to commemorate and discuss Black History Month. Lamphier hopes to work with school organizations like OneBlair and the Minority Scholars Program to sell snacks and fundraise as part of the upcoming event.</span></p>	31649
31640	Students learn all about the brain and its processing in the new neuroscience class	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Next year, Darcy Sloe is teaching a neuroscience class that has never been offered at Blair before. The class will go over topics such as brain development, memory and language and so much more. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sloe doesn’t plan on doing excessive testing and exams in her new class. Instead, she sees the class being project based, “I envision it&nbsp;as more projects, research, experimentation and lectures rather than tests.” She plans on giving her students choices on what they want to learn, rather than teaching straight from the book.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Neuroscience is typically offered in college because of the intensity of the class. Sloe recommends that students interested in neuroscience should be acquainted with biology before taking the class. </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sloe has many creative and fun ideas for the class. She plans on doing a variety of experiments, labs and brain dissections. One of her most unique ideas is purchasing a neuron spiker, a machine that can can control the movement from someone else’s arm with input from another person’s brain. </span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31639"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sloe currently teaches genetics, magnet biology and on level biology. After many years of magnet students requesting a neuroscience class, she eventually gave in, “All of the time I've been teaching magnet classes, students have asked me for a neuroscience class. This has been going on for about seven to eight years and so finally I decided to do it.” </span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Bersabeh Legesse, a junior interested in taking the class, talked about how neuroscience will help prepare her for her future career, “I want to go into the medical field when I grow up and I think that neuroscience will be a good foundation for finding out what specific area I want to go into.”</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Maya Richardson-Temm explained how she became interested and enrolled in neuroscience, “I had a lot of fun learning biology and psychology so neuroscience seemed like a perfect combination of the two.”</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31639
32142	The seniors' suggestions and guidelines for navigating high school	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With the 2019-2020 school year well underway, freshmen have adjusted to the entirely new lifestyle that is being a high school student. Now that there’s been adequate time to become familiarized with the building and get into the rhythm of high school life, the senior class of 2020 has some advice for freshmen going forward. Here are their takes on what to do (and not do) throughout years spent at Blair.</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32141"></div><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Build good relationships with teachers and ask for help</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One of the most important things one can do to improve their school experience and academic life is to build good relationships with teachers. “When I'm working with a teacher I find the subject matter more interesting and myself more attentive if I have a good relationship with them,” senior Daniel Levy explains. It is essential that teachers are able to understand their students to better serve their needs.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Helping teachers figure out how students work can be as simple as asking them questions rather than shying away in times of need. If students need assistance with classwork or homework, they should always take the initiative to request help from teachers. The administration designed one lunch to allow teachers to communicate more with their pupils who might need help, so make the most out of the extended lunch period.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Don't procrastinate</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">With the step-up in school workload from middle school to high school, procrastination is one of the worst habits to develop. Holding off on completing one assignment begins a downward spiral of procrastination. At first, it may seem like delaying work has no effect on how effectively it is completed, but as time passes, that one assignment multiplies until students can no longer keep up.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">To combat this, it’s good to have a method for organizing work in relation to due dates and deadlines. “Have a calendar or a to-do list, they will help so much,” senior Peter Zhang advises. It’s crucial that high schoolers are able to manage their workloads such that their schoolwork is of better quality and on-time so they are less stressed overall.</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Steer clear of trouble</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Any trouble stirred up during the first years of high school will most definitely come back to bite in later years when it comes to college and job references. For that reason, it is important to surround oneself with people who won’t interfere with performances in and out of school. Senior Laviru Adikari recommends that freshmen should “make good friends who will help and not distract from you your goals.”</span></p><p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Balance work and fun with the future in mind</strong></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">High school is meant to be an enjoyable time of life where students start to find and cultivate their interests in various fields of work. High schoolers should be challenging themselves with engaging activities that align with their curiosities, but should also be mindful of their limits and take some time to enjoy themselves.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Graduation may seem far away, but every year leading up to it is equally important. “If I could go back, I would tell myself that being a freshman is no less important than being a sophomore, junior or senior,” comments senior Jonathan Jeffrey. After all, high school is a gateway to the real world. As the year progresses, high schoolers in general should be sure to have a balance between how they spend their time for work and leisure to ensure that they make the most out of these four major years in social and educational development.</span></p>	32141
32052	The Blazers are shut out and fall to 2-2	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers (2-2) took a big loss against the Churchill Bulldogs (3-2) by a score of 4-0 on Sept. 16. Churchill snuck the ball past senior goalkeeper Brennan Moore in the first half, and in the second half Churchill's offense scored another three goals against junior goalkeeper Donovan Cox to extend their lead and secure the victory. Throughout the game, Blair's offense had numerous opportunities to score, but were unable to capitalize on them.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Bulldogs' offense dominated the Blazers' defense, which simply couldn't keep up. "I felt like we were always a man down. Our defensive midfielders were either too high or too low which allowed for a man in the middle to play an easy ball," captain and senior midfielder Walter Sosa said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Blair seemed to be mentally defeated after missing many chances and letting in four goals. "We started on allowing a goal, then missing an open opportunity to tie the game and it takes a toll on your mentality," head coach Edvin Hernandez said. The Blazers look to improve upon these mistakes looking forward. "We're looking forward to bouncing back from this and becoming a better team on defense and offense," Sosa said.</span></p><p><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Blazers play their next home game against the Springbrook Blue Devils on Sept. 23 at 7:15 P.M.</em></p>	32046

31908	Blair sophomore Franco Berrett played the lead role of Captain Tempest in this year's musical	<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">On April 13, the curtain closes on the final night of Blair's spring musical, Return to the Forbidden Planet. Another successful musical for Blair Theater. A month later, Blair sophomore Franco Berrett reflects on his second Blair performance.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Getting the role of Captain Tempest came as a surprise for the young actor, especially considering the speed with which he had to prep for his audition. "I spent a few weeks preparing it and just went for it," Berrett said. "I think that helped my audition a lot ‒ not being super anxious about it." The young performer's singing chops definitely contributed as well. Though his first show was last year, he's been singing since he was little.</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The next few weeks after the audition would bring lots of laughs and anxiety for Berrett, particularly the week before opening night colloquially known as "tech week." It's when the cast and crew iron out any last minute details about the performance, which can lead to conflict. "Everyone's all on edge and angry at each other," Berrett reflected. "That goes for the cast and the director."</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="31907"></div><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">"Looking back on the shows, Berrett feels that the performances themselves could have flowed better. "We had a limited schedule this year," he said. "It was about five to six weeks when it's usually about eight, so I feel that if we had more time it would have felt more natural."﻿</span></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Watching the audience react to well-known songs was a major highlight of performing. "Seeing the audience nod their heads and going 'yeah I know this one' is always fun to see."</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>	31907
32055	Blair's new lunch schedule solves logistical and academic problems	<p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">The start of the 2019-2020 school year brought with it tanner skin, brand-new school supplies and unfamiliar teachers and classes. But the most prominent change to affect Blazers this year is indisputably one-lunch.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">As the name "One Lunch" suggests, administration revised the school schedule to feature a single one-hour lunch during fifth period. For the last 20 years, Blair had divided the student body into two 45-minute lunches during fifth and sixth period. Students had limited options to eat in the Student Activity Center (SAC), out in the courtyard or along the first floor of Blair Boulevard.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32054"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">According to magnet coordinator Peter Ostrander, who led the logistics team in scheduling one-lunch, overcrowding, academic conflicts and suffering attendance rates in split-lunch were the main motives for changing the schedule. "There were three things that we were looking at that made us try to figure out if what we're doing for lunch the right thing," he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Change always comes with uncertainty, and unsurprisingly, Blazers are practically bursting with doubts and concerns about one-lunch schedule complications. Students worry about waiting in long lunch lines, having sufficient space to each lunch during the wintertime and finding people around the school.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">A closer look at the logistics and features of the new schedule reveals that one-lunch not only resolves the limitations that accompanied the split-lunch but also provides a solution to the common doubts students have.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Putting all 3,200 students at Blair in one-lunch in order to prevent overcrowding sounds counterintuitive at first. "The first couple of days were way too crowded, because everyone was trying to find where and who to sit with," junior Sophia Kim said. However, while there are more students in one-lunch, there is also more room for them to move around and find a place to sit. The two-lunch schedule split students into groups of 1,600 that were confined to only the SAC and Blair Boulevard. "1,600 students in this small area versus 3,200 students in the whole school, well that's more square footage per student," Ostrander stated.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">The same reasoning applies to sufficient seating during the wintertime, a concern that many students share. Finding space for all the students to eat lunch indoors during the colder months will actually be easier than in previous years. Students can choose to sit in the numerous tables and couches scattered in the halls or any classroom a teacher keeps open.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Others are troubled by the doubled number of students who need to buy lunch from the cafeteria. "It's fine if you can get here early enough for the lunch line," junior Bontle Mowe said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">To reduce the long lunch lines and ensure that students buy their food in a timely manner, food kiosks located on each floor sell fruit, salad, sandwiches, drinks and other popular menu items. According to Johnson, the kiosks sell between 85 and 105 lunches a day, "which means 85 to 105 fewer lunches sold in the SAC."&nbsp;</span></p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="32056"></div><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">One-lunch also provides more opportunities for students to find academic support. Students don't need to worry about a teacher having a class during their lunch period when they plan to retake a quiz or ask for help.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Principal Renay Johnson adds that one of her favorite aspects of one-lunch is academic support because of the progress the students are already making. "Achievement went up in the school because people got academic support," Johnson said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Attendance rates during the middle of the day also increase since the new schedule lessens the temptation to skip class around lunchtime. "We had a much lower attendance rate during fifth and sixth period than we did during any of the other periods…there were students that were double lunching," Ostrander said. With every student in class during sixth lunch, students won't have any reason to skip sixth period over any other class.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">In addition to academics, one-lunch increases participation and organization in lunch clubs. All members can get together without half the club being uninformed of decisions or events that occurred in a different lunch period. If they are not at a club, students can also play sports in the gym, watch movies in the auditorium or participate in other events going on during lunch.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); background-color: transparent;">Though the administration hasn't addressed each and every concern students have about one-lunch, the program provides effective solutions to many problems in the split-lunch schedule. Administration will continue to improve lunchtime by taking suggestions and complaints from students, teachers and parents.</span></p>	32054
31723	Blazers had three even days	<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Over the course of the winter season, Montgomery County has experienced several emergency weather conditions that have caused school closures or two-hour delays. To make up for lost class time, Blair changed Friday, March 1 to an even day, resulting in three consecutive even days that began on Thursday, February 28.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Sophomore Jeremy Masson expressed relief at the administration's decision to add the extra even day. “My even day classes didn't have time to teach their material, so they [teachers] tried to cram multiple days of work into one class. Personally, I'm glad we have three even days in a row because it gives us the chance to catch up on the work we missed,” Masson said.</span></p>	\N
31915	The restaurants at Four Corners have more than just your regular order	<p>The Four Corners shopping center is the go-to spot for Blair students before and after school. The shopping center includes Starbucks, Chipotle, Subway, Santucci's, The Corner Pub and a few other places to go grab a bite to eat.&nbsp;</p><p>However, no matter how many places there are to eat, if you go there every day, it's easy to get tired of the same old food. When I encountered this problem, I decided to dive deeper into the menus at my favorite restaurants in the shopping center. That is when I found out many of these places have secret entrees that aren't on the menu. So, look no further, because SCO is here with a guide to all of them.</p><div class="content-embed" data-content-id="17289"></div><p><strong>Starbucks</strong></p><p>I started with Starbucks, because they have the largest, most famous secret menu out of all the Four Corners restaurants. They have a line of rainbow drinks, the most popular being the Pink Drink which is a strawberry acai refresher. They also have a blue, purple, yellow, green, and orange drink. Each of these are different flavored teas or refreshers with milk substituted for water. Starbucks also allows you to customize any drink you would like as long as they have the ingredients for it.</p><p><strong>Chipotle</strong></p><p>Next up is Chipotle. For starters, you can order a quesadilla. They also have two secret items called the Burritodilla and the Quesarito. The Burritodilla is a burrito with cheese melted onto the tortilla, and the Quesarito is a quesadilla with the ingredients of a burrito. If you are short on cash, you can also order a rice burrito for a dollar and then it is a dollar for each topping as long as you don't get meat.</p><p><strong>Subway</strong></p><p>Onto Subway, where you can order a number of secret subs and even pizza. Upon request, Subway has small cheese and pepperoni pizzas that they can heat up for you (though, honestly, they are not very good pizzas).</p><p><strong>The Corner Pub</strong></p><p>The Corner Pub doesn't have a specific secret menu, but they do have a few special orders that they can make happen. If they have meatballs in stock, then they can make a meatball sub, and upon request, the chef can put together vegan nachos. Another perk about the pub are the custom pizzas. You can order whatever toppings you want for your pizza. Hint: the chef's personal favorite is bacon and pineapple pizza.</p><p><strong>Santucci's Deli</strong></p><p>Finally, Santucci's Deli has a top-secret, "classified" sub called the Chicken Ding Ding. It consists of chicken breast pickles and greens. However it can only be made when they are cooking a full chicken breast. You can also order a number of steaks at Santucci's, but only if you ask the right person.</p><p>Secret menus are more common than you think, so if you ever get tired of your favorite restaurant, make sure to ask if they have a secret menu. And there it is: SCO's guide to the (no longer so secret) menus on Four Corners!</p><p><br></p>	\N
